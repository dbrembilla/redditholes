0,AmericanPolitics,neoliberal,333,"\>shocked pikachu face.pngWhile I'm sure this article has good research it disagrees with my priors so is therefore false.Water is also wet.Not surprising since the primary obstacles to faster growth are regulatory capture domination of policy making by special interests and rent seekers and structural challenges due to demographics and social problems.*GASP* REALLY?! Who would’ve thought letting poor people die while catering to the rich would hurt poor people?This is only “controversial“ because one party backed by the likes of Charles Koch and Paul Singer have an interest it pretending that it is.There's normative reasons imo to oppose high levels of taxation regardless of  whether it falls on an unpopular group of people or not. I understand  that's not the point of the study and maybe not even the point of  politics but I do think it's worth at least mentioning.Wherefrom do these normative reasons for opposing high tax for the rich stem? Pretty sure it isn't from judeo-christian values.Yeah no shit.Nothing but Voodoo Economics.Reagan was wrong. Bush was right!Unfortunately it might not matter because you've always been able to cite the last tax cuts to say ""these tax cuts you're putting forth aren't going to be worth it.""http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf\s\spaperGuessing this is because Twitter leftists love to try to ratio conservative tweets. If there's ever a right leaning hashtag trending clicking into it will reveal mostly people clowning on it.\s\sTwitter counts that counts as engagement and elevates the original tweet.This is really only something that's a few years old and would not explain the data.Not for me. That's because of the location you live in. I live in a red state and get bombarded with republicans. It makes social media almost impossible to use. I search Biden and get 30 tweets calling him a pedofile or a fake presidentThe title is a little misleading but the study is saying the exact opposite of what you’re suggesting.\s\s“ Twitter has admitted it amplifies more tweets from rightwing politicians and news outlets than content from leftwing sources.”Is there a similar research for reddit?Reddit does not really use an algorithm you mostly choose your own content by choosing subredditsIs Rose Twitter just my bubble then?>rose twitter\s\s#HOLY FUCK GO OUTSIDE\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/neoliberal) if you have any questions or concerns.*Direct [link to the study](https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/blog-twitter/official/en_us/company/2021/rml/Algorithmic-Amplification-of-Politics-on-Twitter.pdf) done in collaboration with outside researchers. Some data is published too\s\sInterestingly they lean on AdFontes ( of MediaBiasChart fame ) and AllSides as rating agencies for what constitutes left/center/rightJust like everything they complain about the whole “Twitter is biased against conservatives” narrative was projection all along.I thought Vijaya Gadde said this was completely false?Go after their ad revenue.I'm not getting burned by Rolling Stone again just because this story agrees with my priors. I don't trust Rolling Stone lmaoFor me it's not so much that it's the Rolling Stone. It's more that these types of people have shown themselves to be massively ego-centric such that it's plausible that they could be embellishing their connections with Congress just to make themselves look important. Or they could be using this as a bargaining chip with investigators.\s\sOn the other hand their claims do line up with other pieces of evidence like the suspicious ""guided tours"" and the seemingly directed Tweets on/around Jan 6 by members of Congress. I think it's reasonably established that there was coordination between Republican officials and the insurrectionists the question is just to what degree.\s\sEdit: I guess it's worth considering that all of this could be true at the same time lol.At least the photo matches the actual event this time. Progress!I have this vague sense that Rolling Stone is untrustworthy but can't remember exactly why. Which incident(s) are you referring to?[deleted]Maybe Trump will get impeached a third timeHat trickWouldn't have been necessary if they actually allowed a proper investigation...You know what they say - three strikes and yooooooooouuuuuuuu're still one of the most likely people on earth to win the 2024 election!Say it with me now ""Lock them up!""\s\sIt's insane to me that this isn't bigger news. Members of Congress actively conspired to commit a coup and it's crickets out there.Didn't this news just come out a few hours ago due to the House investigation?The Fourth Estate is too busy writing about their Twitter beefsNot really. They certainly set the *stage* for something that could become a coup but (as far as we can tell) they didn't have actual plans for violence or overthrow.They planned a legal protest. We knew this already because politicians spoke at it and they set up a stage and sound system and got permission. It's a non story.Whether it's Republicans congresspeople collaborating in an attempted coup or Democrats trying to ""lock up"" those congresspeople both sides have demonstrated a lack of respect for democracy.So the list so far includes the following Congressmen\s\s• Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)\s\s• Paul Gosar (R-AZ)\s\s• Lauren Boebert (R-CO)\s\s• Mo Brooks (R-AL)\s\s• Madison Cawthorn (R-NC)\s\s• Andy Biggs (R-AZ)\s\s• Louie Gohmert (R-TX)\s\sI may have some major disagreements with some of the left-wing congress members but they at least respect our institution unlike these individuals listed above. They need to be expelled from Congress at the very least. However with the current structure that’s unlikely so investigations and arrests need to be conducted instead. \s\sIf you happen to live in one of the district they represent then please if nothing else vote them out during the midterms next year.\s\sEDIT: This article does have a questionable source so apologies for jumping the gun however I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the above mentioned reps actively supported the insurrection at the very least.Marjorie Taylor Greene's distict is R+50.\sLauren Boebert's district is getting redrawn to be even safer for her by a Democratic-run commission.\s\sThese people aren't getting voted out ever. I could even see at least one of them being House Speaker in a decade or so due to their being as insulated and safe in their seats as Pelosi is in her San Francisco district.This comment is excessive partisanship /s[deleted]Color me shocked at that list /sWere any of these representatives also on the GOP-proposed list for the Jan. 6 commission?Expel them for what? Helping to organize a protest isn't illegal. I'd like to see these clowns get expelled from congress as much as anybody but unless there's evidence that they knew about the storming of the building beforehand they don't seem to have done anything to warrant it.Party of treason?!Is there any information about this from a credible news source?WaPoIs rolling stone not credible?>“Our impression was that it was a done deal” the organizer says “that he’d spoken to the president about it in the Oval … in a meeting about pardons and that our names came up. They were working on submitting the paperwork and getting members of the House Freedom Caucus to sign on as a show of support.” \s\s>The organizer claims the pair received “several assurances” about the “blanket pardon” from Gosar.\s\s>“I was just going over the list of pardons and we just wanted to tell you guys how much we appreciate all the hard work you’ve been doing” Gosar said according to the organizer.\s\sbruhIf these people are surprised that the pardons didn't actually happen they probably should have considered that possibility before engaging with the actual dumbest members of Congress.This should be the main headline of every news outlet tomorrow and I almost guarantee it won't be.I was telling my brother that RS published this tonight because they want it to dominate the news cycle tomorrow but that it probably won't and it probably sadly doesn't matter if it did.Even if it was I have absolutely zero confidence the public will believe it. Every damn voter in the country basically has their mind made up about what they want to believe regardless of any facts. We're in the post-truth era.It's not really that notable. Trump spoke at the event it makes sense they would have met with Meadows. \s\sAnd some random congressperson made vague hints that he could influence Trump to pardon one of the organizers for some unreleated investigation he was the subject of. There have been a lot of stories about people with no real authority peddling pardons.Joe Biden could hold an emergency conference with the media and make it a headline. He is the president of the United States and considering the last president couldn't stay the fuck out of the media it's baffling how little presence Biden has had. \s\sBut I guess the fillibuster and Sinema and Manchin are preventing him from doing that...Going to need more than Rolling Stone though. I still remember Rolling Stone running literally a fanfic regarding the UVA rape culture.This story just isn't that notable. They met with Meadows and some congresspeople before the event? Trump and other spoke there so it's not surprising that they would involve Meadows in Trump's plans for the day.\s\sThe pardon promise was just some random congressperson making vague promises to pardon one of the organizers because they're involved in some other investigation. The headline makes it sound like they offered to pardon all the insurrectionists which isn't what the article actually says.This should be higher up. Let's not become the pariah that r/politics became during the Russia investigationRollingstone has a habit of publishing highly sensational stories that end up being completely false. \s\sI’ll take this story with a grain of salt until a more credible publication picks up the story. If it is true I’ve no doubt that will be soon.Stan for Marjorie Taylor Greene all you want to. I'm pretty sure this is something everyone saw coming.Imprison Lauren Boebert[deleted]The fact that this story confirmation of a coordinated attack **with inside help** on the United States doesn't immediately go to national headlines speaks volumes as to just how fucked we really areAnd what exactly are you going to do if Democrats do nothing?\s\sNot vote Democrat? You have no power to hold them accountable.This was a coup.They're sure as fuck gonna try again in 2024 and if they take congress they'll probably pull it off this time. Real stable democracy we got here.Well it failed. \s\sBut yes it was an attempted coup.Literally a third world country.\s\sedit: So do the people downvoting think this is a normal thing that happens in developed countries or...?Congressional democrats preference for peace over justice means that nothing will come of this and it will happen again.At this point it’s clear that Trump was planning a coup and had a desire to establish a dictatorship. He needs to be tried for treason.I dont understand how this is a new development. The stop the steal rally was organized by the trump campaign as far as I know its not ilegal for staff members or congressmen to help orgnaise rallies.  The storming of the capitol is obviously ilegal but this article just says that there were staffers planning the rally which occured in the white house not that they were planning the storming. I assumed this to be true already as trump himself repeatedly advertised the rally prior to the event.If what they assert is true then the part about pardons is pretty revealing. As you said it's not illegal to plan rallies yet pardons were discussed. Why would they need to talk about blanket pardons if everything they intended to do was above board? Certainly implies they knew they were planning to do illegal things with the express consent of the administration.\s\sI'll wait until more reporting comes out as Rolling Stone has been shoddy in the past but the implications of these allegations are very bad.> “A whole host of people let this go a totally different way” the senior Republican staffer says. “They fucked it up for a lot of people who were planning to present evidence on the House floor. We were pissed off at everything that happened .”\s\sWell see the problem with that plan is they never had any evidence. Raiding the capitol didn't stop them from presenting their """"""evidence"""""" it was just shit evidence and they were actually hoping the riot would let them overturn the election.\s\sA lot of this has some plausible deniability (""Oh we were just having a little protest it all just got out of hand"" type stuff) but the pardon bits should make it clear people were trying to make it go sideways.\s\s> And Gosar who has been one of the most prominent defenders of the Jan. 6 rioters allegedly took things a step further. Both sources say he dangled the possibility of a “blanket pardon” in an unrelated ongoing investigation to encourage them to plan the protests.Nothing will happenUntil it does.I'm waiting for a better news source to carry this. Members of Congress meeting with protest organizers isn't particularly spicy. Members of Congress promising protesters pardons for criminal activities is but by the same token it is a more extravagant claim and Rolling Stone has a history of picking up extravagant claims and running with them.The article doesn't say they promised protestors pardons. It says Congressman Gosar hinted he could get a pardon for one of the organizers for an unrelated investigation he was the subject of.I’m going to call bullshit on this story. Massive conspiracy? Kept totally secret by a bunch of bozos for nearly a year after the event? Reported in Rolling Stone which has a history of shoddy journalism in an article composed entirely of allegations? Either this never happened or it’s a fish story.Just a note nowhere in the article does it say that the violence/coup-y part of 1/6 was a part of the meetings.Yeah this isn't shocking news at all. The organizers met with Meadows who's the person in charge of Trump's schedule and a bunch of congresspeople and/or their staff members. Not shocking since Trump and some congresspeople attended or spoke at the event.\s\sSome congressperson made vague promises that never materialized of ""the possibility of a “blanket pardon” in an unrelated ongoing investigation"". Fucked up yes but there's been a lot of stories about people with no real influence peddling pardons.Good they'll have to keep saying the violence part was a terrible thing.Honestly we headed for 1930s Japan where people are gonna try to coup the government and the government is gonna give them slaps on the wrist in terms of punishmentOr Germany or Italy from around the same time.\s\sSo if history is any guide here what will happen next is the moderates will work their ass off to try and bring the radicals into the fold and defang them because Manchin and Sinema (among others) will prefer to work with the authoritarian coup plotters to box out ""The Left"".\s\sBecause we know how well that worked out.If there's a shred of legitimacy in this country these traitors need to be punished to the fullest extent of the law. And they certainly shouldn't be in fucking congress!And this guy gets 44 months in federal prison:\s\shttps://twitter.com/theintercept/status/1452097061072035843\s\sHis biggest crime? ""The threat of kidnapping charge stemmed from a feverish public Facebook post in which Baker put out a general call for anti-racists and anti-fascists to encircle the state Capitol should far-right groups attack it “on or around inauguration day” and “trap” right-wingers inside with cops. In the very next sentence though he wrote “we will drive them out of Tallahassee with every caliber available!” The right wing militiae were thus to be trapped in and driven out at once on an unspecified day by an unnamed collaboration of counterprotesters.""\s\sJan 6th traitors who not only posted worse but then went to and entered the capitol are getting probation.\s\sThis country is pretty fucked.I bet they are dumb and arrogant enough to leave a paper trailI am skeptical of anonymous sources here. Everyone remover the Russia investigation. We should remain cautious because if this is true that would constitute the second largest betrayal by active members of Congress in the history of the Republic.>Despite their remaining affinity for Trump and their questions about the vote both sources say they were motivated to come forward because of their concerns about how the pro-Trump protests against the election ultimately resulted in the violent attack on the Capitol. Of course with their other legal issues and the House investigation both of these sources have clear motivation to cooperate with investigators and turn on their former allies. And both of their accounts paint them in a decidedly favorable light compared with their former allies. \s“The reason I’m talking to the committee and the reason it’s so important is that — despite Republicans refusing to participate … this commission’s all we got as far as being able to uncover the truth about what happened at the Capitol that day” the organizer says. “It’s clear that a lot of bad actors set out to cause chaos. … They made us all look like shit.” \s\s\sSo it's damned clear from the article the ""planning"" was for the rally which was legal and there's zero connection to the actual violence except a vague reference by a staffer that there were discussions about a ""blanket pardon.""  ""What would the pardon be for?""  Maybe [obstructing pedestrian traffic?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/10/20/alyssa-milano-arrested-white-house-while-advocating-freedom-vote-act/6105731001/)These characters are why I support keeping Gitmo open.LMAO wtfwe sharing conspiracy theories now?> “No one cares about Jan. 6 when gas prices are skyrocketing grocery store shelves are empty unemployment is skyrocketing businesses are going bankrupt our border is being invaded children are forced to wear masks vaccine mandates are getting workers fired and 13 members of our military are murdered by the Taliban and Americans are left stranded in Afghanistan” Dyer wrote.\s\sYeah… culture war bullshit aside most people just don’t really care about January 6. Only the nichest of the most terminally online liberals do. The public never cared about it beyond the day that it actually happened cause they were like “well the election was certified anyway so there’s not really a problem” at best and “well the liberals in Congress like Pramila Jayapal and Maxine Waters pretty much tried to do the same thing to Trump in 2017 and Barbara Boxer did it to Bush in 2001 so… meh…” at worst.\s\sI said it when it happened but Dems are going to exclusively run on Jan. 6 and domestic terrorism fearmongering due to having zero permanent accomplishments to campaign on and then are going to have surprised Pikachu faces when they lose both majorities and Joe Biden begins having to defend himself from impeachment inquiries during the next Congressional Term.>Instead he asked me what I thought Hillary’s chances were. The polls were unanimous in her winning but what he wanted to know was my own assessment?\s\s>I had to be frank with him. I did not trust the polls I said.\s\sThis sounds like rank hindsight bias right?

I mean anyone could see what a bad candidate Hillary was. We just thought Trump was going to be worse (and he was of course but his voters lived in the right states). \s\sPeople are downvoting like it's not true. She had the 2nd worst favorability of any candidate since they started doing favorability polls. She's a swell lady and would've been a good ~~candidate~~ edit: president but she was obviously a bad candidate. She lost to Donald Trump. >Other Discussions (63)\s\sWew lad And they say *we're* the shills. I wonder who the people are who upvoted this in /r/neoliberal.Impressive time-lapse on Donna Brazile’s conscience here. Her confession about the corruption she witnessed within the DNC occurs about a year and a half after the fact 10 months into Trump’s presidency and 5 days before her new book comes out. How amazingly brave of her.> Instead he asked me what I thought Hillary’s chances were. The polls were unanimous in her winning but what he wanted to know was my own assessment?\s> \s> I had to be frank with him. I did not trust the polls I said.\s\scringe.At this point I really believe that Donna's goal for whatever reason is to do as much damage to the Democratic party as possible. I dare you guys to look in the Other Discussions tabWorth it for the title in Dramano donna what is you doingtelling the truth for onceI honestly don't want to read this (will probably end up doing it some day anyway) so I want to ask: is there any evidence of *illegal* activity in this or is it just further questionable skulduggery?> I had tried to search out any other evidence of internal corruption that would show that the DNC was rigging the system to throw the primary to Hillary but I could not find any in party affairs or among the staff. I had gone department by department investigating individual conduct for evidence of skewed decisions and I was happy to see that I had found none. Then I found this agreement.\s\s> The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal but it sure looked unethical.  If the fight had been fair one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. \s\s\s\sBasically no rigging except for this joint fundraising agreement - WHICH ARE FUCKING COMMONPLACE AMONG NATIONAL PARTIES. SANDERS (PSUV - Vermont) SET ONE UP AS WELL.\s\sThe point about ""control of the party"" is also meaningless. By the time Donna took control in late July the voters *had* decided. \s\sI can link you to better E_S_S posts if you want. But short answer not even questionable skullduggery.It's as much a ""secret take over"" of the DNC as the TARP fund was a ""secret take over"" of banks.[deleted]No. \s\sHillary came in with her pantsuit freshly pressed and with money to blow and Donna had to step aside for running the organization she was in charge of into the fucking dirt Lol Clinton is the boogeyman of the far left and far right. It’s so damn stupid. She's the boogeyman of the *center* left and *center* right somehow.Personally I'm getting ready for 4 more years of trump now.she is not the boogeyman of the far left. The far left is nothing compared the far right. \s\sI just wish everyone could just say ""Clinton was a turd sandwich and can we please stop talking about her?""I don't see why this is all that big news. We knew about this before didn't we? \s\shttps://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/dnc-democratic-committee-hillary-clinton-fundraising-agreement-2016-121813\s\sState parties set the rules for primaries not the DNC. The DNC is a glorified fundraising arm and it couldn't even do that properly. HFA assumed their debt and bailed them out. \s\sIndividuals candidates also raise their own money that's where the bulk of it comes from. The DNC the DCCC the DSCC and the DGA contribute supplementary money advertising (sometimes) and manpower. \s\sHere's a breakdown of the money used from HVF. \s\shttps://www.opensecrets.org/jfc/summary.php?id=C00586537\s\sEvery state party got around $3 million and considering it is money Hillary and her campaign raised I don't see the problem here. Everyone got a good cut and while the majority of it went to the Presidential election that's not unexpected. \s\sPolitico took an excerpt from a book written by a person who wants to dodge blame and responsibility gave it a click-baity headline and presented that excerpt without any context. \s\sPeople are reading far too much into this. None of this is new information the source and the intentions of that source are questionable and if you look at the plain facts nothing here is all that strange. In shocking news Party prefers candidate who has been giving them money for years than one who joined just to run a campaign. S-H-O-C-K-I-N-G. I like Bernie in fact i support most of his ideas to an extent but his supporters are as culty as Trumps sometimes when it comes to certain things. Maybe this is just so they can feel better that they threw away votes going for a shitty third party alternative. This part is new and the most worrying part of it:\s\s> The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC Hillary would control the party’s finances strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing budgeting data analytics and mailings.\s\sIf the Clinton campaign had that much control and access since August 2015 the DNC blatantly played favorites through the entire primary while claiming to be neutral.is/ought fallacy.\s\sSo even though the people voting rejected Clinton a sane stable coherent professional educated experienced candidate it's all fine because the rules weren't broken. OMG TRUMP WON!! stop trying to say the status quo is fine. The DNC has taken a huge reputational hit from this whole fiasco. They need to change their internal structure so Top democrats don't keep coming out and[ saying the system was rigged](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/02/politics/elizabeth-warren-dnc-rigged/index.html). WTF I love Hillary now \s\sBTW it’s the secret take over that was widely reported on in 2015 and that BeRNie also participated in. Do these people fail to understand that Hillary won by four million votes and that there is nothing showing these votes were tampered with or voters were otherwise 'forced' to vote for her? Turns out that if you run as an independent in a Democratic primary the voters just aren't that in to you. . . . secret?Donna Brazile is an opportunistic hack and part of the long-standing problem with the DNC. Listen to any interview she's ever done and tell me that she says something insightful. Ironic that such a career talking-head hot-air blower like her makes this attack and we all take it so seriously.\s\sDonna Brazile is part of the corrupt buy-my-book/contribution/talking-tour-based DNC that needs to be dismantled in order to have a true liberal party.\s\sOr we can just continue following hacks and fetishizing Bernie Sanders' ridiculous long-outdated economic policies. Let's give it one more try. /s\s\s She makes the money\s\sShe makes the rules. Ignore all the personal crusading of Donna Brazile and just look at these passages:  \s\s> Individuals who had maxed out their $2700 contribution limit to the campaign could write an additional check for $353400 to the Hillary Victory Fund—that figure represented $10000 to each of the 32 states’ parties who were part of the Victory Fund agreement—$320000—and $33400 to the DNC. The money would be deposited in the states first and transferred to the DNC shortly after that. Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.  \s\s.\s\s> Yet the states kept less than half of 1 percent of the $82 million they had amassed from the extravagant fund-raisers Hillary’s campaign was holding just as Gary had described to me when he and I talked in August.  \s\s.\s\s> The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC Hillary would control the party’s finances strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing budgeting data analytics and mailings.Not completely excusing this but the states got money. The article make it sound like peanuts \s\shttps://www.opensecrets.org/jfc/summary.php?id=C00586537\s\s$2-3 million to a local party is a shitload of money. > Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.\s\sTHIS IS EXACTLY HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO WORK HOLY SHIT.\s\sBattleground states get first priority. The presidential candidate gets second priority. Non presidential non battle ground state candidates get last priority. What the hell is wrong with that???It's extra upsetting because we were within striking distance of retaking the Senate (and padding our margins against the horrible 2018 map).\s\sFlipping Pennsylvania Wisconsin and North Carolina would have been a super big fucking deal.  And while we can all argue over whether these campaigns were ""winnable"" $82M is a buncha-lotta-money.  Certainly it wouldn't have hurt chances to expand campaign staffs in these states rather than plowing everything into a Hillary Campaign and hoping her name brand alone could carry the entire party.[deleted]I'm still waiting for the article by Reince Preibus where he exposes the Trump takeover of the RNC.Wasn't Donna Brazile caught colluding with the Clinton campaign by sending questions before CNN's town hall? Tad Divine received the exact same questions and the Bernie campaign confirmed as much.It was like a question about the Flint water crisis at the Flint debate. Oh my. Hillary would have never prepped for that question without the tip-off.Yes that was prior to her joining the DNC and finding all of this. Separate issue and if you truly didn't know then there's your answer but if you did then you're trying to discredit this piece with some whataboutism. It's irrelevant on this post.[yes](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/donna-brazile-finally-admits-she-shared-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign/article/2617742)Alright guys - if you want to be evidence-based this is a pill you're going to have to swallow. The primary wasn't rigged but this is unquestionable evidence of corruption in the DNC.[deleted]Why is this unquestionable? Bernie was offered the same deal.I don't know about that. The DNC was in a huge amount of debt and unable to raise funds on their own. Hillary paid off the debt and helped fundraise for them.\s\sBernie also wasn't interested in DNC funds or his own Bernie Victory Fund which only raised $1000. He relied on small donations totally and said they weren't interested in using the Victory Fund if they won the primary.\s\sThe only thing this hurts is the perception and non competitive states which didn't keep their money - swing States kept their money.Have fun losing Democrats. God what a stupid party sometimes\s\sWorst thing this is after corbyn lost.We followed the UK down the path of nationalism in 2016 so hey why not have our own Corbynite smackdown in 2020.\s\sRelentless online propaganda works.(Correct me if I’m wrong) but the main reason Corbyn lost was that Brexit split his Coalition. Does Bernie have a similar issue besides just general Socialism. Also I think it’s just as valid to look across the Southern Border to Mexico and the election of AMLO when trying to predict what will happen in the U.S.UK demographics and U.S. demographics are different. Quit comparing the political situation of these two countries moron.Fans of bad sports teams also think their team can win more than it will. This is not unique to Bernie and is just a motivated reasoning thing.As a life long Democrat and Minnesota Vikings fan can fucking confirm!72% of democratic voters are dumb and wrongThis party is just throwing itself into the meat grinder.72% of democratic voters are smart. Neoliberals who think Bernie will lose are dumb.If all 72% of these democrats did vote....then?We have to change this. I trust Bloomberg to tank his polling with a giant negative campaign targeted at Sanders post-debate.the GOP is a mistakeName and shame the cowardsThe only positive about Trump is that he's accelerating the GOP's death spiral.See that's what I'd love to think too but there's no indication that the GOP is dying. It's been getting slowly radicalized since the 70s and people are always saying ""this has to stop or backfire at some point"" but it never has yet.\s\sThe most likely outcome right now is that Trumpism (cult-like hatred for anything liberal and support for whoever they see as their leader) simply continues to be the norm for the next 50 years.I think she actually has a pretty good shot mainly because Trump is laser focused on destroying Kemp currently.Yes one of his few good qualities.  He'll happily train friendly fire on any Republican who hasn't guzzled their full dose of Kool-aid.Trump is already publicly [shitting](https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1466194323494555650?t=qIL7S59eNuVg--UN-U89yQ&s=19) on him so you may have a point.Hopefully she will also help enough down ballot to give Warnock a second term.Agreed. And because this is a statewide race the redistricting nonsense happening in red states across the country (including Georgia) don't matter.    \s\s\sI do fear voting restrictions and efforts to close polling places in heavily democratic districts is going to make this an unfair fight — but if anyone can succeed despite these barriers it's Stacey Abrams.Call me too optimistic but I think she has a pretty good shot at this one. I know it’s a “republican year” or whatever but Dems have been continuously flipping munincipal seats even as recently as a day ago (flipped like 7 in runoff elections). Combine this with how good Abrams has been at getting out the vote it is well possible for her to win (not to mention how much trump **hates** kemp if he survives a primary Trumpers will still possibly be sour on him)In recent years I've discovered that I have all the political prediction prowess of a triggered Twitter tankie; I have no idea how her campaign will go but godspeed.  Abrams is a firebrand but more importantly than that she's a firewall anyone who keeps a Republican out of office is a good deal. \s \sAlmost everything else < WinningThe big problem nationwide for Democrats in 2022 will be matching Republican enthusiasm to vote against Biden.  Stacey has created a huge nationwide following since 2018 and is one of the rare politicians that gets people *excited* to vote for them.  If she can get a huge minority turnout while also already having Warnock on the ballot I can’t see how 2022 won’t be another blue year in Georgia.That’s a great point. Stacey gets people *excited*. \s\sBefore the lockdown days she came to a local Democratic Party event in Phoenix (Arizona is purple now but it felt redder then) and people were lining up to take pictures with her and shake her hand. I don’t remember what the meeting was even about but the crowd was cheering and giving standing ovations the entire time. The enthusiasm was incredible. It’s rare to see a candidate who can do that to people.\s\sEdit: She wasn’t even running for anything at the time and she was from the opposite side of the country! She just does something to peopleMy big fear is you actually need Trump being an active bull in china shop to motivate people to vote... period and that the motivation to vote blue in any other scenario has already been thoroughly diminished by efforts of the disgruntled left. \s\sBecause Republicans? They're chomping at the bit all the time now that they're sufficiently deranged.beto gets me excited over here in Texas though I fear that he gets Republicans excited too :(Stacey might get the *wrong people* excited. Warren and KHive types that ensconce the campaign in a bubble where they can do no wrong everything is someone else’s fault and drive their candidate to say stupid things.It's interesting. Municipal results here in GA have seemed to continue swinging Dem even as the country as a whole is in a Republican mood. We just flipped like 7 seats yesterday for a total of like 40 something net flips since 2020. This may not be as doomed as it may look at first glance. I don't know how true it really is but I've believed that GA is a relatively inelastic state (for a few reasons) and that once we flip there won't be much going back. If anyone can do it it'll be Stacey even if I hold a less positive opinion of her than many people do (not conceding elections is not cool regardless of party).Care to share your reasons why you think GA is inelastic? Just the growth of Atlanta?\s\sIt doesn't sound implausible to me; I'd just like to hear your thoughts on why.I think the last presidential election probably encouraged a lot of people who are democrat-inclined but thought voting blue in GA was a lost cause.Do you think that not conceding elections continues to not be cool even when the election was not free or fair? Not saying this was or wasn’t the case for Georgia but that is why Abrams didn’t concede.So we should concede that Maduro won fairly in Venezuela or Ortega in Nicaragua?\s\sNot conceding elections is not cool when they're fairWell best of luck to her.  I expect that she's in a structurally disadvantageous position at least in contesting an election against an incumbent but maybe her aptitude for political organizing and the occasional self-destructive habits of the Republican Party will see her through to victory.  Even a credible loss might be worth something.  The Democratic Party certainly would do well to 'claim new territory' as it were and Georgia seems relatively ripe for that.Remember that with the Republican gubernatorial candidate — it will either be Brian Kemp who is *deeply* unpopular with the deplorables or a MAGA crazy who won’t enthral high-turnout voters in the Atlanta suburbs.\s\sThere’s no room for a Glenn Youngkin-type candidate this time around if that accounts for anythingIt’ll be interesting to see Democrat success in Georgia will continue in a likely Republican swing year. If anyone can do it though it would be AbramsAt this point I'm not at all sure Kemp will even win the primary.\s\sHeh peach pun.> Even a credible loss might be worth something.\s\sdon't forget the significant and likely positive impact this will have on down ballot races in swing districtsShe should run for president in 24.Hope she wins!## Q U E E Nfuture president🎉 H Y P E 🎉yay!Excited to vote for her in my first electionWhy is this your first??SO BASED\s\sLike probably my favorite Dem in the country right nowI think you meant to post this in the Delaney thread.QUEEN IN THE SOUTH 👑👑👑👑SinemaThe chad Abrams gubernatorial campaign vs the virgin O'Rourke gubernatorial campaignIn reality both have embraced similar strategies that have paid off in terms of boosting Democratic support in the stateHell yeah. If she can pull this off it will be one of the great political comebacks of all time. Runs for Governor in 2018 and loses a tight race in the faces of major structural impediments placed by a long entrenched GOP. Refocuses her efforts on opening up the state to Dems. Helps deliver GA to Biden and ***two*** Senate seats to knock McConnell out of the Mjority Leader position he had counted on to subvert Biden’s Presidency. Now she’s coming back for the Governor’s mansion to tie things up.Never gonna happen. They didn’t like her in 2018 and they’re not gonna like her in 2022. She still hasn’t accepted her defeat from 2018.Great news. Really good news for the Senate as well.Go Stacey!👸🏿👸🏿👸🏿I really hope she runs for President one dayI think southern dems are starting to tilt more towards a religous conservative image for their black base. Which is incredibly based 😎😎😎🤢 if that's what it takes to win an election but I could never call social conservatism basedthe queen has arrivedGodspeedI look forward to voting for her for president one day!Send your downvotes my way as a georgian I still can't get passed the logistical issues of running a candidate who lost in 2018 against the same candidate she lost to. She did refuse to concede and it wasn't a good look. Of course I'll vote for her and I think she'll be an excellent governor. But I'm just not sure what's changed. 🤷‍♂️She doesn't have a shot. The gop has spent like the last year and a half demonizing her and now everyone knows who she is.Will the fact that both U.S. Senators in GA are now Dems actually work against her?  Something something ""balanced government"" something...Well keep in mind Dems have been flipping a ton of municipal seats in GA this year though obv the governors race is differentThat argument was used to try to prevent those Senators from being elected in the first place with the “divided government good” talking point — so I don’t think that would have any particular salience in this cycle when it’s less apparentI will never understand that logic.

That’s what $58000? \s\sThat’s pennies.The article points out what the actual issue is if you cared to bother to read bother to read it.I thought succs were all for universal programs 🧐I still remember the bitching about the income thresholds on stimulus checks.The real issue is how someone like George Soros who was named in the article could use the tax system to make it appear that they only had 124000 in income to the IRS.Oh no!  .0000001% checks were sent incorrectlyTell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article.So what?People with less than $150000 in 2019 income got checks that went out to everyone with less than $150000 in 2019 income. \s\sShocker.The problem is that the tax system sees them as having less than 129000 a year despite being billionaires.Clearly we should spend far more than $60000 in administrative costs to ensure that the government doesn’t spend $60000 in *that* manner. Of all the things that the government spends $60000 this is what this article decided to talk about.Didn't literally every American get some of the stimulus checks? I know I did I bought a new TV.I didnt .  Not one.  I wont vote for any of the scum that voted for the cares act either.  These UBI tax credits are divisive as hell.Based those people work very hard.Okay. I was told by the lefties that limiting who gets stimulus checks was a bad thing though.  Remember that?  Income thresholds bad.  I recall some even saying what's the big deal if Bill Gates got one.  Okay so now it's a big deal?I don’t want to sound callous but is this a big deal?

That’s about 4000 people out of nearly half a million employees in municipal police departments and sheriff’s offices nationwide.

There maybe actually enough employees but if most police officers flee the areas where they are needed most you basically get the same result. More crime against people who really need LEOs the most.Is this net though? There could be an uptick in the number of officers leaving the force and it’s just offset by increased hiringI wonder if large city cops migrating to the suburban areas is a significant number.

Probably makes sense for those enforcing the laws to know them.I'm pretty sure states require this already to pass police academys.Police don't enforce laws. Courts and sheriffs enforce laws. Police intervene in ongoing crimes and arrest suspected criminalsDoesn't it get brought up from time to time that policing is a specific degree- requiring job in Scandinavia? I guess this would be sort of the quicker way to a similar result. I'm in.I'm curious to hear this sub's thoughts on this considering the general perception of occupational licensing here.I think it's misguided. Will give them more bargaining power rather than less.I don't get it who do they think will fill those vacancies?""Never waste a good crisis"" <sigh>just follow the law lolDefund news outlets that write up articles on individual polls ([that are also outliers](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo)).True but his popularity is consistently low.\s\sHis approval rating is the lowest in modern history.40% of the soldiers were Republican/Libertarian 44% were independents and 16% were Democrats. 43% say they'll vote for Biden and only 37% will for Trump. Soldiers are typically a Republican stronghold and part of Trump's base. 52% dislike Obama.[deleted]lol at “Libertarian” military members. Most of the people I knew in the military call themselves libertarian now too and many of those work in nuclear power which is heavily subsidized.[deleted]What branch are you from?\s\sAnecdotally I seem to recall a lot of Navy redditors being incredibly pissed off at the way that CAPT Crozier was treated by the acting SECNAV and the whole debacle of how he was removed and reassigned.Do you think Mattis has anything to do with this shift? I know a handful of former Marines and they all have a deep respect for him.  When he was chosen at the outset that seemed to give a lot of them comfort. I haven’t been able to chat with them recently but I’d have to wager that Mattis’ strong rebuke of Trump _must_ impacted their opinions.Thank you for your service.As someone enlisted Army \s\sIt baffles me why anyone supports Trump. He doesn’t care about us. We’re just props. \s\sHe said he would take care of veterans and military families. But the facts speak for themselves. 35000 military families on food stamps. 22 veterans suicides every single day 45000 homeless veterans on the Nations street. \s\sInstead of Filling the 50000 vacancies at the VA he’s tried to privatize the whole system. I could go on\s\sOh yeah Also he’s a draft dodger. Remember when Republicans attacked Bill Clinton over that?You’re conflating reality with identity. A lot of these folks don’t care that R presidents routinely treat military members like actual crap because they wrap themselves with the flag and that hoo-rah BS gets people motivated a lot more than meaningful change like properly overseeing and funding the VA. \s\s23 years enlisted myself. A good chunk of the military is full of Ron Swansons who fancy themselves fiercely independent tough guys but in reality are totally dependent on the govt for their livelihoods and careers. That group of folks seems to be drawn to Trump because he talks their talk and says the things that they think. Also there is still a fair bit of racism and certainly sexism in parts of the military and my experience has been that the areas where that stuff is allowed to exist tends to be a bastion of support as well. \s\sThe office corps is generally better educated and thinks for themselves a little bit more and seems to be more evenly divided.\s\sOne thing is though that the military skews pretty young so it will be interesting to see what a difference this admin will make on younger folks whose peer group is like 80-20 negative towards Trump as they rise through the ranks.>Oh yeah Also he’s a draft dodger. Remember when Republicans attacked Bill Clinton over that?\s\sIt’s even worse IMO because Clinton didn’t use family connections or phony medical ailments to avoid Vietnam he had a scholarship to study at Oxford.>Also he’s a draft dodger. Remember when Republicans attacked Bill Clinton over that?\s\sI can't remember the circumstances with Clinton but I don't think it involved wealth and influence or ridiculous meidcal claims like bunions or whatever Trump used.  Motivation was different too.  Clinton was against the war.  Trump was against a rich important boy like himself having to be inconvenienced.His supporters were claiming he had given the military the largest pay increase ever just after his election.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThey still haven't gotten as large a pay bump as the first two they received under Obama.The VA is pretty fucking expensive and terrible. \s\sPut all veterans on medicaid. That system works better and is less expensive per person.This is particularly bad for Trump as in 2016 he was +33 in the same poll and Romney was +40 in 2012. If this is what we’re seeing he’s screwed.\s\sHowever if he’s seeing these numbers internally too that’s only another reason for him to call mail-in voting fraudI wonder if his attacks on mail in voting will lead to Democrats voting more in person and not trusting mail in voting?That's great but you know how deployed military generally votes? By mail.Do you know how many military members utilize the FVAP? Not many.The Military Times polls are a joke though. They poll their subscribers and as one can imagine the population of the people who actually bother to spend money on a subscription for it is different than the general active duty population.Perhaps. There's still a major shift compared to their prior polls.This bodes very well for the military being on Biden's side if Trump refuses to leave. Especially officers being trump's strongest opposition.He can't refuse to leave the office. He can only refuse to leave the building. In which case it's a matter for the police. The military will not recognize him as C in C unless he is inaugurated as the next President. If the election isn't confirmed by the Congress he ain't the President.Firstly I doubt this poll is accurate.  \s\sSecondly Tsk so many bad understandings of military culture and shit theories trying to push this subs preconceived notions of who votes blue or red in our society wrt education and income.\s\sThe AF is the most conservative branch even though it's one of the sMaRTesT  In fact the most conservative identifying branches are the AF and the USMC.  Officers are more likely to be registered as republicans than Enlisted.  And the younger cohorts of soldiers are more likely to be blue.  \s\sIn fact despite this one poll and the apparent belief of the comments for a long time officers were more likely to identify with a specific party and be partisan and of those two parties more likely to be red.\s\sService Members are also more likely to vote compared to their age demographic which is why you tend to see such high third party totals.Do you have a source for the AF being the most conservative?BaaaaasedThe pollster is very funky in 2016 they showed Johnson ahead of Clinton which was clearly absurd even for the active duty military vote.Trump lost so much respect from the army when he fired Mattis. The comments were flooded with veterans and people enlisted when he did that.Mattis was a marine corps general not army and he left in his own in protest after Trump abandoned the Kurds. You are right though a lot of vets were upset about it after Trump started talking shit about him afterwards.Now the tent has a camouflage wing!As an officer in the AF most of my friends in engineering/space/intel are all pretty liberal. \s\sIn my experience the rated community skews a LOT more conservative especially any platform in ACC (fighters)  AFSOC (spec ops) or Global Strike Command (bombers).> The Palestinian issue is not complicated and it is not difficult to see who is in the wrong in the debate about it.\s\sWell this makes it easy to see that the author doesn't really know what they're talking about. Calling Israel/Palestine ""simple"" is naïve at best and terminally biased at worst.how is it not an apartheid state where they literally just passed a law making arabs second class citizens? how is it not a theocracy? how is the gaza strip not a gigantic open air prison? how do you find it remotely plausible that hamas is ""tricking"" obviously desperate people into throwing rocks and getting their skulls spilt by idf snipers? what insane argument do you have to justify israeli settlements that blatantly violate international law?  how is the netanyahu and likud party not extremely right wing corrupt racist and cruel? Terrible article. All sorts of polices framed as empowering the weak have the opposite effect. Rent control NIMBYism protectionism pacifism ""small town values"" etc. Wait.

That wasn’t necessarily because they weren’t working. It was mainly because it was so difficult to satisfy all the reporting requirements.\s\s> Which is a feature not a bug of work requirements. By forcing recipients to prove they’re working and navigate a bureaucratic maze to stay in the program the state gives itself an excuse to kick off those who make a paperwork mistake or miss a reporting deadline.\s\s\s#\s\s\s> Biden’s reversal began just after he took office. In February the administration informed states that it was preparing to withdraw approvals for work requirements granted under Trump.\s\s#\s\s> This legacy is being erased in another way. Under Biden the same ACA that Trump tried to destroy is expanding and moving toward realizing its potential. A record number of more than 13 million people have signed up for 2022 coverage on the exchanges.\s\s> A key reason for this is that the covid-19 rescue plan that Biden signed in March expanded the number of people eligible for ACA subsidies and beefed up subsidies for those already eligible. As Margot Sanger-Katz details in the New York Times this is a real achievement: It substantially reimagines and expands the ACA amid a pandemic meaning the ACA is rising to an emergency occasion.\s\sFull archive link: https://archive.ph/GGgi2It almost like joe Biden is a good president 🤔Why would anyone give a shit about that when it doesn't personally benefit me a white upper-middle-class college student? Clearly Biden hasn't done anything that *actually* matters. Both Sides.He should start loudly erasing Trump's legacies.That’ll just pick a fight with Republicans making it harder to accomplish and galvanizing Republican voters.It’s infrastructure week again already?\s\sBiden’s already had at least twice as many as Trump hadHold on a minute Jack you think it’s just one infrastructure week? 💎🍦It’s infrastructure year!>Increased surveillance by the IRS to audit high-income people. Financial institutions are required to report income from their investments and business activities in a manner similar to that made for employees. This should bring in $700 billion per year.\s\sWHAT. Is it really that much? I am a little incredulous it will bring in that much but even if it brings in half of that that feels like a no brainer.It also seems like maybe it should fill some prison cells ...Doesn’t Robert Mercer alone owe something crazy like 10 billon?Good job.Is Biden a secret succ?Always has been.Idk. I'm ok with this one because a more educated population benefits corporations and helps them stay competitive globally. So in a sense the taxes are being reinvested right back into them.What's a trillion here another trillion there?\s\sAt the rate the government is spending they may as well be printing out money on toilet paper...that's all it's going to be worth after the inevitable inflation.God we should be so lucky to get a little inflation going.But they aren't printing money for this?\s\sThis is coming out of tax revenue.Look at Japan. They owe 237% of their GDP and have owed more than 100% since the 90s. Their economy is doing perfectly fine (besides demographic problems that in no way are related to the debt).You missed the part where he literally plans to pay for this with tax money but ok.A little inflation is good actually it lowers the burden of debt and signals a robust economy. The feds are targeting 2.6% and they'll likely fail to even get that high. In 2010 they made the same target and came in under.Based bidenI was wondering what neoliberals opinions would be on the growing trade deficit under Trump?  \s\sI think most on this sub would agree that deficits aren't all bad and is the result of optimal trading that economically benefits the consumer and supplier populations.  \s\sObviously like many of Trump's own practices he didn't deliver but would you guys consider this a positive result during his tenure.And Pelosi should have her signature on it.I sadly doubt it'll end up passing.I'm hopeful.Gotta throw mail-in voting into this one plsPlease please pass\^Yeah but the gop are the real progressives cause they offered 1200 first mkay. You filthy neoliberals! \s\s/sOutflankedWhaddya mean?I don't need or want this money. \s\sGive it to someone else plsGive it to charity then claim it on your taxes next yearspend it.What's the reasoning for this package? I understand that people who lost their income already got additional benefits. \s\sIs it to fill the gaps for people who don't get unemployment benefits?For what falls through the cracks; keep consumer spending up and the economy from contracting too much.The entire Federal government spends around $370B/mo. This plan would cost $440B/mo. \s\sWe’re talking about more than doubling the size of the government overnight.\s\sAnd for what? Anyone who has kept their job doesn’t really need it. Anyone who last their job and makes under $50-$60k/yr is making more now than they did working. Who are we trying to protect with these *trillions* a year in payments?\s\sThe cost of doing this for 6 months would be similar to that of offering free college tuition for the next 30 years.I mean it's not like finding the money is actually a problem. We already funded CARES and money printer go brrr. \s\sAs far as who we're trying to protect - unemployment just spiked the stock market took a dive and GDP is contracting. So everyone? \s\sA lot of people are saying that the fundamentals of the economy are sound that everything will rebound quickly (relative to other contractions) because there was nothing fundamentally wrong in the first place.\s\sThere may be some merit to this but it is far far easier to destroy something than it is to build it. The economic impact of Coronavirus will be felt for a long time.\s\sBetween now and the country reopening how many are going to struggle and how many businesses are going to buckle and fail?I would rather expand the UI bonuses and eligibility furtherBy the same amount of money?Realistically I think the Justice Department will be very hesitant to dredge up the Kavanaugh issue again. An investigation should have occurred before Kavanaugh was confirmed and DOJ might quietly review their previous review but there are very legitimate concerns about partisan attacks on the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the FBI and I'm skeptical there will be evidence or political will for a SCOTUS impeachment considering the potential long-lasting consequences of that for Democrats.\s\sI don't disagree with reviews and I understand that there are concerns about Chris Wray which given his response to questions about the Capitol riot are legitimate but the issue should be approached cautiously. More upheaval in leadership would likely not be helpful unless absolutely necessary.The rape issue is not worth bringing up again due to the political implications but I want to know about his debts cleared.>  considering the potential long-lasting consequences of that for Democrats.\s\sToo be fair democrats aren't the best putting that into their calculations. \s\s*looks at Harry Reid*Curious about the endgame here. Seems like there are a long list of pipe dreams for a 50-50 senate queued up before impeaching Justice Boof. You’ve got a better shot of changing the balance of the Supreme Court by packing it than this.Really? Because I think Manchin can sell outting cap'n boof easier than packing.Bet it’s Feinstein.[deleted]Who cares? What could it possibly show that would make any difference to anythingA lot actually. If a background check was faked by the FBI in relation to getting someone onto the Supreme Court that's extremely dishonest and a clear example of not just flouting the rules but breaking them. If this did indeed happen then the Senate can open hearings if its determined that Kavanaugh knew about the fake check that is grounds for impeachment and removal from the Supreme Court.Aside from what everyone else has said about Kavanaugh himself the importance of determining whether federal law enforcement officers were used and acted as political tools is of huge importance.Hmm go figure!Good idea.  That’s one of several thousand “Trump” things that need to be looked at in a non-partisan fashion.This is like the definition of populism. WTF I love populism nowWhile 70% is even absurdly high for a social democrat like me. The rising inequality and rampant protection of the rich in the us by the republicans was bound to get a huge backlashIt's taxation NIMBYism. No wonder the succs love itAnd rightfully so. A 70% rate is well supported by Piketty and Saez.Let's not pretend that Piketty and Saez represent the majority of experts on the topic. A 70% rate isn't ""definitely won't work and all economists oppose it"" but it is ""probably won't work and a majority of economists oppose it"".\s\sIt is also worth distinguishing what a 70% marginal tax rate actually means. A 70% federal income tax would combine  with state and local taxes to reach ~90%. That's going to have a very different effect on behavior than a federal income tax set to combine with state and local taxes to reach 70% overall.\s\sGiven the uncertainty of the optimal highest marginal tax rate the best way to implement it is gradually raising it.poll: a majority of Americans support shitty policy\s\sno surprise though\s[deleted]This is not socialism what the fuckRising inequality and decades long wage stagnation are real problems that need to be solved. Also it is really disingenuous to imply that calling for high marginal tax rates are the same thing as the what happened in the Warsaw Pact. You can debate these things without being hyperbolic. There are free market democratic countries with high tax burdens. I doubt he resigns but this is almost certainly his last term in any public office. Wild to see him go from future presidential candidate to a complete pariah in the party.I'm genuinely having trouble gauging how big this news will be. The right will obviously run with it to some extent but that doesn't really matter at all for a New York politician. \s\sI doubt he will run again and I personally found the presentation fairly compelling but I'm not sure if there is a large audience for this scandal at this stage.Does he get impeached or recalled or whatever?He was always a non-starter as presidential candidate.Like Michael Avenatti lulzHe was a future presidential candidate for about 10 minutes last April when the chattering classes needed a Man of Action to be horny about and Fauci didn’t have a brother who hosted a show on CNN.This is not wild for US partisan politics especially with DNP politics.I think more than just last term in office this should be jail time 100% IMO. I mean probably not actually cause the law is really lenient on sex pests but it *should*.So he's like Bill Clinton but without the presidency.Really you give the American public too much credit weren't the two candidates in the last Presidential election accused of sexual harassment and Clinton back in the day got a second term even with the stuff he was accused of. Isn't the governor of California an admitted adulterer the last President and the current Vice-President also. Those moral issues are no longer disqualifiers in American politics.Dudes been pretty obstinate about this. Id be surprised if he resigns. Any chance the state dems force him to?I’m guessing he’ll announce he’s not running again and they’ll call it a day.Only situation I see is a far left and Republican coalition to remove him. He’s still the king maker in NYS politics even despite his fall from grace. I would be surprised to see many moderate dems cross him on the level of an impeachmentThey have done barely anything because of covidAt bare minimum I doubt he's able to clear the field before the primary next year. Traditionally it's been Cuomo vs some leftwing nobody. At bare minimum I expect some other people to be less scared about throwing their hats into the ring. That might be enough to prevent him from seeking another term.Remember when people wanted to draft this guy to replace Biden lmaoNo one apart from some political Twitter junkies wanted that.Briefly but as soon as I heard he tried to hide his reports for covid I hated him. Biden wasn’t perfect either but he is doing better then him[removed]RIP BOZO 😎SMOKING THAT CUOMO PACKheck off and resign we don't need a Diet Matt Gaetz in the partyYou don’t know anything about Andrew cuomo if you think he’s gonna resign.

Only took a decade.Eh. It’s not it being outside of NY it’s a new era where shit like this isn’t tolerated by the public or the officials anymore. Things have changed. \s\sI doubt there are still protections in place for the victims though. Then complaining will likely still cost them work.This man released a book about himself in the middle of the pandemic lmao. And now he’s a disgraced piece of shit.\s\sHe should absolutely resign though I doubt he will unfortunately.Does this change anything? When the accusations were first being reported on the women accusing him of sexual harassment were clearly credible and even just at face value it wasn’t that outlandish to imagine the guy who often acts like such a dickhead out in the open is the same way behind closed doors.\s\s[This is exactly who Cuomo is](https://nypost.com/2021/02/17/cuomo-threat-to-dem-you-havent-seen-my-wrath-you-will-be-destroyed/) much like Trump he thinks of himself as some kind of suave mobster. To be fair those two have each attained a level of power that has only reinforced their behavior (being born to very wealthy and powerful fathers helped set the stage of course) but ultimately the guy is a textbook bully. Simple asShuts up people who said ""wait and see the outcome of the investigation"".We needed him briefly during covid but there is no reason to not impeach and remove himCuomo is beyond Trump because of walking the misogynist walk versus mostly talking it on Trump's part. Cuomo's and President Biden's power to wield in sex harassment and assault is also United States voter power and not United States dollar power. One is prostitution the other is usurpery.Andrew Yang Gubernatorial run pending😑🔫Lock Him Up.Finally.

0,AmericanPolitics,Destiny,132,"no shit sherlocksurprised pikachu[deleted][http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope\_economic\_consequences\_of\_major\_tax\_cuts\_published.pdf](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf)  \sAll you  have to do is google the name of the people in the article my dude.I learned from destiny that usually you get the gist of it by just reading the headline.shock.horror.surprise.[deleted][deleted][deleted]I'd also like to add that his argument about voter suppression having low impact is weird in a couple of ways.\s\s1) It's a really difficult thing to evaluate and is highly dependent on a number of factors.\s\s2) It's not about stopping those truly dedicated voters it's about making it enough of a pain that for people either forget or have aren't willing to go through too much of an inconvenience (it's a sad reality that not everyone understand how much voting truly matters but that much means the process should be as simple and easy as possible).\s\s3) If there were truly little to no effects why would republicans be putting so much effort and political capital into it? It's for the same reason it's self evident a company who is paying someone for advertisement (hello gambling streams) is getting a good ROI.\s\s4) Even if some of these are declared unconstitutional it won't matter if they manage to affect an election it's happened before and there's little in the way of punishment for those people.\s\s5) Simple slippery slope doing this makes it easier to erode more in the future in small increments where it's hard to argue how much a day loss here and there matters.These arguments are pretty easily countered. And to be clear I'm not saying this legislation is okay. I think normatively that everyone should be able to easily vote regardless of the partisan impact. But the evidence does not show this as having a major partisan impact. Also I should make it clear that destiny is completely wrong about gerrymandering which unlike voter suppression has a massive partisan effect on elections (about 6 points in 2012).\s  \s  \s   \s The most marginal voters are non-college white voters which are the vast majority of trump's base.\s\sThere's tons of examples of this but a particularly clear one is the GA runoffs.\s\sIn 2008 the Democratic base was far more reliant on non-college voters and the GA runoff was R+15 after the first election was R+3. \s\sIn 2020 the runoffs went from R+2 to D+1 due to the Republicans being much more reliant on non college voters who don't turn out as often.\s\s\s\shttps://twitter.com/lxeagle17/status/1408842488408801280?s=19\s\sHere's another example. Non-college turnout goes significantly down in midterms. If the coalitions were the same now as they were in 2010 the Republican landslide turns into an even fight. \s\s\sStudies also found that voting expansion doesnt lead to a partisan gain.\s\shttps://twitter.com/hill_charlotte/status/1404462614780866562\s\s\s\s\s1: Anything related to elections is but that doesn't prevent us from coming to a conclusion with a reasonable level of confidence. \s\s2: The GOP has the most low propensity voters so these measures are just as likely to hurt their own voters.\s\s3: Politicians (and especially Republicans) are not perfectly rational. They're doing it to appease their base who are very mad because they think the election was stolen.\s\s4: This is away from the core argument and I don't think this will effect an election anyway.\s\s\s5:  Sure which is why I think these laws are bad. That doesn't mean there's a partisan effect though.> 3) If there were truly little to no effects why would republicans be putting so much effort and political capital into it? It's for the same reason it's self evident a company who is paying someone for advertisement (hello gambling streams) is getting a good ROI.\s\sI mean it can have barely noticeable effect and still be #1 priority in swing states or just in elections that tend to be decided by few dozens of votes. And the best part about it is that it might not even cost them that much political capital if any as long as they frame it as ""securing the election so that daddy Trump doesn't lose next time"".But talking about current events would take more time and effort than shitting on Twitter all day to quote our dear friends Michael from PA or something like that.I think he's been getting in the swing of it again relatively speaking but yeah twitter has been cancer for the content.Yeah I was kinda surprised to hear him say in his conversation with Pakman that Democrats are trying to rig the election process and that voter suppression by Republicans is an overblown issue. It's something I'd also like to hear him elaborate on.Oh right that's something I forgot to mention in my points to me it's insane to pretend that the democrats are trying to rig the process in their favor.\s\sThe comparaison I'd use is thinking that trying to fix a balance with a rock stuck to the bottom of one side is unfair because you're changing the system to win. Yeah no shit you're trying to make it fair and you know that it being fair is gonna make it easier for you to win.\s\sInnuendos Studios [has a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAbab8aP4_A) about the insanity of going high when the opponent goes low.Which video is that?I read a while back that the effect is minimal on turnout stopping fraud and suppression. In the end there is no real need to put barriers up so it's really weird to hyper focus on them when the people they clearly affect the poor and elderly. It's all kind of pandering to respective bases but there's no real good reason for the Republican billsYeah how about he debates me about ethnostates instead?\s\spros: godlike content.\s\scons: as unproductive as talking about online trans shit.[](/SoDoge)[It's](https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/783397272394600450) [fucking](https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/783400062370123777) [nothing](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/04/guccifer-2-0-claims-to-have-hacked-clinton-foundation/)It's being suggested in the comments that this post is below the standard previously set by Guccifer 2.0 and that the blog may currently be under someone else's control. I haven't been following this shit so maybe it's just a meme.[deleted]This was my read too. Obviously the rally/protest where Trump spoke was planned. He didn’t spontaneously appear nor did the crowds. But I didn’t lead anything that said the storming of the Capitol was planned. I think this is a pretty shitty headline/photo combination for rolling stone to use.My response would be why would Gosar dangle pardons if there wasnt something nefarious intended by the ""protest""\s\sEdit: also why in the hell would Mo Brooks (a congressman) feel the need to wear body armor at his own rally???To be clear this is new. At the time those statements were made there was absolutely no evidence of these meetings happening. There was no reason to believe that was the case until today really. Additionally all we have now is just two anonymous sources which is not nothing but not at all proof.\s\sWould be fucking crazy if all they're telling is true though. Sitting Congressman dangling pardons direct line of communication to the president's team and all sorts of other awful shit.[deleted]>To be clear this is new. At the time those statements were made there was absolutely no evidence of these meetings happening. There was no reason to believe that was the case until today really.\s\sThats not true at all. There were plenty of articles about these things well before this going back to how Trump was trying to get Pence on board. Woodward's book even cites some of these meetings.Bullshit. Stop playing simp for Steven. I'm sick of the ignorance of people here when it comes to calling Jan 6th an insurrection and properly classifying it. It was a coup attempt planned and motivated. For years militia groups have been waiting for this moment. Just because they failed doesn't mean it wasn't a coup attempt. It also doesn't mean the threat is gone.I'm pretty I saw a video on a politician telling people in a crowd that he was going to leave some door openhttps://twitter.com/funder/status/1452464537869897728And there was absolutely no evidence that it wasn't conspired lol\s\sEdit: downvotes are funny. If you have no evidence for either case you should just not talk about it. Destiny said he think insurrection is a harsh word. It isn't. They tried to overturn the election.I'm pretty sure he was talking about the mass of people having a plan. Not a few groups or individuals. Also I would would wait until this investigation is finished.Yea it seems pretty clear that some people in the crowd (Proud Boys) were trying to escalate the situation intentionally. I think what Destiny is referring to as the majority of attendees.OP I have a question on a scale of 1 to 10 how awful would you say Jan 6th was? We'll see McDonald's ice cream machine broken is a 1 and 9/11 is a 10.Well alot of people may disagree but we are talking about domestic terrorists violence with a political motive....the only people that were killed as a direct result were the terrorists I believe one person got trampled and the other was shot in the capitol but I could be wrong about the first instance thats less deaths than 9/11 but still technically a terrorist attack..Id say a 9\s\sEdit: I gave alot of weight to my belief that the actions of the people on Jan 6th constitutes an attempt to take control of the government. There have been more deadly domestic terrorist attacks...oklahoma city bombing...but this was worse because it couldve ended with a bunch of militias having control of our capitol with congress people as hostagesPlan to protest? Sure\s\sPlan to break shit up? Maybe\s\sPlan to storm the capitol? Definitely not\s\sPlan to take over control? You can only really atribute that to trumpBullshit. But keep sucking daddy Steves dick all you want. \s\sI get it right now this community is on the lefty arc still but the right and its militia groups almost overturned an election and installed a monarchy. Fuck outta here with this shit. \s\sPlan to protest? YES\s\sPlan to break shit up? YES\s\sPlan to storm the capitol? YES listen to the speakers before Trump and to the rhetoric from his henchmen going on since he lost the election\s\sPlan to take over control? YES. Militias have been waiting for this moment for years. The only question is was this the actual attempt and they failed or was it merely a practice run? \s\sI'm sick of you fuckers acting like it wasn't a big deal.Seems like a big load of nothing\s\sOf course there was planning between the politicians attending a protest planned in advance that the president spoke at.\s\sTaking that and suggesting that because they helped plan the legally permitted protest is planning the riot is a big big stretch.You are very ignorant. But yeah ride that fenceAnd those who testified said their was no plan to enter the capital.Alex Jones already explained exactly what happened.""The Guardian has shown the documents to independent experts who say they appear to be genuine. Incidental details come across as accurate. The overall tone and thrust is said to be consistent with Kremlin security thinking.""\s\sThis is the problem with the story - amazing bombshell shitty sourcing. The grauniad has some documents and they *seem* real enough but really who knows. Maybe it's true maybe it's authentic but maybe it's just some bullshit somebody made up because there's an audience for it out there.We won't know for sure unless the Biden administration makes a public statement. If the CIA decides they're genuine Biden might have to do something diplomatically maybe sanctions.How do we know these documents are authentic?We don't. Independent experts have said the documents seem genuine and intelligence agencies know about them. Actual confirmation will probably only happen if the Biden admin makes a statement.\s\sWhen I first read this I figured it had to be fake. The Putin signature the Trump insults and the reference to unspecified ""certain events"". But after reading it again I think that someone forging something like this would come up with a more realistic sounding lie. I think it's real but who knows until we get confirmation.I'll upvote literally anything that isn't about lefties twitter or ""g\*\*\*no""Woah!This isn’t really that huge. Governments have been interfering in elections for over a hundred years. Historians have even established that massive election interference was going on by the British and Germans when FDR was running for his third term. [(Source) ](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300205749/1940)Iran and China interfered on Biden’s behalf and Russia did for Trump. None of this is news to people who are well informed on the subject. \s\sThe only thing that can be construed as “huge” is the alleged confirmation of kompromat in the documents. However it doesn’t even seem to confirm that kompromat exists. The article spends only a few sentences covering what would be the biggest scandal in the past few decades using very vague language. It’s pretty clear that author was just grasping at straws here. \s\sOverall if the documents are credible we haven’t really learned anything new. It won’t affect people who think Russia hasn’t interfered in the election because everyone who thinks that at this point will think everything negative of Trump is fake news. The media certainly hasn’t helped considering that they treat interference and collusion as essentially the same thing with their partisan editorializing of unfortunately common occurrences in international espionage.No offense but I don’t think anyone cares about thisIf Trump really was a russian stooge and he owed them money & was being blackmailed by underage piss tapes or whatever... then wow did putin set a very low bar for him because he basically did fuck all to improve russian global position.“By this point Trump was the frontrunner in the Republican party’s nomination race.” nothing burgerIt will be interesting to see how the far right and far left react to thisInsane. I wonder if the current or former president have documents on their plans to influence other states' leadership?I have a hard time believing that this woman who was vice chair of the DNC for many many years was as clueless as she says about the party's finances.just pivoting to the left wing so she can participate in either Benies or Warren's 2020 run. Yesterday she was a DNC insider monster who stabbed the revolution in the back today shes a brave truth teller.Didn't she help Hilary ""cheat"" or w/e by giving her questions early for a debate? \s\sIt's not really surprising what has been revealed but *who's* revealed it.As do I but I'm appreciative that she came forward with specifics rather than talking in hushed innuendo. At least from my perspective having the missteps of the DNC out in the open assuages some of my fears that the country has culturally shifted in a significant way. It seems pretty clear that Hillary lost due to strong-arming her way into a nomination irrespective of the actual wants of the voters and that plus her hubris in campaign strategy lead to her downfall.[deleted]I think you're missing the point here. Neither of those articles say anything about the specifics of the agreement just that they existed. It appears that such agreements are proforma what is not standard operating procedure is those agreements being signed so early and giving so much control over to a candidate who has not yet clinched the nomination. That is a revelation and regardless of how Brazile is trying to spin it still warrants discussion so that the same mistakes can be avoided for 2020.Thanks for this insight. I also hadn't even realized the author of this passage is the same woman who leaked debate questions to Hilary.

I would highly recommend giving it a listen: https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/gerrymandering-podcast/Can’t wait for Hasan to go over this article on his stream. PepeLaughHonestly... I'm not that worried about gerrymandering. Mainly because it's almost impossible to get worse without jeopardizing different safe seats. Republicans are actually giving dems safe seats just to get rid of the competitive districts. Considering dems will prob lose those districts anyway in midterms it shouldn't affect much.\s\sEdit: just for an example. Ohio and NC got worse and dems lost one seat each BUT Texas gave dems 3 safe seats so it's kinda a washlolCurious what you all think. Is she brain dead enough to believe she will be accepted into Republican ranks over a harder right person?\s\sDoes she think this will make her more popular in a presidential run?

The less you rely on the USPS the better.\s\sHowever you vote do it as early as possible.What do you say to people who have fears that early votes might be tampered with? I hear that a lot from Southern democrats especially people of color. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sNot to mention a lot of these places don't have the same luxurious vote by mail programs. In SC for example you have to present a good reason (Covid isn't one though I believe age and other health factors can be) to get an absentee ballot.With the Democrats being so spineless in their reply to all of his PUBLIC admissions I am worrying whether my own politicians are this spineless as well.I think what you mean is complicit. They don't nominate a white racist rapist and a cop for no reason.  \s\s\sFor the donors of the DNC a RNC win is still a win.I'm honestly curious how much this will hurt his own voters compared to Biden voterswith his calls to take away Social security covid and the postal service stuff.

Will his execution be broadcast live?Nothing is gonna happen if his rigged election plays outAnd no one will do anything except wag their fingers while he starts his second of many terms.Do anyone have either articles or just a general feeling for weather people will go out and vote in person if they feel that they have to? \s\sMaybe I’m reading to much news but at this point I would start to feel doubt about my mail in ballot being counted properly if I was in the US. \s\sAlso can US people vote in person even if they’ve already cast a mail in? Or are you stuck once you’ve mailed the ballot? I’d be worried about increasing negative news as Election Day draws closer... :(Well now that he admitted it im sure we got him. Where Mueller at?Don't wanna be a sooner but I feel like Trump is definitely gonna win again. Hope I am wrongIs this sub actually falling for this vice sensationalist bullshit?\s\s""They need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots” Trump said on Fox Business Thursday morning of the states that are implementing universal mail-in voting ahead of the November election. “But if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.”""\s\s""“They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting” Trump said of the Post Office which is requesting billions in emergency funding. “So therefore they can’t do it I guess. Are they going to do it even if they don’t have the money?”""\s\sThese are the only 2 statements present in the article that Trump has made. None of them indicate that he is actually sabotaging the USPS to screw up the election.\s\sWhat do they say is the obvious: Money is lacking to update and modernize the systems of the USPS to process mail in ballotting and if the money doesn't go to the USPS they most likely won't be able to do it or will have an insane amount of difficulty in doing it which is why Trump questions the methodology in this scenario.\s\sAlso remember Congress puts the money into the USPS not Trump. Trump only signs off on it and if he doesn't then Congress can just pass through him. Not only is the article wrong the title is extremely misleading and bullshit.\s\sPolishing for the downvotes by the libs that didn't read the article 😎😎😎😎😎Why would anyone give Trump the benefit of the doubt?I agree that Vice and the headline are shit. But for the President of the United States in the middle of a national crisis to be gleefully shrugging off concerns about people being unable to vote and making it clear he won't lift a finger to help is a fucking travesty.God everything Trump did was so shady but the shit he and his people pulled between the election and Biden’s innaguration was actually frightening. \s\sIt’s weird we don’t talk about it more on this subreddit but we should.It’s funny that the Jan 6 riot is actually distracting from this more severe shit they were doing in the background. If trump did 10% of the shit he pulls he would sink but the sheer volume of shit drowns out any singular bad thing and people just ignore it.""The order empowers the defense secretary to \s\s**""seize collect retain and analyze all machines equipment electronically stored information and material records required for retention under""** \s\sa U.S. law that relates to preservation of election records.

Oh that will be the death of the conservative movement.I mean Fox has some good apples. If you ignore Hannity Tucker and Engram Fox and Friends and the Five they actually have some good journalists with dignity and ethics.

The bush gore election dragged on into JanuaryThis is something I think destiny should discuss.He’s been correctly critical of Manchin’s critics before but this seems way beyond the pail for me. He essentially is working with republicans to save the filibuster and create good optics for him at the expense of other democrats. \sAlso the section about Roy blunt seems particularly sketchy as it seems he’s implying the donors hook him up with some money or cushy job once he retires in exchange for a vote change. It’s definitely worsened my view of Manchin and I wonder what destiny would say about it.From what I can tell Manchin was the one that appeared in control during most of that conference call while the donors were basically glorified inter-party diplomats.Bit of a weird argument it doesn't change how he's trying to appeal to them and that they're trying to reach a common goal.I want to listen to audio but its 60 mins so it will wait so i read the article in the mean time.\s\s> THE GROUP IS passionately supportive of the filibuster and when multiple donors quizzed Manchin on his stance on it the senator displayed an openness to reform that is at odds with his latest public statements.\s\sDoesnt this kinda contradict your argument. He and the donors are clearly on different pages albeit in the grand scheme are probably closer than him with much of the rest of the Dem party (but thats not surprising).\s\sTo me this meeting seems more like a strategy discussion. Manchin has his goal in mind and this group has their goals in mind. They are meeting because in the larger picture their goals are similiar they want bipartisanship. They are discussing ways to move forward on that.\s\s> Manchin told the assembled donors that he needed help flipping a handful of Republicans from no to yes on the January 6 commission in order to strip the “far left” of their best argument against the filibuster. \s\sI think this statement is pretty evident of that. Jan 6 needs an investigation not just because of its historical relevance but the precedent of investigations demand it. If Benghazi can get one this should also. Both manchin and the group have their reasons for wanting the filubuster to stay but rejecting what should be a necessary investigation hurts their argument. This isnt an infrastructure bill where its dollars and spending philosophy at play. This is an attack on democracy that both parties should stand behind but is being blocked by a tool that in their eyes is meant to promote bipartisanship not ruin (which we can all agree it has been very much abused the past years).\s\sI think there is probably congress people who are influenced heavily by donors not doubt but this doesnt really seem like a case more just two groups with similar goals trying to find a means to an end.does it thoughThe leaks don’t really show the power of big donors as much as it shows Manchin’s power to control big donors.I wouldn't say plainly. It's hard to know just how much influence this group has as the language is pretty vague. The only thing this clearly establishes is that big donors have access to politicians which is not something that was ever in dispute.\s\sClearly Manchin was asking members of this group who will be working with Roy Blunt in future to make their preferences clear to him in order to put some pressure on for him to change his vote. We don't know the form that this pressure would take. It could be as subtle as a conversation or as much as a veiled threat that he would lose his future job if he didn't vote they right way. We simply don't know.Can I have meetings like this with my senator?Because it's ""self-defense"". In the racist mind any attack from a white guy to another group can be excused that way. \s\sOr in the words of the great Carlgon of Washing Machine: https://youtu.be/l9E2iEi6vMY?t=34m10s\sThe perpetrator was charged for his crimes tho? It's not like the neo-nazi walked out of the synagogue with blood on his hands and was congratulated by Trump himself for proactively defending his race against a Judeo-Marxist conspiracy to infiltrate and annihilate the Aryan race in the eternal race struggle.>why is the response so different\s\sThis is truly one of our times hardest conundrums to understand but after submerging myself in the politics of the right wing for decades and really getting to understand their mindset and nuanced perspectives I think I have uncovered the colourfull answer to this multifaceted behemoth of a question:\s\s\#8A4B08 BAD\s\s\#F8E0E6 GOODI'm not trying to excuse their hypocrisy but isn't it possible that the response is different because the attack was from a US citizen and not ISIS a foreign organization?What the fuck are you guys even talking about? I haven't followed the response super super closely but what I have seen is Trump and Pence condemn the attacks both sides blame each other (trumps rhetoric/ media creating division) and Trump even admitted he could tone down his rhetoric. So what is the issue exactly? Did Trump come out and say that the bomber was a good guy? I just don't get what you are complaining about exactly.\s\sMeanwhile circle jerk central is down voting to oblivion anyone who dares disagree with this nonsense. ""If either individuals were islamist we'd probably have a patriot act 2.0"" is not an argument you can actually prove. Me saying ""If we had Hilary Clinton as president we'd probably be in WW3 with Russia"" has the same veracity as that kind of claim. Are we going to sit around and argue about hypothetical what if realities? Sounds like whataboutism to me. \s\sThis isn't a place for discussion unfortunately. This post will get down voted to shit because you guys don't want to actually have a conversation about the topic or discuss differing viewpoints you want upvotes from like minded individuals so you can get your internet boners off thinking you're on the right side and everyone agrees with you. Some sad shit. \s\s > and Trump even admitted he could tone down his rhetoric.\s\sHuh? No he didn't. He said he was going to be ""nice"" when talking about Maxine the night that it all happened because of what happened. He didn't say he was going to tone down his rhetoric. He didn't condemn previous things he's said. He did his usual shtick of blaming both sides when he couldn't pin something purely on the left. Then right away he went back to his same old shit at that same very rally. He didn't come out and condemn the lock her up chants that were happening just outside of his plane as his spokeswoman chuckled. He couldn't even fucking feign an empathetic tone as he condemns both sides for what his own supporter did.\s\sBut whatever you seem to just want to shift the blame back onto us while bitching about reddits upvote and downvote system. We get to be fucking justifiably angry at Trump for this after the shit he and his base has done to our culture. Catch Necrotizing Fasciitis you  mouth breather.Eh I'm not a fan of Whataboutism. > Whataboutism\s\sHere we just have someone pointing out a hypocrisy. For this to be Whataboutism should would need to use that hypocrisy to discredit someone on another position. \s\sAre you retarded I'm really curious to hear how the bomb mailer was a white supremacist. Haven't read the full vanifesto but I wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple swastikas SS/HHs 14/88 mixed in with the weird trump soccer team stuffI used to be Racist as FUCK and I am not white.  Who don't have to be white to be white supremacist you just have to believe that whites are superior to other races.  Thank god I grew out of it.I mean can't we just flip this around? The left seems to really enjoy ignoring Islamic terrorism as much as it can and REE's over white terrorism in the same breath. There are also all those nice ""studies"" that look at terrorism conveniently between 9/11 and the Orlando shooting so you can leave out the two biggest instances of Islamic terrorism so they can say white terrorism is worse.\s\sThis is basically saying ""heh imagine if white people did 9/11 the god damn righties wouldn't give a fuck. Now why they so mad just cause it was a bunch of muslims? heh.""It’s saying in general terrorism = bad. It doesn’t matter which group commits it. \s\sIf a Muslim were to have done this who knows what would have happened travel ban v2? If one Muslim did it then they all could...\s\sBut because a white guy did it he must have mental issues doesn’t represent the group etc...>  The left seems to really enjoy ignoring Islamic terrorism as much as it can\s\s[citation needed]Convenient studies that look at about a decade and determine that overall Islamic terrorism in the US is insignificant?

But I don't like the estate tax for two reasons.  First I think it's wrong to tax the estate of the deceased.  And second it does absolutely NOTHING to solve the wealth distribution issue in the US.  That tax is nothing more than a show pony paraded around by politicians to convince the people that they're on their side.  \s\sMy first point is just my personal beliefs.  But I have no problem with others feeling differently.  And I'm open to feedback from those who feel the tax is essential.  But at the end of the day if you take a step back that tax solves nothing.  There is a saying (and I apologize for it's offensiveness) that money flows from dumb to smart.  I don't agree that money moves from dumb people to smart people but there is no question that money (in general) moves from the hands of the uneducated to the educated/strategic/fiscally prudent.  Just for argument's sake let's assume we could take every dollar in the US and evenly divide it amongst those who were 18 or older.  Within 20 years the money would primarily be back in the hands of today's wealthy.  Why?  B/c those who are great at making AND keeping money do so b/c they have good educations are strategic decisions makers are highly ambitious are good with money management network and have either some natural talent or good ideas.  There is a reason most lottery winners end up broke...........they do not have the attributes necessary to HOLD ONTO wealth.  So then why do we allow politicians (and ignorant journalists) corrupt us by perpetuating a myth that taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor is the solution?  \s\sIf you want to solve the wealth gap you don't lower the ceiling you raise the floor.  And you do that by empowering enabling and encouraging the poor.  Our poverty programs in America are a joke.  Yes they keep people from starving to death freezing to death etc.  But none of them are designed to give people the tools to climb out of AND stay out of poverty.  Our education system is an embarrassment.  The best teachers go to the best & richest neighborhoods.  We have allowed our state & federal governments to turn teachers into robots by instituting a paint-by-numbers teaching approach that robs teachers of their ability to direct a classroom discipline students take kids on educational detours create & invent contour classes to student needs etc.  It would be the equivalent of sending fighter pilots on a mission in which the plane was controlled remotely and the pilot's sole responsibility was to oversee the plane and push a few buttons.  They're going to get killed b/c the decisions and actions are a lot different when education is directed by people with no skin in the game who are managers not teachers........vs people who went into teaching b/c they love kids want to give to kids and are willing to sacrifice income potential to empower the next generation.\s\sAlso for political gain we have eliminated any incentive for the poor to remove themselves from poverty.  And in many respects we've made it financially impossible to escape poverty b/c in order to become self-sufficient you generally have to take a pay cut when getting off gov't programs.  I spent 365 days homeless in Los Angeles in '00-01.  So while I do not know what long-term poverty feels like I do have some first hand experience with what it's like to have no home no money need handouts etc.  The way we phase people out of poverty programs is inane b/c you physically have to take a pay cut to become 100% self-sufficient.  \s\sOur politicians also ignore for political purposes sensitive topics related to poverty such as absentee fathers children born out of wedlock drug use child neglect crime punishments for crime that do more harm than good to the poor (such as our policies that heap on fines or take away the poors' cars when they get a ticket or fine they can't pay) et al.  \s\sIf we want to solve the wealth gap let's stop playing games and stop getting distracted with stupid ""hot button"" topics that have a 0.00% chance of solving or impacting the issue.  Let's get real.  We have to better educate ALL people.  We need to incentivize saving rather than screwing the public by promoting a consumerism/materialism culture.  We need to give the power to educate to the professional educators not corrupt corporate fat cats from testing companies and other industries that have a hand in the educational cookie jar which are appointed to state boards of education by crooked politicians (I'm looking at you Rick Perry).  We need to call a spade a spade and be blunt about the fact that if you've got 5 kids with 4 women there is a 0% chance you can/will be an adequate father & role model.  We need to stop jailing every person that breaks the law b/c all it does is makes it impossible for the poor to take care of their kids and their responsibilities and make money (and it certainly doesn't help with money making with they get out).  We need to incentivize responsibility encourage ambition give people a reason to hope & dream promote AND teach money management budgeting and saving.  We need to stop putting immigrants in a box.  They are our guests yet we don't treat them as such.  Welcome them help them take care of them as you would any guest in your home.  And we need to stop making this about rich vs poor and start making this about people.  This is our nation.  We're a family.  We may not always agree but we are in this together.  It's unconscionable that we have allowed our elected politicians to divide us for THEIR political gain and continued power.  Most of all I think each and every one of us needs to take a vested interest in our nation.  If you're passionate about helping the poor then carve out time to mentor at risk youths participate in free tutoring programs volunteer for after school programs Big Brothers/Big Sisters donate money to camps that help poor kids during the summer etc.  You're never going to solve poverty.  But beat it into submission if we stopped sitting around pontificating about it and started rolling up our sleeves and getting involved."

What real hard core righties would like to do is close all the public schools and fire all those unionized school teachers.  ""You want your kid educated  then get out your checkbook  because I ain't paying.""CRT just gave them a new basket in which to throw all the race baiting and fear of 'others'. It has never been taught as anything but a college level law course but now they can say that MLK the civil rights movement and the new exposure of cruelty and destruction towards Black Americans in the past is all part of it. It hurts their feelings and rather than find a way to make it right or teach that it was wrong in the first place they just want to make it illegal to teach that minorities in America have been treated horribly in the past. Whats the old saying something something doomed to repeat it? Well I am starting to think that its not what they consider doom but rather its their goal to repeat it and the only way to do that is to hide that particular history.\s\sThe hilarious part to me is here in Texas.

This board pushed to include that (contrary to every historian that weighed in) Moses was very influential in the founding fathers works towards the Constitution and until just a very few years ago it was still taught that many slaves were 'better off' and 'happy' with their new lot in life as slaves. Yeah that board would never approve CRT into the Texas curriculum. But now anyone who teaches that Black Americans were mistreated is now castigated with the latest greatest CRT cudgel.Most Republicans are hoping for a different end to the U.S. Civil War and WW2. They just can't handle the truth.\s#Freedom Lovers!

He should follow Hitler's lead all the time"" and then I realized how different that sounds typed out vs how I meant it in my head.Ha.  I had almost forgot about the Bunker Bitch episode.  What a long strange trip this has been.It's hard to keep trap of all the wild things he did.I still don’t recall it.Trump has this backwards. Anti-American dictators who call for the execution of people that bring the truth to light are the ones that should be executed.came here to say this… he should be treated like Mussolini: summarily shot and then hung in the town square where people can stone his corpseI would volunteer to be the one to carry out the sentence. Gladly.The fact that he's willing to execute people extrajudicially is even more reason for us to work as hard as we can to prevent him or one of his cronies from ever holding power again.  This is a fight for our lives.  If one of these fucking nazis gets power again minorities liberals Democrats and anyone who criticizes Trump could be on the crosshairs for execution by death squad.This is a selling point to most of his supporters unfortunately. Remember in 2016 when people said if Trump was elected and then lost in 2020 that he would not peacefully transfer power? And the press just normalized the guy and gave him lots of air time and called people who made predictions like that crazy lefties?Not going to happen unless the democrats eliminate the filibuster so that voting rights can be protected.\s\sThey might do it too if the progressives start making noise about the privatization being discussed for the infrastructure bill (tax neutral so the rich aren't impacted but the people are going to have to pay private tolls and deal with mismanagement not just of the privatized services but competing services as well). They won't be able to pass anything if they can't get everyone on board so we'll see how much manchin sinema and the other hateful 8 care about personal profits from privatization vs voting rights.We've known he's a little bitch ever since he had fake doctor's notes to get out of being drafted.Remember the 5 D's. Dodge Duck Dip Dive and Dodge.Meh. I can't flaw someone for not wanting to be forced into a terrorist groupHe didn't want the world to know he was a cowardly piece of shit... *and he wants to KILL someone over it*.If anyone should be executed by this country it is the traitor who directed cultists to attack the US capitol as a coup attemptAgain…<raises hand>PLOT TWIST...IT WAS MICHAEL PENCE THAT LEAKED THE BUNKER BOY INCIDENTHim wanting to hide this information means he knew he was a coward. \s\sWhat a bunker bitch.Hitler also had a bunker....Interesting that he didn't go hide in his bunker and cry like a little baby on January sixth...I mean do we have proof he didn't? He didn't make that ""We love you go home"" video until hours after the insurrection started and only after the dust was settling. I can't remember what he was doing during those hours between the rally and the video honestly.[deleted]>delivers that message right into the minds of people like a syringe\s\sYou just remind me of something. I am a bachelor in communication and the first communication model we learn is called the hypodermic needle. And is just exactly as  you said it. It's a model that suggests that information is carried unchanged from the media to the public. The figurative syringe is because as a medicine o vaccine the messenge enters the audience fast complete and without resistance.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThe catch is that model is considered obsolete and is teached only as a way to understand the propaganda machine in WW1 and 2. It's said it's obsolete because now we have an audience who is constantly in contact with many media and has the mentallity to filter messages.\s\sNow is it plausible to revive this dead model because of all the qanon/terrorists?...Ahhh so it WAS true! lololol! Then the right-wingers go on about Biden in the basement...it's ALWAYS about projection with the GQP.No no no  you don't get it. \s\sThe piece of shit is what he made in his pants that day. \s\sHe is not a piece of shit he is an asshole.He thinks it was a secret.This is entirely in character. A dictator Trump ~~willl~~ ~~would~~ ~~will~~ would execute leakers and staffers who failed to cover up anything tha made him look bad.If that guy actually did get the presidency-for-life and unlimited powers his supporters want for him he'd be a second Idi Amin.Should be executed?\s\sHoly shit that’s absolutely scary! \s\sThis guy is worse than any boss I ever had. And I’ve had some bad ones.The draft dodging kind of solidified the whole coward thing for me.Meanwhile 80 million citizens of trumpistan masterbate to a picture of dear leaders photoshop'ed head on rocky balboa's ripped and oiled body.....I saw one earlier of his head shopped onto The Rock's body.My area is Trump country especially north of me. I had to drive an hour north last week and the amount of Trump propaganda just grew every few miles. Although I have at least four houses within a block that have ""Trump 2024"" flags and other Trump propaganda littering their yard.I never even understood why he was embarrassed by it. When the Secret Service says it’s time to go to the bunker you don’t get a choice. He could have just said “that’s how it works” and left it at that. No one would have even questioned it. He actively TURNED it into a big deal.And then tried to turn it on Biden by claiming Joe was hiding in the basement.He’s a bunker bitch draft dodger who also turned his back on his loyal following when they tried to overthrow the government for him. Straight sold them out to avoid personal consequences. The fact these hive minded nimrods still support him is baffling. True cuckolds watching this slob fuck the country they supposedly love.We should remember that this guy’s name is Donald “Bunker Bitch” Trump like we remember the name of Brock “The Rapist” Turner. \s\sUnless someone can think of something better to call him. Maybe related to his coup attempt? How can we make that super easy to remember?Leader of the Coup Klux Klan?He is such a coward.People knew he was a coward back in Vietnam when that bitch was too afraid to serve his country he “loves so much”. Sadly just like he said “he could shoot people on main street and still get voted in” blah blah blah whatever else he said about his cult 45 members[removed]Like we didn't know he was a coward when he dodged the draft lol.[Bunker Boy - Randy Rainbow](https://youtu.be/2VBevEYELQ0)I N S P E C T I O N SSecret service ordered him to go to safe room.

You know what's really happening.Or even worse accepting that sometimes bad shit happens to you because you made poor decisions.Have you met Christianity? Mormonism? Islam? Etc. Etc.Dum dum dum dum dumThese are at least smart enough to not predict events on very specific days in the very near future.Dumb people are quick to overlook missed predictions if they are being told new predictions that matches their world view.   I used dumb because after the first or second failed predictions a normal person would stop listening to them since they missed the mark.The same way Charles Manson thrived.Because people are ignorantI used to be deep into conspiracies.  The conspiracy nut mindset is more of an identity than a set of facts.  Believing in it makes you feel special that the rest of the world is blind and brainwashed but you know what's really going on.It's a mixture of narcism stupidity racism and blind anger mixed into the leadened piles of bullshit fed by the corrupt anti-american conservatives groups.because the movement is made up of literally the dumbest humans on the planet.It’s the only way dumb people can act like they know some shit that everyone else doesn’t.Because people are fucking morons.Because when conservatives push misinformation they don't care if it is true or not. And they're united by their hatred for anyone who isn't them. That's why they love Trump so much he hates the same people they do. He even hates Trumpers and they hate themselves so it works out.Dunning-Kruger EffectBecause they can find a way to explain why the prophecy in question didn’t come true. The bar can be raised or lowered at any time for any reason.Because too many people have shit for brains.It’s really because there are too many people glorifying politicians. These QAnon types identify AS not WITH Donald Trump whether they want to admit it or not. They take anything negative happening to Trump as an attack on themselves so they sugar coat it the way we all do when something negative happens through coping mechanisms.Followers of prophetic cults have a tendency to double down when the prophecies don't come through. Some sort of combo of a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance and the sunk cost fallacy. William Miller predicted Christ's return in 1844. There are currently more than 21000000 adventists in the world. Go figure.Because stupid mother truckers...Why works religion?\s#Freedom Lovers!

Jones is a clout-chaser and I have to assume that he was making it up considering that Trump didn't appear on his show much after the election.

Why would this be any different?> Isn't it literally a thing already to subpoena phone records in court cases? Why would this be any different?\s\sThere is no legal difference.  This is the congress not a court of law but the subpoena powers of congress are equal to that of the US DoJ.\s\sLike I said the traitors are getting nervous.I think she’s conflating two issues - either on purpose to mislead her base or accidentally because she’s too stupid to understand what she’s talking about. \s\sAs I understand it the committee doesn’t (yet) have a subpoena.  So as an alternative they **could** just issue a request to the various communications companies to voluntarily hand over the data now and skip the need for getting a judge to sign off on it first. If they asked that and the companies went along with it then there would arguably be a conversation to be had around the potential privacy implications (if they’re willing to hand over the data to these guys without a subpoena then who knows who else they’re giving it to etc) - and by the sounds of it this is the conversation MTG is trying to have now essentially claiming that the committee has made this request and the companies involved are considering whether or not to give up the data. \s\sThe problem of course is that that **isn’t** what’s actually happening. What the committee has actually done is reached out to the relevant companies and said something to the effect of “hey we’re gonna be applying for a subpoena for some of this stuff so we’d appreciate if y’all could make sure not to delete it before we get there” - a totally reasonable (and routine) request that doesn’t get anywhere near the straw man what MTG is arguing with. \s\sThe concern is that by getting in this early they’re continuing to nurture the seeds with their base that all of these companies were in on The Steal so that when they do eventually comply with a subpoena Tucker et al can call back to how they voluntarily breached everyone’s privacy etc and bury the fact that this is an entirely normal legal process even further.Something something if you don't have anything to hide  something about why would it matter? Isn't that the typical response to illegal search and seizure of people of color? And this would be exactly legal and constitutional. \s\sNot to mention is she threatening to blow up the Nashville AT&T building again? Short of that how's she going to shut them down?“…..again?”Two of the worst people in existence on one screen. I fucking hate these shithead liars.Her and Lauren Boebert - both total nut jobs.. among many of course but they seem to be in the exact same realm of insane-ness.She vastly overestimates her power. Then again I'm pretty sure she doesn't even know what her job is.It’s over Marjorie we have the high ground. Don’t try it!Yeah she's not shutting down shit.her 'threat' reeks of desperation and fear. is she scared of something?She thinks she's got power and she wants her voters to believe her. Fake it till you make it.[deleted]Let's spread the word: the GOP wants governmental control over private industry. What do political scientists call that system of governance again?How is this legal? Don’t phone records get pulled all the time?Can confirm. Wireless companies comply with court subpoena requests on the dailyWe already know she's completely crazy. There's a definite chance that there's some dodgy people on her records.

It is cringey afComcast and Verizon are calling in an “Epstein” as we speak.I'm sure international telecom conglomerates are quaking in their boots that some rando waitress who failed upwards from Karen filled MLM schemes to the pedo-caucus of Congress is going to be able to somehow ""shut them down"".Does Representative Greene have any actual power in this case or is this just angry barking?Subpoenas happen regularly in law she is definitely just barking. Animals tend to bark when they are scared.Weird how they went from “let the business do their thing” to “maybe China isn’t so bad” so quickly…QuntBut…but… surely she’d want to see those ANTIFA goons who organised it and stormed the capitol brought to justice right?So….government overreach into the private sector is A-OK on this one huh Margie-poo?How is this not illegal. You are pressuring and intimidating someone to not comply with law enforcement.> How is this not illegal.\s\sIMO it is illegal.  Obstructing a congressional investigation is a serious felony.

Like aw heck don't worry about it and that's weird. They should all be impeached and permanently disqualified to hold any office of trust.""I'll shut them down""\s\sHow? Are you getting trump as their CEO?I’d like to see her try. LoLOne lone Dipshit can't actually do that.Is something wrong with Tucker? His face is scrunched up in the thumbnail Pic.Thank God Pelosi holds the gavel. If the GOP controlled the House we would be suffering through a new round of Bhengazi horseshit.Let them fucking sweat.Can they even do that?

What they're doing is a *feint* intended to make you believe that they want to escape because it further destroys the discourse and derails it into a piece of #NotAllFascists fuckwaddery.>the one thing we should recall from Watergate is that the heroes of Watergate were Republicans who would not tolerate Richard Nixon’s conduct.\s\sYeah right! They appointed him their leader in the first place...Trump too!\s\sGetting rid of them is your responsibility not a triumph.There were no Republican “heroes” in the Watergate affair. A few of them grudgingly opposed Nixon out of self-interest or to protect the future of the GOP.I've honestly given up hope that Trump will ever face justice for his crimes. The US  is absolutely broken.I've known for a long time that he's not going to face justice.  He's not even going to be mildly inconvenienced. 😒Usually I'm not one for conspiracies. One which I've nonetheless found to be a compelling narrative (though still one lacking in evidence to my knowledge) relates to Watergate. Nixon's ""White House Plumbers"" had been established to prevent further leaks of information after the publishing of the ""Pentagon Papers"" which detailed illegal activities conducted by US intelligence agencies and the military in Vietnam. The plumbers also engaged in a number of other activities such as the break-in at the Watergate Hotel. The conspiracy theory here is that during the Watergate investigations some of the information the White House Plumbers had stopped from leaking came to Congress' attention and that whatever that information was happened to be spicy enough that the threat of Democrats leaking it to the press was enough to get Republicans to agree to the impeachment and conviction of Nixon. The actual nature of this information is where this theory really goes into the realm of conspiracy as everything from CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination to COINTELPRO and MKUltra to US War Crimes to corrupt dealings by other Republicans are alleged as being the blackmail used to ensure Republican cooperation. If this theory is true (which it may or may not be) it might point to the ""missing ingredient"" lacked by the Trump impeachment which was a failure when compared to the Nixon impeachment.Yeah we don’t have any of those anymoreI find it funny how Trump has been calling fraud for months but in the end he's the one asking Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" votes like there's caches of Trump votes hidden around like lego star wars minikits.the AG should've jebaited him by requesting that Trump have his people send ballots to him.Perdue went on Fox News to say the AG of Georgia should be ashamed of himself for taping and leaking a recording of a sitting president. \s\s\s#Perdue is a seditious imbecile!

It could have gone that way worse still it could have gone that way by some extra-legal means.

Biden's win and inauguration is a very big and hopeful sign that we may have passed the test and what happens to the insurrectionist's within the government and without will be the final part of this test. They cannot walk there must be consequences or we will have failed the test.Like how for decades joint smokers and dime baggers(yea-so i'm old) were sent to jails and prisons for their crimes under the greatest democracy with its credo of 'Rule of Law' while tobacco ceo's lied in front of the senate concerning the effects of nicotine and how many served time or were even personally fined? None of course.  Fine the persona of the 'corporation' and pass the costs to the consumer and as tax- writeoffs...Guess we're paying uptrump has done the worst to us so far.  He needs to be held accountable.  That’s how we move forward.  And that’s how we heal.No there won't be a high price. The cost will be total. \s\sAmerica is dead if he's not held accountable.

All I had to do was not put a creepy condescending paternalistic ""x"" on the end of it.\s\sEDIT: ""Latine"" is another way of spelling it which has at least *some* traditional usage by members of the community that the term refers to. That's my problem with ""Latinx"" if that wasn't clear. It's a term imposed by the most upper-crusty of the elite upon the community that it labels. The word does EXACTLY the thing that it purports to avoid.[deleted]This is why helping to get out the vote is so important.His argument about “protecting our own voters” makes zero sense. GOP voters are the preferred voters in basically every way under the current system.I read protect their voters from their own broader suppression.Party of victim mentality.We already saw this with the primary. It's so fucked up!!Remember. Electoralism is a Hobby and nothing more. Your praxis should not involve asking the oppressors to be good on their terms.Republicans are so gross.Quickly followed up by an angry tweet demanding all White House staffers and loyalists have all verbal conversations in a faraday cage.We are so so fucked.The fix is in.https://youtu.be/8GBAsFwPglwNormal countryEven if my vote will make a microscopic impact I still believe I should vote. If its rigged ok then just more ammumition to bring em down with once we have turned the tables. Plus I find it ironic that everyone was in panic over russian interference but no one is worried about interference from within our own country. The world is more messed up than the people in picasso's paintings.Republicans like to convince themselves that Democrats are constantly cheating so that they feel justified in cheating themselves. The problem is that they have found any modern presidential campaigns that featured Demcratic cheating but nearly all have featured Republican cheating.\s\sGrag Palast's book ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"" details the steps that Florida Governor Jeb Bush took to throw the election in favor of his idiot brother in 2000. It started before the election by generously purging the voter rolls in primarily Democratic counties and continued after the election when the Republicans used a little known law about challenging votes to challenge thousands of Democratic votes in Democratic counties while challenging very few Republican votes. Those challenges were not investigated or answered just thrown out for no reason other than the Republican party challenged them for unknown reasons. People who had voted and thought their votes counted had their votes tossed out for no reason completely unbeknownst to them. There were other schemes like disappearing ballots etc.\s\sThat has become the basic playbook for voter suppression and it continues in every Republican election. To this day nearly every important election in Florida is won by Republicans and by a razor thin margin. \s\sThat playbook is now being used in other Republican states and they have added plenty of other tricks as well (closing of polls in Democratic leaning areas non-counting of absentee and mail-in ballots non-mailing of mail in ballots etc.).\s\sOn one of his recent interviews on Fox News Trump railed against the concept of election becoming mail in only saying that Republicans would never win another election. If your party can't win when EVERYONE votes then perhaps your party needs to alter their agenda.Rush Limbaugh was encouraging voters in California and Chicago to ignore stay at home orders because they'd already crossed over into ""herd immunity.""  The locales aren't random... he has an intense hatred for the ""Democrat Party"" in California and Chicago.  And he wants to see how many people he can kill apparently.\s\sHe's on PUBLIC airwaves too!  Can anyone tell me why we allow propagandists who are actively trying to kill Americans on our PUBLIC airwaves?  Is the a First Amendment thing?  He has the god-given right to try to kill use because... well just because?So what? Everybody knows (or should know) there is voter supprssion. Both in the general and in democratic primaries. And most people don't give a fuck.I don’t think people know actually. I think people are unaware outside of the lies and racist delusions Trump spinsAnd you’re going to do nothing about it.

Many GOP voters were caught directly participating in election fraud include elected officials as well as GOP voters who voted for dead parents or in one high-profile case murdered his wife (suspected but c'mon) and then voted for her.\s\shttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/15/man-suspected-wifes-death-cast-ballot-her-name-court-docs-say/5108597001/**G**aslight **O**bstruct ***P****roject*.\s\sThe real meaning of the GOPCommitted by a person named Tiny Peters 🤣As with every other catchphrase they spout it turns out “Stop The Steal” was a confession not a rallying cry.Every fraud is pro Trump too amazing.Don’t get it wrong here.

Basically she is trying to prove fraud by being fraudulent. And some of the people here eat it up like candy.>""Peters denies wrongdoing in the data leak the breach is now the subject of investigations by local state and federal investigations.

What do you do😂 is it just like an “oh fuck” moment?It's like Book of Mormon just double down on your beliefs and everything will be fine.Right then instead of trying to cover it up and hide it one of you goes on a coast to coast tour talking about it.Bold of you to assume:\s1. She's capable of introspection\s2. She's capable of admitting fault\s3. Won't just readjust her conspiracy to preserve her worldview and identity built around that conspiracyAh there's some fraud!The election fraud is coming from *inside* the house!I bet the FBI knows where Tina Peters is. If she's used her own phone or credit cards once since she went to ground they've got her. She's not that clever.Lol man I’m basically a jr bsa/aml guy at my bank I always try to get tellers to ask what’s going on when it’s certain amounts of cash out and people are always saying they don’t want the irs to know. It’s like man you’re cashing a check from a business for 11k and depositing a little to avoid a ctr like that matters you think the business isn’t also reporting what they paid you or what? People are fucking dumb.In  Wa State we have a GOP sec of state. Sec of states oversee voting in states; that's how for example Kemp became Governor of Georgia. He was sec of state and set up the voting system that disallowed Abrams her victory as governor. During 2020 I worked for the D candidate.  The R sec of state was the incumbent. Ppl activist type ppl would say to me ""but R is one of the good Republicans"".  Of course the ""good Republican"" was elected and of course Latino voters in rural areas of the state had their ballots disallowed bc their ""signatures didn't match those on file."" Which caused Rs to win elections by small numbers and caused lawsuits. \s\sIn short never ever vote for the GOP candidate for your state's sec of state.  Their loyalty isn't to the Republic its to the weird GOP party.Governor Kemp and his state capitol cops should be in prison for attempting to frame Park Cannon for assaulting a police officer.  Video evidence proved that was a lie.  For me just dropping charges won't do.  Brian Kemp needs charged for false testimony and voter intimidation.  Oh and I know all about him stealing the election from Abrams.There is no such thing as a ""good Republican"". The only way they might look good is if you compare them to primary challengers which will always be to the right of them and more radical.Just a reminder that Peters is in Lauren Boebert's district.\s\sThe very same Lauren Boebert that underreported her husband's income by like a million bucks on her FEC forms.\s\sYeah THOSE were the votes Peters was counting.No surprise.  I mean they talk about fraud and then it comes up that there was fraud!  Like when someone used their dead mother's vote for Trump because ""that's who she would have voted for!"" or the guy killing his wife and using her vote for Trump.  Don't forget the guys in the Hummer with bags of ballots all for Trump!  \s\sSure there's fraud...but it's not the fraud you are looking for.Have they updated the dead mother vote since [this](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Pennsylvania-Lt-Gov-Fetterman-relentlessly-15822777.php)?So Lindell made a fortune selling pillows and today he's hiding a fugitive and is facing a serious lawsuit that will wipe his entire fortune away because he wants Donald Trump to be president again. Er should someone get a urine sample from this guy?How about that Mike found fraud after allThese people have the mentality of “I would commit fraud for what I want so they must be doing it too!” They don’t get it that more people wanted tRump outIt's pretty much their MO with everything.  This is one of the reasons why all of their fantasies about ""socialists"" putting them in FEMA camps and executing them with 50-person guillotines inside of three-tiered railroad cars stored on spurs in the upper midwest before taking them to the Amtrak yards in Indianapolis where the Deep State has secretly built a giant crematorium terrify me so much.I'm questioning this whole narrative of Lindell ""hiding"" this gal. So you're telling me a national public figure who appears on some talk show somewhere every day is in no way trying to keep a low profile and apparently keep no secret about hiding this lady can't be picked up by LE for hiding a fugitive?\s\sEither he's lying or this gal really isn't ""wanted""That's an interesting thought. The FBI is notorious for moving slowly not through incompetence but because they're exceedingly thorough. That doesn't explain why state or local officials haven't subpoenaed him or issued an arrest warrant if he's defying a subpoena.\s\sMy only guess is that at this stage Peters is a ""person of interest"". I haven't seen anybody reporting on an arrest warrant or indictment for her yet. I have no idea what the threshold is for ""obstruction of justice"" and whether Lindell can be brought up on charges for assisting her in avoiding these investigations but the way Lindell is publicly talking about hiding her is a stupidly exposed position to put himself in.  \s\sI love the irony that Lindell is openly supporting somebody who stands credibly accused of undermining elections she was charged to protect. I'm also damn glad to see Ron Watkins getting roped into this mess. 😃LE doesn't always pick up suspects immediately. Sometimes they wait and watch so they can scope out the rest of the network.\s\sAs I said in another comment on this post I suspect the FBI knows where she is.FBI covers all their bases. It might look slow but when they bring you in… well there aren’t many loop holes left open.To date there are many verified instances of 2020 ""voting fraud"" however I have yet to see any attributed to a Democratic party member.Texas Lt. Gov. Patrick still owes Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Fetterman three million bucks for catching dead mothers voting~  https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Pennsylvania-Lt-Gov-Fetterman-relentlessly-15822777.phpSo the election was fraudulent because of the machines?  but reality says that PEOPLE voted twice PEOPLE hid and threw ballots away and statistics show it was REPUBLICAN PEOPLE that did all the fraudulent things. SmhTurns out the fraud that Lindell has been searching for so tirelessly was ~coming from inside the house~How do you think he came up with his irrefutable evidence?Harboring a material witness or potential felon. Good luck in prison Mike. You'll need some of your pillows to bite.HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Pillow biter.The dude faces more serious charges than she does.  Sedation can get you hung.  He's going for broke.  They all are.You see that fucking mustache? Does that look like someone who’s going to be the bitch? LolOh look more election fraud by Republicans. I'm so surprised. Look at how shocked I am.Peters needs to come out of the mypillow fort and face the consequences!Man they keep yelling “Fraud fraud security fraud!”  But it’s all republicans performing it. \s\sMaybe we should ban them from over seeing elections.It's projection.They imagine it happening so they can justify doing it.Mike Lindell operates a safe house for criminals?  Is he hiding her in his neighbor's medicine cabinet?Isn't that called Harboring a Fugitive?She isn't a fugitive until indicted. AFAIK that hasn't happened yet.They should go find her and put her in jail. But it’s entirely likely that absolutely nothing will happenNear to harboring a fugitive? Federal crime if indictment handed down?Grifters gonna griftThe safe house is made of my pillowsYou have quite the pillow collection then.They couldn't even cheat to win. Pathetic.Boebert won.Ooh! I remember her! She was involved in that ""cyber symposium"" in denial when Ron Watkins most likely Q got a call from his lawyer [stating that the data he was looking at was likely from stolen hard drives](https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1425543921166397446?s=20) and Tina Peters jumped in to say that totally didn't happen. \s\sI can't tell if this is actually related but it is regarding hard drives from the same county she was working in it appears.Did you ever notice that these hard-line trump thumpers all look like 40 miles of bad road?  Like 10 - 20 years older than they actually are?  Look at KellyAnne Marjorie Taylor Greene Cindy Hyde Smith on and on.  \s\sIt's almost like having such a rotten soul presents physically.  Skanks one and all.Tina is going to be going through some thingsAnd still…that county's voters wouldn’t recall her.Oooooh yeah.  A ""safe house"" because there are mobs of angry voters after her...the made up and endlessly trumpeted fear outrage and persecution fetishism of these mooks knows no limit.Tina and Mike are holed up in a motel 6 breaking blinds and staining every towel in that room with burnt brillo. I hope they have funSo she’s the one that stole the hard drives or whatever?Safe  house from who?One day maybe we can stop pretending that when it comes to politics and criminals in politics there's never any reason to look anywhere other than the Republican Party.A republican committing fraud? Whoa I’m shockedVOTE LIKE YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT.The ball is droppingIt was the demon rats who stole the election   not the other way around. \s\sWhat's wrong with being patriotic. What's wrong with having right of center political beliefs. It is not inherently bad evil or wrong to have right of center political beliefs. \s\sTrump is running in three years time. A mistake he is an old man. And he lost. The Republicans need to put their red hats on and come up with a new Presidential hopeful someone that is below the retirement age. Someone with a good brain. Someone who can deal on the International/Global stage. \s\sThe current president is laughing stock. The former president is a laughing stock. It's not right for the most important / most powerful country in the world. \s\sPersonally I am looking forwards to China's rise and rise. America has not done a good job of n1 superpower. America's foreign policy stinks of stinky ass. America has invaded and occupied an endless stream of countries almost all of invasions and occupations wrong and unjust. \s\sKamalla could swoop in to take the top job from Geriatric Joe but I don't want that either. \s\sIn the private world of big company CEO's you have a competent person at the top but in American politics you have grossly unsuitable people  running on both sides of the fake left-right paradigm.> It was the demon rats who stole the election not the other way around.\s\sAnd yet every instance of election fraud found happened in states where Republicans won.\s\sAnyway you have a British username why are you all-in on the pro-GOP bullshit?Nothing is wrong with being a true conservative. The republican party today is nothing close to conservative. They're straight up fascists now. Patriotic is fine and good. Crazy nationalists is what Republicans today are. Republicans are extremely far right of center now. Joe Biden is right of center. If the Republicans put a right of center candidate up for election they'd win today but they can't do that because they've painted themselves into a corner with their ideology now and can only give us their next big hope DeSantis.Learn to write first.When they find someone with more than half a brain and one iota of empathy by all means let us know.lol what a loserI thought Dominion systems with remote login were incorrectly counting all the incorrectly counted votes.60 lawsuits lost about all the election BS.

They excuse this behavior because they have convinced themselves “the left does it anyway”That's been very obvious for awhile now. Over and over we watched the Trump administration play this game of accusing other people of doing exactly what they were doing. It's predictable now.I’ve also heard that they believe the left fakes ballots. Because in their mind 81 million people would never want Biden as President. So that must mean massive amounts of fake ballots/votes.I have a close friend who was raised in an evangelical republican household. He was telling me about how the presidential election was stolen and I asked him for evidence. He couldn't come up with anything tangible. Just some ""well I know"" and ""people have said"" ramblings. So I told him about how republican groups were putting fake ballot collection boxes up in large cities in California that vote primarily blue. He didn't believe me. Shocker I know. So when I got home I sent him links to the articles from several different reputable news sites videos of the police removing them and interviews with the republican group leaders that put the boxes out.     \s  \sMy friend literally said ""Well that just proves that the democrats are doing stuff.""It is true that every election there are legitimate cases of voter fraud.  they're just never significant enough to matter beyond local races.\s\sWhat is it these people think they're making ""great again""?  In a great country every vote counts.  In a ""great"" country we encourage and support even the people we don't like getting to the ballot box.  We don't game the system by gerrymandering voter suppression laws or like this piece of shit deciding she had the moral authority to deny franchise to people she disagrees with.\s\sIt has to be worth it.  It has to matter.  Otherwise we're just ""grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit"" (to quote a philosopher of great renown.)Yeah this just made me think of the average individual who would commit voter fraud. Unless you are hacker supreme or an official. Why bother? You'd just vote for your choice and not be sucked into internet nonsense.""Oh look! more election fraud by those evil dem... oh.""\s\s""Hmm this is awkward""JFC you can't make this up for a book/movie/whatever and even if you could would be shot down by any producer on the basis that it's borderline ridiculous.What I never understood about people like this is your already breaking the law.

Obama tapped the wires too. Obviously.Lol. Not bad.  Here’s what he said via his spokesperson \s\sThis is disgusting. It’s fake news just like RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA was fake news. It’s just the Radical Left crazies doing whatever they can to demean everybody on the right.\s\s“It’s fiction and nobody was tougher on Russia than me including on the pipeline and sanctions. At the same time we got along with Russia. Russia respected us China respected us Iran respected us North Korea respected us.\s\s“And the world was a much safer place than it is now with mentally unstable leadership.”Just remember this 'leak' serves Putin's interest too.\s\sNot as much as keeping Trump in the White House would have but silver linings everywhere.*unfair*\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSeems to be his favorite word these days.It is fake news to cover up the fraud votes in az and gaOoh!\s\s*Kompromat* has a fairly specific meaning in Russian intelligence parlance.\s\sIt can be political financial sexual or a few other types but it's *always* blackmail fodder and they probably have all different kinds of this on half the GQP.\s\sI always wondered what made an old tightass like McConnell go with Trailer Trash Trump but his wife has those China connections...I find it difficult to believe any political or financial *kompromat* would stick to Trump and neither would infidelity or the fabled *pee tape*. Seriously if anything these past years have shown us is that Trump can do or say almost anything and get away with it.\s\sRaping minors might however and has been alluded to in many instances - from his own comments of “liking them on the young side” to many accounts from his beauty pageants to his connection to Epstein and the testimony by Jane Doe who claims Trump raped her at 13 (retracted after threats to her family were made).\s\sThere’s simply too much smoke for there not to be a fire and it’s been evident for years that Putin has very strong *kompromat* on Trump.\s\sEdit: I would like to add that I’m baffled a US president can be so obviously beholden to a foreign hostile power and not be held for treason. We might speculate about what the *kompromat* is but US intelligence would surely know exactly what it is. So how did we get this far? Is the truth more damaging than the traitor in this instance?What they didn't leak is that the Kremlin probably has kompromat on a bunch of other Republican senators and representatives. It's really the only way to explain why so many Republican politicians continue to back him while he does so much damage.Yes just like the Steele DossierWARNING: Luke Harding is a well-known liar.Most of the security people (and a good deal of the  left) that I follow think this is like Bush's national guard docs - it's fake documentation about stuff that really happened used to discredit an actual truthful documentation.   \s\s\sAnd ones of the authors of the article has been fed/believed lies before.Sx3 243dThis is the most no shit ""revelation"".Goes without saying Russia's got dirt on Trump. But good to have some validation.I love how everyone thinks that Russia aided Trumps victory. Maybe it's the fact that people shared the same values as Trump. Let's see remember when Hilary could barely fill a small gym of supporters that camera crews had to angle it just right to make it seem like the room was full when a third party takes a pic and it shows about 250 people in a capacity of about 1000. While on the other hand Trump could easily have on average 10k to 25k supporters at a rally.Why is there this obsession with crowd sizes. I will never be the kind of dipshit goober that stands in the rain to clap for a politician acting their own interests. Stop embarrassing yourself.I mean Russia DOES share the same  values as Trump. Totalitarianism wants to overthrow US elections hates freedom of the press loves corruption endorses violence  against political enemies.  \s\s\sSo glad you can see that.That's like literally every day here in Austin.

He is unlikely to become a better person. This ban should be permanent. No sane person wants to hear what he has to say. He's a compulsive liar and a manipulator for his own gain. He doesn't care about his supporters all he cares about is himself and money.Thanks for sharing!

There are plenty more legitimate and pressing issues in Denver and in Colorado that need to be addressed. If you don’t like boebert vote against her. Demonizing her and keeping her in the spotlight just gives her more press and advertising. Hasn’t anyone learned anything about how trump got elected?Being a traitor is pretty legitimate and pressing.Wow why doesn't this surprise me.  🙄Guys how do we get money out of politics. We need to figure this out for the sake of our country.By capping donations from corporations to $1000.Here's a start (good luck getting the corrupt goons in Congress passing ANY of this):\s\s1. **Eliminate natural corporate personhood:** Corporations are not people or citizens and thus should not have ""rights"" only privileges that can be removed. Citizens United is rooted in an unjust unreasonable and incorrect interpretation of what corporations are--and that the courts are now speaking of nonsensical things such as what corporations ""believe"" it is clear that they are on the wrong track.\s2. **Money is not speech**: Since SCOTUS already made a grievous error in jurisprudence they cannot be trusted to remedy Citizens United so Congress must legislate around it. Because corporations are not people and because money provides access but is not literally speech limiting their political expenditure is not limiting their speech and should not be constitutionally protected. \s3. **Term limits**: being a politician should not be an unending career. Limit the number of terms that can be served not just consecutively but in a lifetime\s4. **Ban on lobbying** within 5 years of having served in Congress.\s5. **Eliminate trading securities while in Congress**: it invites corruption in two obvious ways: distortion of legislation to benefit a Congressperson's portfolio and (insider) trading on inside knowledge not available outside committees or CongressStart by tracing the money and making that information public.\s\s\sIn CO we get as nice book leading up to every voting opportunity. It details the things you're voting on and what a specific vote will result in (this defeats all the double speak in legislature titles).\s\s\sAdd a section that details the campaign finance details.Banning lobbyists would be a good start. Too bad they've become entrenched enough to make a significant amount of the country vote against their own interests. We're currently reaping the results of defunding education for decades.HR1 For the People Act had very robust campaign finance provisions but was as usual killed by the GOP at the Senate. Unless the Dems actually take control of the senate while retaining the House and the exec branch you're not going to see it happen. GOP control at any branch of government means they'll block/veto anything that could restrict their virtually unlimited supply of dark money.   \s\s\sThe last administration appointing 1/3 of the entire Supreme Court means the GOP's precious Citizens United is unlikely to be overturned as well. The Republicans played well over the last 2 decades and cemented their Dark Money firehose pretty solidly in place.Vote for actual progressives in every single primary.I think things like national voting holiday or compulsory voting universal mail-in voting and letting felons vote would go a lot further to make our democracy more representative than trying the messy ordeal of getting money out of politics.[Here's a Colorado org dedicated to separating money and politics](https://www.nationalintervention.org/)Consequences for those culpable in both giving and receiving political bribes.Revolution[deleted]You don't. Winning requires a competent team and that doesn't come for free. Just because winners can get outspent doesn't mean they don't spend at all.By voting Republicans into the ground for 20 years until we can take back the Supreme Court then holding all the dems much more liable for this bullshit than they've ever been held by voting for progressives over corporate dems ***in primaries*** because splitting the vote later just fucks us.We won't effect any kind of real change until we make the lives of the rich at least annoying for them if not downright frustrating for them for more than a few days. Until then we are just ants that will never be taken seriously as they figure will never be willing to sacrifice what little we have to prove it to them. (And as others have mentioned the constant infighting they level upon us.)\s\s\sWe also have to be able to continue to enter this state at short-notice repeatedly whenever they challenge us.\s\s\sThe pandemic and modern technology offer a perfect opportunity covid sick-outs en-masse for 2 week periods for example.\s\s\sThis difficulty is compounded by the media as it is owned by the corps the rich people own so they will do what they have always historically done and censor any news about what is really happening. Social media could be a way around this.\s\s\sWhatever it would be until they feel uncomfortable nothing we do will matter as they all live in a bubble.The damage is done broheimI wonder if we could have government sponsorship and that ""do you want to donate to the POTUS election fund"" part allows people to donate a few bucks. \s\sThat fund gets split on the incumbents. \s\sIf there's $10 million in the fun and 10 candidates then it's a million each. \s\sOr cap it at $100K each or something and ban corps and individuals from donating at all. \s\sIf you can't make it happen on $100K I'm sure someone else can.Citizens United needs to go before any real change can happen.Tax campaigns!\sProvide an allowance of up to 1-2x the yearly salary of the position they are running for. Then tax the campaign 40% on the next 2 years of position salary and tax the campaign 65% on all donations above that. With a clause that all tax on campaigns go directly to deficit payments then when the deficit is gone this money goes to social security or infrastructure related programs.\sAllow the politicians to fund the government.\sTo be clear I am saying the campaigns not the people donating. We allow campaigns to raise way too much money.Read Lawrence Lessig's [Republic Lost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Lost).  It has several strategies near the end to work on the reversal.  Also it describes the problem and the challenges.What's the tax treatment for those donations?Denver should pass a law allowing citizens to sue any super pacs or companies that donate to politicians or political efforts in the city. The Supreme Court has twice ruled to allow the enforcement of the Texan abortion law which allows citizens to file civil suits for constitutional activities.Ironic given all the rich Texans that knock up their mistresses will likely come here to Colorado to have the abortions performed.\s\sJust like how [uber pro-life Congressman Tim Murphy](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/10/pro-life_pa_congressman_urged.html) pressured his mistress to terminate her pregnancy despite co-sponsoring an abortion ban bill.Heh. That would be poetic. But it'll never happen. Politicians on both sides of the aisle depend on Dark Money.

BUT if a COP with a gun fucks up they deal with a union and MAYBE a suspension.\s\sSome of the highest paying practices require licenses. Why can’t the most dangerous?Even teaching requires a license AND you don't get paid wellIt’s nowhere near the most dangerous.If we treat them more like we treat other licensed professionals I would like the following addition:  have them pay into malpractice insurance (from their paychecks) with rates based on their record.  You know..the way medical professionals have to.Seriously the hell is up with taxpayers paying for negligent behavior. It makes me rage. Make them accountable and I think we’ll see a world of change.And restrict influence on the system by professional organizations that will pop up (it'll be the FOP).In a way the police union is that malpractice insurance.Like I said the cops already have the peace officer certificate which if revoked by the state makes it impossible to be employed as a police officer. This is what the law that is being fast tracked will go after. To answer your question if i got my CO license taken away. Id go work in Massachusetts as I would still have that licenseThe certificate is “for life” it’s not maintained like a license to be a doctor or architect or barber. \s\sThe state cant’t even De-certify someone for failing to do continuing education.  \s\sThe only de-certifications I’ve been able to find and I’ve ready many of the minutes here (the only place the state releases then there is no searchable database) are for actual felony convictions. \s\sThey aren’t removing any officers for terrible but non-front conduct.  \s\sIt is a certification currently not a license. \s\s\shttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/post/agendasrecords-proceedings\s\sIn most states when you apply for a license to be an architect (what I’m most familiar with) you have to report on prior status in other states and a loss of license can be a reason not to grant it in a different state.Interesting. Thank you.How about includre higher standards before they even qualify for acceptance into an academyI don't see licensing as effective it may help with bad cops picking up and moving but that's where the supreme court will step in and find a rights violation that protects the bad cops.\s\sAccountability needs to be local.  Police are or should be an important part of the community they serve.  As long as they see themselves as separate and the community as their enemy they cannot perform.  I don't think that the police have to live in the community they patrol but the people with review power must.  People should have the power to remove bad cops from their wards.\s\sDe-escalation has to be the norm.\s\sDe-militarize\s\sThe police need combat the cartoonization of their culture.  Hollywood feeds a steady flow of a stereotype of police and city life that serves neither.  Point out all the scenes in a movie that would get a cop fired.  Point out why the cop who distains the people are shit cops.  From what I see in videos a our police have embraced the bad stereotypes.  No wonder they've lost legitimacy.Yes please. And if that license is revoked they can no longer serve as a peace officer anywhere in the United States.Licensed professional here. That wouldn’t change anything really besides they already have the peace officer certificate that they need in order to carry a gun thats what that new bill is going to go afterLicensed Professional here too.\s\sIt will ensure the following:\s\s1. They meet a mandatory minimum skill set\s2. They will have been properly trained to a universal standard\s3. If they fail to uphold the responsibilities of the license that license can be revoked and that individual will no longer be able to get a job in that profession.\s\sThis solves numerous issues. Including:\s\s1. Ensure consistent standards across the profession\s2. A feedback mechanism to improve training nationwide in unison\s3. Prevent bad cops from jumping departments when firedOkay and if you were to really really mess up. Would you or would you not have your license revoked? Would you still be able to practice what ever you are licensed for? Or can a doctor practice without a license? Police officers who lose thier license to be a police officer would never be allowed to be one again. Instead of having repeated escalted offenses. Basically extra incentive for police to do the lawful thing? And wouldn't mean anything for those good cops who actually do help our community.Wait they're not licensed? Who are these service people we are supposedly entrusting with our well being then?And then give the independent investigation committees we're creating the power to take that license away.They need to change the qualified immunity laws and hold them to the same standards as a private citizen in the event any force is used from dradly all the way down to just physical compliance.  They lay hands on someone they must be reviewed for charges.   Case in point buffalo today pushing the old guy down. Any one of us did that even if escaping a hazardous situation we’d be charged.  They require rhe same exposure before their attitudes and performance will change.I’m not quite sure how it would work but i’d like to see a non-leo (perhaps former officers exempt but also would allow the hi-jacking of the intent) body be the hiring organization for hiring LEO’s. \s\sThe FBI warned us years ago law enforcement has been infiltrated by white supremacists and we are just now standing up to the consequences of that.It will also create a nightmarish bureaucratic web of protectionist policies and deal making to keep bad officers licensedI’s rather see the unions get penalized under RICO: as criminal conspiracies to deprive citizens  of their rights.Realistically it's the kind of job that can/will give you PTSD if you are in a major city or high crime area so I don't see how being a licensed professional would help stop that from happening. I think it would be more reasonable for them to maybe just do tours or duty some how? Maybe make it mandatory for one or two law enforcement officers  live in the neighborhood they patrol? Ask Elon Musk to start working on Robo Cop?  \sJust spit balling ideas people.I think maybe we should be asking anesthesiologists about this then. The caring professions in general have a high rate of emotional burn-out and anesthesiologists specifically tend to have higher rates of death from drug overdose due to stress from their jobs. They're responsible for keeping the patient alive on the operating table and when they die it's often due to complications from the anesthetic. They see a lot of death and end up feeling responsible for it. To deal with the stress it's not uncommon for them to start using the drugs they specialize in and end up getting addicted and overdosing. They're licenced professionals who have high rates of PTSD and would probably have good insight into what to do about this.I'd prefer something like a quasi-military organization like the coast guard. Get rid of the union and put them in a real chain of command. Maybe even rotate them to different cities around the country every two years like the Army does.An interesting and accurate app I wish I could get my politically uninterested friends to do this so they could realize which party they actually agree with most. [deleted]Same.  It has me overall at 55% with the libertarians but I'm at 2% with all but one of the individual candidates.\s\sWhat I mostly got from this is that if I just want to vote according to my beliefs instead of where I think my vote should do the most good I should vote Green where I can and Democrat everywhere else.  Not really news to me.Same I was surprised how much the Libertarian candidates varied as well. This would be great if this was actually how people voted and ballots just ask series of questions on policies.  I would imagine it would prevent a lot of people just blindly voting for whatever party they want to align withThat would be interesting. Probably not go so far as to have a computer pick your candidates based on the way you answered questions but have terminals running this app in the voting booth or voting locations. So there's a candidate for governor named Harry Hempy and he's with the Green Party. That's so perfect for Colorado. There's more to Colorado than marijuana.I matched up equally with him and Hickenlooper (95%).

It’s not about the organizers wanting pardons for January 6th it’s that the organizers *already* had legal issues and had the understanding Trump would pardon them for *past* crimes if they put together a good Capitol protest.What? Oh God no we said blanket *party*!The question is: Will CNN _et al_ cover this like they did the withdrawal of Afghanistan? I don’t mean just report on it but drill it into everyone’s heads 24/7 for weeks?Yes.\s\sAs a foreigner I was glued to CNN for weeks after Jan 6th (I was watching their coverage of the count that day) and their shows were nothing but ""Republicans need to be held accountable for this"" up until last time I tuned into CNN which was a few weeks ago.So both Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs are listed as participating in these planning sessions and I honestly can't say I'm surprised.  I remember the shit-eating grins on both Andy Biggs and Majorie Taylor Greene in one of the photos from January 6th it looked like they knew what was going on and were just gleeful as could be.  \s\sI really hope AZ can kick both of those idiots to the curb next year.Perhaps the biggest story about the insurrection a d they put it behind a paywall?

Sweet fuck all and it will inspire and reinforce the notion to try it again.It's understandable and very easy to think this way. A couple of things to remember though is that 1. Investigations like these just take time. If even one thing is rushed it could ruin the entire case (though I do also wish they put the spurs to things). 2. Regardless of what the cheeto huffers say and do rules and laws still matter. And 3. It is the frustration into inaction that the likes of Traitor Queen and the others count on to continue their shit show. \s\sAgain feel the frustration but try not to live in it. Also remind your D reps and senators is past time they start swinging more hammer.I hope the January 6th Committee is doing a thorough deep dive into who each Specific legislator talked to and what they talked about. Im sure most had conversations with organizers but we really need to know if any of them went specifically into any sort of planning of the actual invasion and if any of the legislators had the idea in mind of the process being stopped that day by the crowd. If so they need to be immediately expelled from Conogress and brought up on charges.I'm sure that's exactly what they're looking into.\s\sIf there's one good thing about social media it's that many of these dodos including reps and senators left many a breadcrumb that can be retrieved and scrutinized.They’re turning on each other!\s\sOn a serious note I hope the journalism here is better fact checked and sourced than the campus-rape article from several years ago.  The last thing we need is to have this turn out to be fake sources.  Seems like RS is doing its homework this time though.of course they are turning one one another one of their real principles is ""i am going to get to be at the top and i'll knock the ladder down to prevent me from sharing it with anyone else even as i try to climb it""\s\sthese people would betray family if they felt it would advance status.So this is why some of them were so convinced trump was going specifically pardon them.\s\sNothing short of treason.

Since 2018 he has specialized in examining the QAnon conspiracy cult. His new book is The Storm Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement a Cult and a Conspiracy of Everything\s\sTo any reasonable person the failure of a long-foretold event to materialize should erode the belief that it will happen. A perfect example is the long-foretold and never arriving “storm” of mass arrests promised by the mysterious “military intelligence” team at the heart of the QAnon conspiracy. How could anyone think something promised for years and put off countless times is actually going to happen this time?\s\sBelief doesn’t need to be reasonable—particularly when it revolves around the punishment of the people you’ve been told are responsible for all of the world’s ills. And this stubborn lack of logic isn’t limited to people who think the deep state is trafficking children or that Joe Biden is actually a fake president. We all have an innate need to believe in good things that are extremely unlikely to take place. It’s the essence of hope. And a life without hope is . . . hopeless.\s\sEven when Q believers are presented with crushing proof that they’ve been fooled they still believe—often taking the proof that they’re wrong as proof that they’re actually right. To do otherwise would be to give in to hopelessness.\s\sBy the time of the COVID-19 lockdown Q had been exposed countless times as a fraud and a troll with no connection to military intelligence whose “predictions” were the same kind of rapid-fire guessing that a strip-mall psychic uses while the movement’s members were running into the law for their increasingly violent and untethered behavior. But to the faithful these were all temporary setbacks perpetrated by a bought-and-paid-for media. Everyone just needed to “trust the plan” and believe.\s\sTo understand why QAnon followers believe and hang on to that belief requires understanding why people believe in conspiracy theories in the first place. To begin Q is almost never anyone’s first conspiracy theory but the next step on a ladder that includes any number of plots and schemes. So when people find Q which already incorporates so many other conspiracy theories it easily fits into their world view. And it doesn’t mean they’re crazy or stupid.\s\sHuman brains need to recognize dangerous situations and we are hardwired to seek patterns to find order in chaos and to exert control where none can be found. Conspiracy theories at their most basic level assert that we are in danger from hidden forces. This helps give difficult questions and random events satisfying answers—and puts us at the center of those events. And we all do it.\s\sIf you’re hearing danger in a strange noise late at night or looking at a world event and thinking that there must be more to it than what we’re being told you’re just doing what your brain has evolved to do as a way to make sense of the senseless.\s\sOur lives are often full of failure—personal professional and collective. We don’t want to believe these failures are due to honest mistakes by others or random chance. And most of all we don’t want to believe that they’re our own fault. To believe otherwise is to believe that either we screwed up or that we have no control over what happens to us. And that’s just too horrible to accept.\sSuch beliefs don’t begin with the Internet nor are they more prevalent in the Internet age. Decades of polling consistently show that over half of Americans believe in some conspiracy theory and that about as many people in 1963 believed that multiple assassins killed JFK as they did in 2013 according to Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Use Them.\s\sNotions that someone is trying to get something over on us go viral for a good reason: many times someone is trying to get something over on us. Conspiracy theories can be held by people who work normal jobs have loving families and don’t spend every hour of every day soaking in violent ideation. They can take the form merely of irritating our friends with yet another ramble about whatever hidden chicanery we’ve chosen to believe in—our phone breaking suspiciously just as the service contract expires so that we have to buy a new one and so on. They can even be fun to speculate about—like the viral conspiracy theory about Chuck E. Cheese “recycling” unused pizza slices to make misshapen new pizzas.\s\sFurther complicating matters is that some conspiracies are real. Julius Caesar was murdered by Roman politicians conspiring together. A conspiracy of killers succeeded in assassinating President Abraham Lincoln with plans to kill both the Vice President and Secretary of War. A conspiracy of German officers tried to kill Adolf Hitler in July 1944. And the U.S. Public Health Service engaged in a grossly unethical four-decade conspiracy to withhold syphilis treatment from Black sharecroppers in Tuskegee Alabama.\s\sConspiracy theories on the other hand find believers because they fit in with our need to find hidden danger and revelations about how the world “really” works. As we’ve seen this is not necessarily a bad thing. But for many Q believers that nebulous feeling that they’re all out to get me becomes They’re all out to get me and I’m gonna get them first. This is the danger of Q—not that people believe it but that believing it means that those who don’t are the enemy.\s\sFor the QAnon adherent Q is not a conspiracy theory—and many believers bristle at the term calling themselves “conspiracy researchers” instead. It’s a way of clearly seeing the world and of organizing the players into columns of good guys and bad guys. And it provides its believers something nobody usually expects out of cultish conspiracy movements—hope. Q believers speak excitedly of the promise of a new future that Q would deliver—something ex-believer Jitarth Jadeja explained to me.\s\s“I wanted to believe that the good guys were fighting the good fight and in a better future” he told me over Zoom. “Q makes you feel important and gives you meaning and self-esteem. You are saving the world when you’re in Q [it’s] the highest way you can view yourself.”\s\sUndoubtedly at least some Q believers are in the grip of delusion to the point of being unable to stand trial for crimes they’ve committed. Others vaguely believe some of its tenets without specifically calling themselves Q believers. And some are just in it for the trolling—or because they really hate Jews and Democrats or worship Donald Trump. But those extremes are out of the ordinary. Many are just people who passionately believe in a thing that isn’t real because it tells them what they want to hear.\s\sThis is ultimately what brings people to Q and what keeps them there. The promise of bad people being punished is one element of it but the feeling of being part of something important and powerful is vastly underestimated. Q believers see themselves as soldiers fighting for the ultimate cause—and are surrounded by people who validate them rather than insult or belittle them or try to fact-check them out of what they think is real. Yes Q will sometimes admit to making errors in drops. And Q posts their drops on 8chan a place full of racists and anti-Semites saying racist and anti-Semitic things.\s\sBut that can be explained away or written off as just another attack by the enemy.\s\sWhat’s real what’s tangible to Q believers is how it makes them feel. What questions it answers. What holes it fills that other aspects of their life don’t. For many believers who truly see themselves as non-violent patriots it’s that simple —good feelings shared with a community about something awesome that will happen to people who are keeping them down.\s\sBut for a few it metastasizes. Sometimes it’s due to mental illness. Other times it’s need and anger curdling into violent resentment. No matter the cause the end is the same: from the Capitol attack to countless tiny familial tragedies the results are violence pain and shattered lives. And onlookers struggling to understand what about this was so alluring in the first place.\sAdapted from The Storm is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement Cult and Conspiracy Theory of Everything. © Copyright 2021Rothschild? So you're going to post something from the pedo cabal?\s\s/sThese are the same people who had conspiracies on their minds 24/7 in private for years or appeared in public with strange signs on the street on vehicles etc. and will follow anything that feeds their mental illness. Proof can't exist to them.My dad still pretends he enlightened despite wrongly predicting the end of America like two dozen times over my lifetime.  Basic logic escapes them they can conveniently forget all the disproven crap that happens repeatedly.I think it this point they don't want to be wrong. Put too much effort into it alienated friends and family. They want to say 'see I was right all along'.\s\sOr they are just batshit crazy insane.Jesus told his followers that the Romans were going to be destroyed any day now.  They watched him get crucified.  \sPaul told his followers that Jesus was coming back any day now--don't even bother getting married unless you have to!  Thousands of years later he's the founder of the world's largest religion.  \sWilliam Miller gave specific dates for the return of Jesus.  Seventh-day Adventists and other Millerite sects are still around.  \sJoseph Smith was a demonstrable fraud and conman with multiple failed prophecies who claimed the imminent return of Jesus was at hand.  Nearly two hundred years later there are a few million Mormons around the world.\s\sWhen you're dealing with people whose beliefs are fundamentally irrational you can't use logic to sway them out of it.  The fact that Q has never been right about anything doesn't matter to these people.  Q doesn't appeal to people's brains it appeals to their emotions.  As long as the enablrers keep feeding them outrage--that their lives are controlled by dark outside forces conspiring to keep them down but they can fight back by Trusting The Plan--they aren't going anywhere.  We are witnessing the birth of a secular religion.Looking back on my former faith in hindsight and now with a better understanding of my own sexuality I can't help but wonder if Paul was just asexual and sex-repulsed or possibly unknowingly and self-hatingly gay and that those might have influenced his apparent disdain for marriage and relationships with women and thus his writings on how Christians should behave with regards to such. On top of his far more obvious misogyny of course.Not true about Jesus. He didn't give a fuck about the Romans actually. Everything else is spot on.I think this article does a good job on it: https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/q-trust-and-you?r=1082k&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=copy\s\sThese people have a narrow circle of trust and everyone in it still ends up supporting Q lunacy.  So they see something happen look into the circle and the circle tells them ""the Q way is still the way"" and the nod along.Hopium springs eternal?\s\sEdit- read the full article and enjoyed it thanks for posting.Because people are desperate for some reason..it's fascists all the way downPipeline? It’s all the same thingQAnon *is* fascism. So is MAGA. No pipeline needed.Yes but the white sups despise Qanoners they see them as useful idiots which they obviously are. US fascists are more organized than Qanon and are instrumentalizing their infiltration in positions of power.[deleted]>>  the phony narrative that there was an insurrection.\s\s""Look did we group en masse and tell anyone not ready to fight to stay back? Sure I guess. Did we rally around people telling us that our nation was under attack by Chinese-controlled agents of evil? Yeah I guess so. And Don Jr. DID tell us repeatedly before the rally that we have to ""fight"" in his live stream. And maybe Trump DID tell us to march to the Capitol to take it back. I guess that part is true. And yes there were gallows erected with people chanting 'Hang Pence.' I SUPPOSE the optics were bad on that a little. And yes we overran barricades took the ground by force while beating law enforcement officers. And okay after breaching the secured building we DID maybe a little continue to chase threaten and assault anyone inside including the slow work of breaking through bulletproof windows en route to the legislative chambers. Yes an armed QRF was posted just outside the DC gun-free zone. And I suppose it MAY be true that some of us went into the chambers with zip ties. And yes pipe bombs were found later. And we had t-shirts printed and called it a revolution.\s\s""I mean I guess I could see how it might look bad. But how could anyone look at just a little forceful occupation of a nation's capitol under threats of violence and see the beating to death of ONLY one or two Officers and think it was a 'seditious insurrection'? It wasn't that at all. And you'd see it wasn't that at all if you'd just dO YeR oWN REsEarCh.""\s\s/s obviously.Let's hope they are met by armed National GuardI sure hope so. I hope that Biden realizes that he can’t just play nice with these people and I hope to god he doesn’t let them walk all over him. I know I voted for the guy but I still have my concerns about him and the other Democrats wanting to cater to these assholes.The only reason they got as far as they did on Jan 6 was because the capitol was intentionally left undefended. Hopefully they get treated like BLM did.As well as the FBI CIA and Homeland Security (Hell even MI6 if you can)I'm glad the Capitol police are on the ball with this but I can't see this rally being a big thing. Jan 6 insurrectionists showed up because Trump was there and that was going to be the day they did *something* to overturn the election.\s\sWithout him and without that driving force I find it doubtful that we'll see anything upwards of 500 protestors if that. Still I hope MPD and Capitol Police show they are in no mood to fuck around and show up in force.I doubt these fools will be able to organize in large numbers ever again. They'll be lucky if they manage to repeat something like the 'million' MAGA marchLaws of diminishing returns does suggest that this will be a much smaller terrorist force.something tells me the capitol police are gonna be upset with these guys about their dead friends.They aren't going to do shit.  Only reason they showed up the first time is they thought Trump had their back (as if he gives a shit about anyone but himself).“Rioters” lol… not insurrectionists or seditionists lmao.Heres a link to read it without creating an account.https://archive.vn/MgodjSomething tells me the capitol police won’t be fucking around this time (I’m not saying they were before but you know what I mean)Well they will certainly be able to give them plenty of support when they are sharing a cellIf they are prepared for it this could be a good thing.\s\sShootarrestrepeatSo nice to see MAGATs supporting BLM and Antifa:)[deleted]If only this were the case!Love how she wears her mask as a chin warmer. /sChin diaper\*God knows she shouldn't be on any kind of education committee.I would not give an ultimatum.

It's not going to end well for us as a country until people are arrested and they experience consequences for this shit.I've been thinking the big thing to watch will be rightwing activism leading up to the midterms. If you remember the 2018 midterms there was a lot of grassroots organizing on the right for the Tea Party movement which involved a lot of rallies and protests. As we approach the 2022 midterms if the Trump-wing of the party begins to start putting pressure on the GOP to back their Q-brained candidates by demonstrating in public gatherings I worry we'll see a significant counter-protest movement that will lead to violent clashes and partisanship accelerating from are already divided current state.His brother is still a 3 star general in the US MilitaryI tried finding their social media/hashtags because I wanted to see if I know anyone who went but nothing. I mean okay they do have a few hashtags and a crappy website but no SM. Where all the tech/SM savvy Q people?? It drives me crazy. Where was the marketing?

I know many of them bought into the lie the government used to dismiss the November election - voter fraud - and arrest Aung San Syu Kii and her party. So okay they probably thought they stopped a coup or something who knows.\s\sBut what the government actually did are still exactly what Q people are cheering. An unpopular government arresting their opposition and killing their own people including children just to stay in power. They don't want democracy because the ""wrong"" people get into power. They want to stay in power and will happily kill their neighbors to get it.I think the worst part is they *like* the idea that their side can execute their opponents and opponent side supporters.These guys know that the walls are closing in on them and they are running out of escape routes. Their king lost the election their last-ditch insurrection attempt at the capitol failed and their attempts to overturn the vote have failed. They know that only a military coup can save them from the consequences of their crimes now. It's not going to happen but they are desperate.Unfortunately an aggressive wounded animal backed into a corner is also at its most dangerous.

0,AmericanPolitics,VaushV,18,"I'm shocked shocked I tell you that conservatives want to keep people uneducated! Who could have possibly seen this coming?This is why I get annoyed when people on the left diminish the relevance of culture wars. Culture wars need to be won not ignored. And that's not me saying ""Abandon policy"". There needs to be a balance. When the right dominates the culture wars this is the result.It’s very frustrating when people say that the left needs to abandon the culture war because to me it shows that they’re not paying attention. The right barely makes economic arguments anymore when I first got into politics about ten years ago the arguments were all about economics. Granted most of those arguments were dumb and wrong but it wasn’t the endless deluge of culture war bullshit that we have today. The right can’t win the economic argument because we have the receipts but they know that our changing culture is going to freak out bigots and old people and that it’s a lot easier to muddy the waters around concepts that a lot of people have little understanding of. \s\sThe reason why the left can’t afford to give up on the culture war is because we see what happens when narratives aren’t effectively argued against. And this brings me to a problem that I have with a lot of leftists: I think that a lot of leftists don’t understand how common casual bigotry is in America even ones that are from America. It feels like a lot of leftists are only ever around other leftists and never hear some of the horrible things that even a lot of centrists say and by that I mean actual centrists. Leftists scratch their heads at why anyone would listen to Joe Rogan or Tim Pool but the fact is that most people in this country aren’t dedicated leftists who know that what most of these assholes say is wrong and can easily be swayed by their reactionary bullshit. I hear someone say something horrible about some minority group very often it happens so regularly that I just tune it out sometimes. And then you have leftists from other countries who think they know America better than we do and don’t understand that our government has been under assault by Christian fascists for the last 50+ years and that sometimes you need to vote Democrat to stop things like Republicans getting a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court so that this country doesn’t turn into fucking Saudi Arabia. I got a little ranty there sorry I guess I was bottling some stuff up.What do you think the next 5 years will hold for American politics? I’m honestly fuckin worried about a fascist takeover and I only ask because I can’t find an article about that topic online.This what happens when you let conservatives gain power.

We could have trained Afghans for forty years and the Taliban would still have taken over the country in no time.\s\sAfghanistan is a creation of the British and the local tribal elite of the country under colonialism.  The disdain for the Afghan upper classes by the lower classes within those borders imagined up by the British has been exploited by extremist Islamic clerics for 100 years.  This wasn't something that just happened with the USSR's failure there or the US's attempt at training an army who didn't see women's rights as a patriotic cause to defend the construct the British gave their elite.\s\sThe Afghan region is first and foremost tribal secondly religious.  We refused to accept what the British and Russians learned before us.  The next phase will be a civil war within the ranks of the Taliban that balkanizes the old map and it will be one  Moscow and Beijing cannot ignore.\s\sGOP ""I told you so"" thinking is short sighted and ignores history.Pretty much.

Just like the hundreds of millions of dollars he let so many Russians launder into his casinos apartment buildings and business building. They will never figure that out. Its Jared's Don Jr and my secret. Just like the meeting with the Russians. Trump represents the fusion of one of history's biggest egos with the self-control of an over-tired toddler. It's not that he ***can't*** understand it's that he ***won't admit*** to understanding. Also he may have an academic curiosity just how gullible Republicans have become.Time for the showdown.

Also why is trump still free?Not going to happen under either party. After the $600 bank account surveillance flopped they came back with $10000 per year in transactions that's an average of $208 per week in transactions and the IRS can gain warrantless access to your banking records. It's not about going after the rich. It's about going after the baby sitter the lawnmower man the kitchen tattoo artist. It's about going after every single one of us that might have some kind if low income side gig. \s\sNo the surveillance state isn't going away until we defund politics.NSA been doing all this well  before the Patriot Act....with the rise and empowerment of rightwing militias and the threat of that I don;t want to have LESS surveillance....Literally played like fiddleIt already expired.I cannot wait until the GOP is stripped of their representation in this government.

They are all far right extremists and terrorist insurgents.Donald Trump could shoot someone on 5th avenue and it wouldn't matter.  This leak won't mean a thing.  It's just further verification for those of us who are not crazy that Trump is crazy.  It won't matter one iota to Trump's supporters.It won’t matter one iota to those who unwittingly support Putin.   FTFY.We have known this the whole time. The 1st reporting i remember about the Kremlin link was in the summer of 2016. A ton of traffic was detected from an ISP address in Trump tower. The address only received traffic from one place in Russia and it was a lot of traffic. The article concluded it was a 2 way communication between Trump campaign and some authority in Russia. \s\sEverything that has happened since backs up this initial theory. The president of the US was a Russian asset weather he understood that it not.I'm not sure about some of the stuff people are saying about the Russia link but yeah they definitely wanted him in there wether he was in direct communication with them or not and even if he didn't realize that I don't think he would care either way.I wish any of this mattered to them. It don't.This is the smoking gun at long last held in the hand of Vladimir Putin.\s\sI would still like to see some work done on authenticating this or otherwise corroborating it.\s\sThis confirms what I already thought to be true to an astonishing level really so I'm a little suspicious of it.So if it's true now then why is Trump not in handcuffs and in prison for fraud and treason?So basically all Trump supporters helped Putin hurt America.

It is time for justice for all of them. No more stalling.Awwwww….what a shame.""Emergency motion""\s\sSo it's really bad.I notice you’re all obsessed with Trump.Can someone explain what this actually means. What is going to happen now.The dumbasses do realize that by removing him from office he may also be arrested and no longer a threat right?I doubt it’s fear of him retaliating. The fear most likely of them ending their careers because trumps cult will completely turn on them.Have you seen Trump's personality cult? It's scary. \s\sWe lost a local newspaper today. It's shutting down after being in print for almost 200 years. And of course when they announced it the responses were all Trump goons shouting ""Yay! Hurr fake news xD Far leftist propaganda! Fox News is the only reliable news source xD""\s\sI mean honestly have you even ventured into the cesspool of TD since Romney made his stand? Or did you see it when McCain died? People cheering McCain's death since he had the audacity to stand up to Dear Leader. People wishing death upon Romney and discussing ways to end his career.\s\sIt's lunacy. It's far beyond what we are supposed to be as the United States of America.Even if just removed from office what is he gonna do?  He’s already impeached so can’t run for President again...right?Trump is (very) popular with republicans voting against him will probably cause you to lose your next election. Simple as that.\s\sAnd the GOP would crack down on them too because they want party unity.I think they fear his cult not him. Not one of them is actually afraid of Trump. His cult has sent bombs to democrats justified and been pardoned for warcrimes emboldened the Klan and other hatemongers said rape is okay even if Trump wanted to rape their own - Remember the psycho Youtube bitch. That's all of them she represents them and what they think.They didn't say there were afraid of Trump...Well the thing is if he's arrested his followers won't be. These Republicans don't fear losing their jobs they fear their lives. Mitt Romney needs extra security like now.Their moron constitutions would not get them re-elected thenExactly it's like a cop not arresting you for robbery because he's afraid you'll leave a negative review of the police department. \s\s'A banana in the tailpipe!'That would leave Mr. Trumps supporters to lay waste in November to those that removed him from office.That's not the point. \s\sThey are afraid of a number of things \s\s1) they vote to remove him but don't get 2/3rds majority and are in his forever shit list. \s\s2) that after the vote they would lose the support of the gop base. Make no mistake. He is still very popular in the gop and with the republican base. \s\sUltimately 3) they are worried about losing reelection due to the blow back.Lindsey graham in particular is probably in bed with trump on something massively dirty and illegal. Idk how else to rationalize his flip flopProblem is as soon as he'd get arrested which he probably wouldn't he'd get pardoned. Even if the next president for some reason weren't pence whoever it is would need to pardon him. Trump having been the president means he knows a lot of presidential secrets and for someone as spiteful as him and someone who doesn't know how to shut the hell up as badly as him it would be dangerous for the federal government to leave him in a prisonTypical of tyrannical regimes. Hitler's sycophantic hangers-on were afraid to wake him up to let him know the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy. Same for Stalin when the Nazis had crossed their Western border on the road to Moscow.\s\sThe end is near.Near? I wish I had your confidence.For Trump or for the republic?Simply put:\s\sI hope it haunts them for the rest of their lives if he starts doing things that can no longer be excused. Things that actually keep them up at night. Arguably he already is but it hasn't been enough to bother them (yet.)\s\sPeople dying. Different parts of the government collapsing. The United States itself falling into disrepair. That's all on them.\s\sThey knew exactly what sort of shit Trump would immediately do if they let him off the hook for this so EVERY BIT OF SUFFERING that comes after is THEIR fault.I'm moving to Canada fuck it.......But they got paid so that other stuff doesn’t matterSo the Republican strategy is that they think it looks better to be in fear of the president than to be a sycophantic bootlicker. Well I have news for them whether they're one or the other both look pretty effing bad.Craven cowards. Disgusting.[deleted]They don't fear *Trump*.  They fear his cult of personality which has *long* since completely absorbed the GOP's base.  If said cult stays home on election day or finds new more Trump-ian candidates to primary them the existing GOP politicians in office *will* lose their seats (and with them their power).\s\sIf the GOP is going to get rid of Donnie they're going to do so in a way that allows them to completely deflect blame away from themselves so that their voters will still think of them as having been loyal to Trump.  Like for instance assassinating him and framing the Democrats or Iran for it.Many of these cult members brought the Tea Party to the Senate and House...the beginning of this crap. Not to mention Sarah Palin craziness that pulled the hoods off the nutjobs aka Tea PartiersThey fear us more.  The thought of principled democrats retaking office fills them with dread.  The question people should ask is what are they so afraid of once they lose power?Trump has probably spent his morning planning on revenge on Romney.I had a customer this morning bragging that Trump is now gonna make Utah into a giant open strip mine because of Romney's vote.Fear *and* greed. Not necessarily in that order.Makes what Romney did all the more impressive.Why? He won his last election by 43 points.  And he's watching in real time as Mormons lower their approval of Trump. He is in no political danger  and he's already survived the full force of both the Republican and Democrat smear machines.That's why republicns do everything: they are afraid of everything all the timeThey all have partaken of russian moneyTrump is a little bitch and every single one of those GOP members are cowards/ traitors to our nation.\s\sTrump supporters at this point are their own cult. I showed my mother in law all the evidence of what Trump did and all she said was “Well that’s NBC/ NyTimes/ Reuter’s (yup even Reuter’s) so it’s a bad source! It’s the Democrats!” My wife asked her mom what her sources were and all she said was Fox News. It’s like no matter how much evidence you show them they will never condemn him. It’s sickening.I look forward to seeing the reactions when he turns on his party.The thing is there are Republicans right now taking notes  learning what Trump did 'right' and what his missteps were.  And in 4 or 8 or 12 years they'll have crafted a candidate that will knowing the Right shit all over Trump's legacy and be more extreme.It's not just Trump. The the party has already had several senators unseated for opposing Trump. And Trump's attacking Romney. it may be time for our first Mormon president.\s\sI'm not Mormon. I'm agnostic - religeosly and politically. But Romney's record in the Senate is better than most.Marco Rubio literally said Trumps actions meet the bar for impeachment and then says he he won’t impeach because this is partisan. Not voting what you believe is what is making it partisan.Spineless cowards who piss on the constitution because they are afraid of his voters.Republicans have no spine and are cowards.Except Mitt Romney his interview was amazing.The word to describe that is coward.Cowards and CrooksNo they didn’t they did it for the money. If they would have impeached him he would have been removed from office  then the fbi state dept and CIA would have resumed all pending investigations and put his ass in jail or have him die in an accident.Of what? His tiny baby hands?I understand democrats are angry but this article is just pretending to know people's inner thoughts.bunch of cowardsChicken sh*ts. All of ‘Em.Yellow-belly cowards...Their districts are so gerrymandered Trump can hold them prisoner. But only if they are cowards.Fear of what tho?! You cowards WERE the check and balance. You stepped aside and now we all are afraid since he has no check. \s\sYou could have done what’s right and the risk to you already rich people was losing re-election. You woulda been fine monetarily too.Cowards! We're led by cowards.Shit ton of money helps with that.Cowards isn’t the GOP the party of tough guys or so they tell everyoneFucking cowards.Most of dictatorship have started with the abdication of Legislative chambers.The senate vote should have been anonymous.\s\s\sNo retaliation danger.I’ve never seen stress poor diet and lack of sleep take so long to finish someone especially one as deserving as Mad King Donald.What if Trump actually literally goes mad?  He seems sometimes to be on the verge.  And now he's enraged after the impeachment and the Rush Limbaugh scandal etc.They’ll be too afraid to do anything when Trump decides he’s going to make himself president for life. Seriously people we better have a plan for when this guy decides he’s not going to give up power.And?Just like an abused partner.I don't think it is Trump per se.  Though he is a complete asshole really he himself is limited.  Rather if you oppose Trump you oppose his vocal and let's face it fucking looney bin supporters.  Your office will be deluged with hate mail all sorts of threats made family members intimidated and probably a few real and legit threats will come to fruition.  Also the big money supporters will walk away.  For Romney he doesn't care.  For some farmboy like Cory Gardner?  Not only will you loose reelection but you will not get a job afterwards.  So these Senators are looking at loosing their current gig and then no opportunities later.Well no shit! If he goes down they all go down. If he gets imprisoned they all get imprisoned. Mob RulesFear of what!!?? He only has the power they give him! If they showed him they were in charge they could make him their pussy instead of the other way around!The GOP are a bunch of little wimps except Romney.\s\sRomney is an extremely respectable Republican.Even Lamar Alexander who is retiring caved. What is he afraid of?Fear of what Russians meddling in the elections and ruining the country?They're not afraid of Trump. They're afraid of Putin the puppeteer.LolThe fear that stokes so many people is death more than losing one's job and that's why so many of these warhawks in the Republican party like Trump and Cheney had multiple defermentsand now would gladly send other people's children to die. That's just plain cowardly but now they're even below the standard of cowardice. They fear the idea of losing their jobs over the loss of a fragile democracy. It should validate to anyone with half a brain that their true core worship is money and nothing else. Money over morals ethics integrity and love of country. The Democrats should remind people every day of what these people stand for; make their worst fear a reality in November.I’m tired of hearing all this “behind closed doors repubs know drumpt is wrong” ...repubs don’t care let’s stop making excuses for their coward behavior!That's because they are gutless. I repeat gutless.  Let me say that one more time GUTLESS.  Moral decadence has never made a quantum leap downward quite like this one.They’re afraid of the wrong thing.You know guys this is an objective assessment - don’t get angry - please: \s\sthe House rushed impeachment. They needed to build up the evidence for PR purposes. If you compare how Nixon was removed with how this House moved forward... it’s like night and day... in 1974 the House voted 410-4 to begin an impeachment inquiry. That’s not a typo: 410-4!!!!    \s\sUS District Court and the Court of Appeals and then the US Supreme Court ordered Nixon to produce the tapes... several of Nixon’s aides were tried and found guilty... his AG and deputy AG resigned... Republican Senators went to the White House and told him to quit... I mean the sky was falling... \s\sThat’s what it takes to remove a President and I think we rushed it in case. I just hope it does not backfire.Nixon wasn’t removed.Fake newsSo proud that Sherrod Brown is my senator.[removed]It looks like you’ll be on the wrong side of history then.Honestly rabbithole is right on point. This is nothing real different from the primaries or the general party stance. AND this is exactly why he will lose the election. He is publicly stating he is against the majority of the countries working class and lower classes. To Romney this is just a game a challenge to try and win. His career doesn't hinge on this he isn't in it to help the people. Obama has said even before he was a senator what his ultimate goals for being in politics are and that is to help as many people he can. These next four years the country is going to see growth as the plans start to take effect much like Clintons second term.I agree with everything until the end. Saying we are definitely gonna start recovering this next term is way too early to call especially considering the plans to get us there have mostly been shot down by a republican congress. Clinton had it easier. Anyways I hope you're right but I think you're being way too optimistic. What I feel we can say with relative certainty is that it's definitely not going to get worse. A lot of our recovery hinges on taking back the house. We take back the house recovery will be a lot swifter if we don't I don't see why it will be any different than the last 2 years.Stupid hippies and their anti-evil bias.  They need to stop shooting up marijuanas and having poo-sex and learn to bow down before Satan like decent responsible citizens.What is most hypocritical about this is that the people he is referring to are ALSO 'paying all of the taxes they are legally required to' just like Mitt made a virtue of in his own case. Is there anything here that surprises or shocks anyone? He said all of this during the primaries. Maybe tone down the title a bit.Calling people who don't earn enough to pay *income tax* freeloaders goes a bit further than that. And stating that he has to be careful in what he says in order to fool the independents into voting for him is also a bit past his primary stance.Honestly I prefer him in this video bit at least he's being sincere even his candor is 'better'. I agree with rabbithole spot on. Very disappointing - but not unexpected at this point.  How far they have fallen.Just following in Reagan's footsteps!I hate KansasIm honestly happy to see this. The people desearve the honest family value oriented government they keep electing. Keep at it. Im just sad for those that are stuck in that hell hole who will suffer. Trickle-up economics.

I guess it goes right along with their “Christian values.”You just nailed it the GOP has abandoned its entire platform if they ever actually believed in it at allFascists and authoritarians are famous for their law and order I supposeGiven that the Emperor of the Roman Empire was also the head of the Christian Church in the west for several centuries and in the Eastern/Byzantine Empire for a millennium (to the point that the Bishops of the Orthodox Church wondered how Christianity could survive without an Emperor when Constantinople fell). . .the history of Caesaropapism certainly means that there is a certain strain of Christianity where ""We **must** be lead by an Emperor!"" *is* a Christian Value.\s\s There are Christians who think otherwise and Christianity spent centuries not being ruled by an Emperor before it became the State Church of Rome. . .but there is an argument that can be made for ""We must be ruled by a monarch"" is a Christian Value for some people.That and greed. Those whose primary value is the acquisition of wealth or more than happy to support Trump's bullshit.Let's not forget ""personal responsibility"". You know like wearing a mask or getting vaccinated for the greater good. Or not giving your kid a handgun.Trump: “ I lost because of election fraud?”Oh man quit your BS. 40 something courts rejected that crap even republican appointment judges thew those cases out of their courts. Hell the committee needs to finish it job and there no executive privilege for trying to overthrow the U.S government. These aholes should be taken outback and shot for treason. \s\sFace it you were suckered into believing Trump's BS. Now that the appeals court has ruled that all records from the Nat'l archives  regarding the 01/06/21 insurrection  Trump is escalating to the SCOTUS. Same old Trump BS stall stall stall. If your or I were to manipulate property taxes the way the Trump organization did to avoid taxes or do the same to get more in loans we'd be in jail already. \s\sNow go get vaccinated.And they’re not being arrested for conspiracy why?Because Federal investigations of conspiracies don't work the way you see it on investigation procedural TV series. They take a long time to build the case. And they don't announce that they're doing it while they're collecting their evidence.\s\sRight now the House is collecting a lot of information and testimony for DoJ that DoJ would not be able to collect without tipping their hand. Meanwhile Trump and his minions think they're getting away with it because the House can't do a lot to them on its own.\s\sAs soon as Trump and his minions think DoJ is seriously investigating them the big fish will all lawyer up even more than now start intimidating the little fish not to testify and start destroying evidence.Garland is too busy going after fist fights on airplanes.Executive Privilage.Donald Trump is an absolute disgrace to America.\s\sA sitting president who has tried to turn the country into an autocracy.\s\sThe evidence is clear but the Republicans continue to support him no matter what out of pure political strategy.\s\sA shame and something that could set a dangerous precedent for America.Unfortunately none of the Trump supporters or any Republican voter will ever even know of the existence of the PowerPoint because Fox and all other right wing propaganda will never mention itThey're continuing to support them because there's no reprocussions and they have no honor. All democrats left right and center need to stop pretending republicans are operating in good faith.That's sedition that's a federal crime. Trump and everyone involved in this attempted insurrection must be tried and punished. Failure to punish this will result in a civil war.Here is the power point\s\shttps://web.archive.org/web/20210716135230if_/https://www.ingersolllockwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/voter-fraud.pdfAnd slide 15 is proof positive of what several of us have been raising the warning bells about for 5 years\s\s""2010 - Democrats (Sanders and Warren) raise concerns""\s\sA quick reminder that their ""concerns"" were ""how dare Bernie lose by 3 million votes! I'm gonna make up a narrative instead of accepting the obvious"". Proof of what we've been saying that Sanders and his supporters claiming the 2016 primary was rigged gave the Trump administration what they've never had: credibility.

Last time I checked neither of them support dictatorial power grabs instituting elements of fascism in the United States or threatening/alluding/fantasizing to kill members of Congress. Do Democrats care about democracy or is it just more fun to chase people into the restroom?You do realize Sinema and Manchin are part of the LEGISLATIVE branch not the JUDICIAL branch right?I don't really know what Manchin and Sinema have to do with ending democracy. \s\sAlso chasing people into bathrooms is rude but this is important.

You could ask Bush too they were funding Al Qaeda in 2007 after the new Shiite gov in Iraq purged Sunnis in Baghdad and the Saudis got worried that they would become strong allies with Iran. Just ask any president since Vietnam basically. The answer is no penalty as long as it enriches big military industrial complex otherwise it’s straight to Guantanamo. (No constitution in sight)I feel like these types of stories and media attention just gives Jones more power and credibility to his followers. He's not going to jail for thisYou're 100% correct. Whether it's positive or negative press coverage they just need to stop covering these people all together. One of their biggest talking points is that the media is out to get them and they use these articles as fuel to the fire.Yes it’s just stoking the hatred Americans have got each other.Alex Jones is a crackpot seditionist scum. I know those words are intense but he's just another person using their platform to prey on the vulnerable while sowing division confusion and destruction in the lives of millions. It's up the people to come to their senses and walk away from these charlatans and purveyors of provocation otherwise the fabric of the nation itself may soon unravelThe Trump cultists won't walk away.

Of course I'm disappointed again.Not even s little bit.I wish I could say I was surprised but the fact that his entire 4 years in office was a grift and his entire administration was a bunch of crooks and unqualified dingleberries I'm really not surprised that their Covid response was an utter failure too.\s\sSo much failing so many lies worst administration in US history worst president everThey did! The sticky note is floating around somewhere.Trump: I hereby order you to do something about this virus\s\sAdvisors (yes-men): Very wise plan Mr. PresidentTrump wants people to die of Covid. Total psychopath.my take on it is that maybe maybe his admin had an outline of a plan but trump shredded it to make Joe look bad.Trump's vaccine distribution plans are right next to his beautiful new healthcare plans.\s\sRepublicans should be ashamed of themselves.Republican party is a death cult. They are also anti science. They believed that herd immunity could be achieved and set on down that path.\s\sMost my conservative acquaintances have never uttered one word about the 400000 deaths from covid.Why would he? Only 5 people ever caught it......The vaccine was already being distributed. My wife and I already got our first dosesTrue if the administration liked you you got what you needed if you were on the naughty list you had to fight for it remember when he said he was going to release the second round / supply there wasn’t any they’re using the first round to also give the second shot I think it was like like here’s your vaccine have fun with no definite outline /plan for down the road.What causes tremendous danger is Trump and GOP Congressmen continuing the lie that Trump lost the election due to fraud.  Everyone continuing that lie is guilty for anything that happens.Reminder vote up to make this seen more.. of course we don't support Trump sabatoging the post office to cheat on the election but not a reason to vote down which will  only hide thisI've gotten mail in ballots for years. I usually walk it into the polling place to drop in the box.OK if I post my take on the USPS sabotage that i've copy/pasted in a few posts? (pre Friday Night Massacre)\s\s----\s\sThis travesty is much much more than merely closing branches and slowing mail to disrupt the vote. \s\sHere are a few reasons trump* appointed the acting PG who is a major campaign donor with zero experience (acting because like many many other 'acting' cabinet and department head positions trump* knows Congress will never approve their appointment)...\s\s* They want to eliminate or disrupt absentee ballots because with more people able to easily vote it means trump* will lose by a landslide.\s\s* They want to reduce efficiency so they can privatize it because of a lack of efficiency through a no-bid contract to the highest reelection campaign donor 'bidder'/Mar-A-Lago member - which translates to kickbacks (campaign donations) which equals legal bribes!\s\s* They (trump*) wants to fuck with Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon the biggest client of USPS but more important Bezos owns the 'fake news' Washington Post who reports the truth about the presidential criminal enterprise for pulling stunts exactly like this one.\s\sAmazon is the biggest client of the USPS.  So big that the Post Office delivers their packages on Sunday - the only mail delivered on Sunday.  Amazon customers who are used to 2 day delivery may now have to wait up to a week or more and may decide to shop elsewhere.  Maybe some Amazon packages 'get lost in the system' and never delivered...\s\sBecause trump* hates Bezos so much he is willing to disrupt one of the oldest (1792/George Washington) and most efficient departments of the USA Government just to fuck with Jeff Bezos.  Let that sink in...\s\s* And maybe *the most important reason of all* - '**TO OWN THE LIBS**' ! ! ! ! !*\s\s----------\s\sThe new Postmaster General is Louis DeJoy.  Since January 2020 DeJoy has donated $360000 to President Trump’s re-election campaign and roughly $70000 to the Republican National Committee.  He was appointed in May 2020...  \s\s(if you do the math he donated over $86000 a month/over $2866 per day to buy this job that pays $291650 per year...)\s\sNow you know the price for trump* to sell the job to someone with absolutely no experience.  Let that sink in and realize that he sold every other high level position under similar circumstances - Mar-A-Lago members bribed trump* to get an 'acting' position with no experience...\s\sThey spend much much more to get the job than the job pays.  Think about that...\s\sWhere is the return on investment??\s\sDeJoy and his wife have over $70 million dollars in holdings in USPS competitors UPS and J.B. Hunt Trucking.  Shouldn't this be a conflict of interest?  If he makes the Post Office flounder in inefficiency don't you think people will migrate to UPS and his package delivery services??  \s\sOh his $70 Million dollar package delivery company received $700 million dollars in stimulus funds...\s\sOH WAIT he is the 'acting' PG so he is beyond scrutiny.  It also helps that Barr & the DOJ & the judges and Mitch & the Senate are in trump*s pocket so in effect there are no more checks and balances in American government anymore.\s\sWhat trump* is doing is incredibly heinous!  Yet he eliminated every option of watchdogs...\s\sFunny how that works out as well as all the oversight committees stripped bare and gagged.\s\sThis new crony sees no problem that all the mail does not get delivered every day (like forever up until now) and it is OK that a backlog is compounded every day week month year...\s\sAlready a daily priority ranking system has been assigned to determine the importance of each envelope or package and how timely it should be delivered if delivered at all.  Priority Mail is no longer a priority First Class is an old term for dependable mail...\s\sThe acting Postmaster General and trump* feel it is wasteful to pay overtime or hire new employees or keep all post offices open or budget for infrastructure improvements or tune up/update the trucks to ensure every day that:\s\s""*[Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds](https://www.federaljobs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bigstock-Mail-Man-During-Snow-Storm-In-58944299.jpg)*""\s\sThe new slogan should be.

There was no effort to analyze or investigate the workings of the Postal Service and hold meetings to address the 'supposed' shortcomings.  It was a trump* demand to [put a stick in the spokes](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/016/674/802.jpg) to sabotage an efficient government agency for a reelection scheme and also to stroke his ego and fuck with his 'fake news' enemy.  \s\s* Oh and 'own the libs'....\s\sThis shit show has the trump* smell all over it he just needed a lackey to be manipulated like a marionette.  This new guy is the new darling at Mar-A-Largo and in trump* subreddits...\s\sAt this point in the trump* administration he knows he can get away with anything he wants because he knows he has Barr & the DOJ & the Judges and Mitch & the Senate in his pocket and they will never go after him.  Plus he dismantled any oversight and checks & balances.\s\sIf this was a legit administration there would be immediate questions if all of a sudden the Post office exhibited the slowdowns and problems that the public are complaining about since the new puppet took over.  \s\sBut trump* is silent about these new shortcomings he maneuvered the USPS in a position that only helps his reelection tactics and also screws over Jeff Bezos and the public.  Oh and *own the libs*.\s\sHow much in campaign contributions do you think it will take for trump* to privatize the USPS and 'sell' it to another Mar-A-Lago donor shell corporation?\s\sIs anyone surprised??\s\s__ _ _ _ \s\s\sWelcome to the new trump* dystopia...\s\s\sWe are in Step 4 now!\s\s----\s\s\s\s\sV O T E ! ! ! !Wow he said the quiet part out loud. Even the Dr. Evil knew better than to do that in the Austin Powers movies. Seriously though what Trump is trying to pull here is dangerous and people can't ignore this. He's coming right out and telling everyone that's he's willing to do whatever to stay in the White House. Add to that Kanye's apparent stalking horse campaign & the news around that and it speaks volumes.

I don’t care how I just care he’s goneAre they positive he’s gone?I wonder what Devin Nunes' cow is going to do...Does he expect to get paid?He's trying to milk a new cash cow after his old cow made fun of him.You know damn well he won’t receive one red cent of money too lolHe will end up in jail.In thoughts and prayersSo... Devin Nunes is going to be the front-man/fall-guy for Truth (TM).  It's almost poetic.Can a Democrat replace him?This is the only thing that matters.What Democrats should do is start looking for centrists willing to run as Republicans and help them out. At least make it difficult to just re-install dumb/crazy people.[deleted]No its in a very trump dominated district.  Tulare County.Very very unlikely. Devin was in a safe red seat.Ole Nunes may have jumped the gun there since it’s being investigated by feds now.Nunes is probably more kompromised than Dana Rohrabacher. His move to Trump’s company is practically an admission that they’re both all in with the international mafia. The sketchy billion dollar investment just confirms it. The whole thing is a giant flashing neon sign for a national security risk.So…if trump somehow wins in 2024…will he be allowed to run his businesses including this new one…like he did the last time?Of course who’s going to stop him.  America!Does the Democratic Governor get to replace him until the next election?No that's only for the senate. Special election would be the only way to fill the seatA seat badly needed by Democrats. It would be glorious to see that seat flipped after he quit to take a job where he will be suing Trump in 9 months for not being paid.Not likely. Have you ever been to Visalia? It’s like a big chunk of Kentucky appeared in California one day.The next Con to be elected to that seat will likely be as big or bigger P.O.S.*Stares at Cow account* … any response?A good start.  Just need to get rid of all the other corrupt republicansThat was easyI hope this is true but the only thing I want to know is how the fuck did he get out of being indicted for all the bullshit he was involved in during the last four years with the despicable douchebag Donald? Before you said I know the AG was a dirty bastard but what about now they can definitely look back on what he did and possibly indict him but then again I'm not too fond of AG Garland either I think he's soft and he may even be a little scared to really do his job I think they need to get a new AG in there a seasoned AG that's not afraid to indict and convict.Great. Can all of Trump's bitches leave office so people with integrity and a spine can take their place? Obviously it's wishful thinking that we won't end up with someone worse but I can dream.Oh this is gonna be good.

I’m liking this trump network idea more and more. Surely he has a job for Ted Cruz and those two q quack ladies?Does that mean Newsome can appoint a democrat in his place?Will Russia/Putin have to find another fine representative to lobby their efforts?So much for public serviceWell of course grifters attract grifters.\s\shttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-06/who-just-gave-trump-s-spac-1-billion-let-s-find-out\s\s>But there is a another and more consequential worry in all of this. Trump is a former occupant of the Oval Office and is likely to make another presidential bid in 2024. He had his hands on the national security apparatus once before and may well again. The identities of the investors who just tossed $1 billion his way are of interest because anyone able to buy their way into Trump’s good graces by plopping a bag of money on his desk could sway public policy — which makes Trump a national security threat.\s>\s>What might it mean for example if countries such as Saudi Arabia or others in the Middle East have decided to invest in his venture? That’s not an entirely hypothetical question.Perfect! Everything Trump touches turns to shit.King Donald is a comedy of errors. Evil intent with no fear.

Well here we are.  Unfortunately this is a precursor of the coming years.  We are going to see an era defined by domestic terrorism.  Thank you Hawley.  Thank you Cruz.  Thank you Mitch.  Thank you Collins.  We're the shithole country now.*sigh*....just why?It's time for normal Americans to occupy their Capital's against domestic terrorists.they were really obsessed with ruining him to the detriment of everything else.Thats how the republicans feel about democrats right nowYeop. And Democrats didn't do anything about it.Republicans need to be destroyed.at the ballot box--he said completing his thoughtMade me think: what if they developed a new kind of case to impeach the entire Republican congress as a whole?CorrectBy whom? The Democartic party! Thats funny. Fucking funny.The Republicans fought everything Obama tried to do. It’s amazing he was able to get any type of healthcare passed in that environment. Yes the ACA requires some fixing but it’s 100% better than anything the Republicans put out there.How republican of them.Imagine how much money could have been saved if we'd spent a little bit up front on prevention.\s\s\sInstead we've got a $2 trillion stimulus and more coming.\s\s\sGood work tea party!YES!--Then  those same tea party types complain about goverment spendingGOP = DEATH CULT.That’s bc Republicans literally want Americans to die. That’s the only reason why they blocked this bill. Obama wanted to save lives from a future pandemic but Republicans said nope these people will die and we won’t care!!It didn't matter what PBO did  McConnell was there to obstruct then bragged about his obstruction. Let's kick every GOP up for reelection to the curb in Nov. starting with Mitch.Besides the fact that the GOP views politics as an us against them bloodsport they also hold this ridiculous belief that the government should be run like a business....complexly ignoring all of the things government does to protect businesses(and society) from failure.What is wrong with these people?  We have to live our lives in fear and don't get to have any fun because of them.Most of the really meesed up things in politics start with the Republicans. There are of course messed up things with Dem but they pale in comparison with the Republican crap!I am Jack's lack of surprise.The Republican machine is chumming the waters by exploiting Russian propoganda and this virus. What do Democrats do? March out Joe ""Groper"" Biden as an answer. What does Joey ""G"" say in response to the President's television bonanza? ""Ehhh mmm"" <ppphhtttt>. In case you didn't understand that's an ancient old man shitting himself in a nursing home.\s\sThey're going to win in 2020. Columbus Ohio and Landsing have proved that they are just to mad dog to overcome and Democrats aren't up for the fight because they're fucking pussies THANKS Hillary!dont care i am voting for joe bidenWhen you tell your supporters that they are being cheated it lays the justification that cheating is permissible if not necessary.  Just like when you tell your supporters they are victims it provides the justification for them to victimize others and discriminate.  The entire Republican platform is premised on this culture of false grievance and projection.  For example look at the conservative response to BLM.Their problem is well Republicans have lots of problems but the Problem they are trying to fix  Is That they are a **minority** That's why they keep trying to make it harder For everyone else to vote Because they are worried that people are going to start to treat them like they have been treating minorities all these years.Just like it also justifies the voter suppression tacticsWe saw the conservative response when January 6th happened with support from the GQP for it.\s\sI don't know a single democrat/left leaning person that hasn't condemned any and all violence in BLM protests.  Besides we have plenty of proof that right wing agitators showed up to cause trouble.  Umbrella Man is the main one.  https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/28/896515022/minneapolis-police-reportedly-identify-viral-umbrella-man-as-white-supremacistJeffrey Epstein & Trump we’re friends & photographed together but somehow Dems are the Pedos in Pizza Parlor basements…?!?!  Same swapping of the Voter Fraud switcheroo He who smelt it dealt it!Trump literally told voters in north Carolina to vote multiple times.NC here. Many did>""In every listed indictment and conviction for voter fraud or other malfeasance in connection with the 2020 presidential general election when the culprit’s political affiliation is known he or she turns out to be a Republican or “unabashed conservative.”\s\sRepublicans lie. Republicans cheat. The only fraud in the 2020 election was done by Republcans.No kidding.  This is why Trump was shocked he lost.  He thought he had the game fixed.  With his Postmaster General not shipping out ballots or delivering the ballots that were filled out on time.  The voter suppression tactics.  We had personal experience with the ballot mailing shenanigans.  Even Fedex was slow delivering ballots.  Huge campaign contributor to the Republicans by the way (Fedex).  Lots of BS pulled off by the Republicans that got ignored because Biden won.It's always projection with republicans!\s\sWhenever a republican complains about something that republican should be investigated for it.Who farted?🤭**G**aslight **O**bstruct **P**rojectque the spaceman meme. Its always been projection. Bang. AlwaysIndividual instances cannot usually turn an election but wholesale disenfranchisement by cutting back on mail-in ballots registration days and voting hours and places \*will\* turn races. The GOP clearly no longer believe that 'all persons are created equal'. That's very sad.  \s\s\sOnly our votes can exclude them from office please do not waste yours.The GOP has NEVER stood for equality.Whenever a republican blames Democrats of doing something I see that as projection and it is the Republicans who are really doing that.💯I have a personal example of this; my wealthy Texan MIL knew her two daughters weren’t republicans so she filled out their absentee ballots herself and threatened to cut off their college tuition if they said anything.Um... You can report that and probably should. Voter fraud is a federal crime.Report her.Is it any surprise that the people who spent a century telling each other that cheating is easy are getting caught cheating?Always accuse your opponents of the nefarious deeds you yourself are perpetrating.  It's been the Repooplican MO since Tricky Dicky.That's what I've been saying every time people said ""There was no voter fraud!"". Projecting is what they do all the time.Hey how about we look into the KY ME and SC senate elections from 2020 with a fine tooth comb? Where there is smoke there is fire.This is part of their grand scheme to make it harder to vote. It uses aspects of the Frank “TJ” Mackey “Seduce and Destroy” system.\s\sTechnique 1: “Form A Tragedy”\s\sTechnique 2: “Puttin’ On A Fight”\s\sThere was no widespread voter fraud so they had to make it happen themselves by sacrificing a few rubes.Yep they used to hate immorality and Govt spending until Trump was accused by 24 women of sexual misconduct and he ran up $8.4 trillion in debt too. They don't hate immorality and govt spending it depends on the party doing itAnd this isn't even talking about the electoral fraud Republicans love so much as well.To the eyes of Jesus everyone looks like Jesus however to the eyes of Satan everyone looks like Satan. \s\sAny Republicans voters claim that they are Christians but are they? Perhaps they follow the rule of SatanNo way. I don’t believe it. Fake news.Colour me surprised/sI for one am shockedThey truly believe dems do the same things sans evidence. Ain’t projection great?Doesn't matter they control the media so their voters will never hear this.Democrats are bleeding heart liberals who don’t believe the ends justifies the means. They aren’t going to cheat.Donald Kirk Hartle intentionally voted under his deceased wife’s name was fined $2000 and given probation. Crystal Mason who attempted to vite using a provisional ballot because she wasn’t aware she was ineligible is going to serve 5 years.\s\sWhat the fuck?\s\sIf intentional coordinated mass voter fraud is really the issue the right says it is these guys should be made an example of.I would expect more of this in 2022 and beyond. Becuase to some of them they will think ""If Democrats do it so should we.""And the Dem leadership in Washington really needs to hammer this point home.  They also need to push for stiffer sentences.  If these cases are related then RICO cases need to be prosecuted.EVERY ACCUSATION IS A CONFESSION!I KNEW IT!!!! (Not really I ASSUMED)That was the worst answer imaginable for that question. It was the honest answerFraudian slipAnd... donating to Bernie. I thought I was a democrat but seriously?

Her argument was that the unpledged/super delegate system protects *grass-roots activists* from having to compete with well-known elected officials over pledged delegate slots. It's the exact opposite to what the headline is claiming. \s\s>DWS: ""We are as a Democratic Party really highlight and emphasize inclusiveness and diversity at our convention and so **we want to give every opportunity to grassroots activists** and diverse committed Democrats to be able **to participate attend and be a delegate at the convention**. And **so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn’t competition between them.**""\s\sHere she is on with Bret Baier on Fox answering the same question:\s\shttps://youtu.be/RFZtyOTAC6E?t=145\s\s>DWS: ""In a primary in a caucus the candidates come out of those with pledged delegates who are bound on the first ballot to support the candidate that earned that delegate. Unpledged delegates are our party leaders and elected officials who actually can make up their mind at any point and change their mind.\s>\s>**We separate those so that we don't have elected officials and party leaders running against the activists who we want to make sure are helping to diversify our convention.** That's something we take great pride in. A native american. A cancer survivor. **Those people should have an opportunity to be delegates too and they shouldn't have to deal with very well known elected officials and party leaders and that's why we separate them.**""\s\sIt may not be a particularly good argument for the system but that doesn't negate the fact that it's ridiculous for so many people to be outraged over something she never even said.I don't think I could possibly conceive of a worse answer to that question. I guess she gets points for honesty though? No in this case honesty fails.This is a Republican blog spinning her words and then quoting yet another Republican blog (Hot Air) further spinning them. DWS inartfully said the exact opposite to what the headline claims. \s\sShe's arguing that giving giving super-delegate status to elected well known party officials (for example Bernie Sanders is one) allows regular pledged delegate slots to be reserved for grass-roots members of the party to compete over. She's saying the grass-roots is being protected from having all those slots easily gobbled up by professional politicians with name recognition.\s\sIt may or may not be a reasonable explanation but it's clearly not anything like what these right-wing blogs are claiming she said. She was asked to explain a long standing arcane party primary mechanism that she had nothing to do with putting in place.Wow... Seriously? You're defending this? [deleted]Just read a plethora of your other posts. Good work you. Very good responses to many points. You've done a lot of homework. >“Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don’t have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists. We are as a Democratic Party really highlight and emphasize inclusiveness and diversity at our convention and so we want to give every opportunity to grassroots activists and diverse committed Democrats to be able to participate attend and be a delegate at the convention. And so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn’t competition between them.”\s\sDid she really say these things? maybe you should read the article and watch the videoHow many ways does this ignorant piece of shit think of to cut his fat orange nose off to spite his spray painted Halloween face?

Also the cut off to stop paying social security is something like 150000 which is ridiculous.I think it’s better to have a cap on paying in and paying out like they do now.

Not only do people care about his opinion (as well they should he is a candidate for president right now) but many agree with him.\s\sShocking to you I know.Clinton's comments are not shameful. What's shameful is O'Malley being on a high horse. He used 9/11 to talk about the Bush Tax cuts (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9117-2005Feb8.html) \sAt least Clinton's comments made sense and were honest. I can't say the same for O'Malley's arguably equally odious commentary. \s\s*That being said* I'm all for a dialogue of different opinions but I really dislike all this negativity in the comments. I think what people have a problem with is that she really dodged the question and changed the topic completely. Thank's for the down votes guys. Y'all are classy :)Great! All Trump did was lie all he does not is lie.  He needs to be held accountable for his corruption.It doesn't matter how blatant the lie his followers will never accept the truth even when it's right in front of them.I didn't realize anybody didn't know this...The answer to MAGA What Is Truth?  You can't handle the truth?  The truth is what they say it is you are all wrong...No surprise here.basically Donald J Trump is just lies.Remember Miles Taylor? He also said the same.

Free speech is one thing but this is open sedition and should be punished accordingly.

Give me a break.> can be ordered back to active duty and then be court-martialed under the UCMJ\s\sCitation needed.Treason. Slap his ass back in prison. For good.I’ll never forget how republicans turned their backs on the constitution to protect Trump.....I don't get this sentiment. Republicans have never cared about the constitution...or states rights...or shrinking the deficit...or law and order.\s\sThey care about power and exerting that power to gain more power. I think my point is that this behavior is not surprising at all.A pretty accurate indicator of how many actual ""conservatives"" are left in the GOP who have not been radicalized by Trump into anti-democracy anti-Constitution cultists at his beck and call.Party over country... yet the Dems are the unpatriotic ones.  \*Insert the most gigantic eye-roll here\*Lucky for them they mostly see Democrats as enemies of the country.Leasership character and honesty are values that are weak and diminished already in politics. These people could careless about Trump. They have a party firmly in his grasp and they pay fealty to him merely to protect their own positions and status.\s\sAs long as there is a bigger nut job waiting in the wings willing to firmly place lips to butt for the Trumps they will stand pat. Until those who vote Republican finally sour on this man...their representatives won't do so either.I'm shocked its that many to be honest with you.This is like the statistic ""50 percent of people admitted to lying in the past and the other 50 percent were liars.""538 gives dems a 69% chanceNice.Personally during a Presidential election cycle I can't get enough polls.  They're so exciting and always spot-on!That's good sarcasmHe’s been saying it for a long time.Adam Smith in the ""Wealth of Nations"" says: “The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents therefore would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not perhaps be anything very unreasonable. **It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense not only in proportion to their revenue but something more than in that proportion.**”\s\sThat's where Buffet learned the truth. It is taught as a fundamental in graduate economics and then ignored by the Ayn Rand types. But they aren't capitalists.Ayn Rand is HyperCapitalist. And Buffet who promoted health rotting CocaCola forever isn't exactly a paragon of virtue. Capitalism is primarily Concentration of Wealth which means State Oversight of Capitalism is necessary. Call me a Commie Leveler perhaps but actually I like Competition in business with moderate profits with high taxes on extreme wealth.  Much of our recent economic gains are a result of Government investment: Computers (1940s thru 1960s). Interstate Highways (Suburbia) Technology (Space Program). Those three alone were primed Not by usually Republican Rich people but by Government! DARPA anyone?

I see Trump is no different.Your demands go unheard here trumbo boy now go cheat at golf you worthless sack of 💩.I couldn't believe him plugging the opening of his L.A. golf course on twitter on thre day the death toll topped 80000. Literally doesn't have a soul this man.Projection from the President to rally his stupid gun toting supporters to violence.If you count on the census and of age your vote should countYou do know that children are counted on the census right?It does not matter he would lose California either way He is just trying to change the news. Again.It does matter down ballot though.Let’s keep the statistics statisticing(yes I made up that word)but you know what I meanMail-in ballots shouldn’t count. Now poll-cast ballots shouldn’t count.

The end of terms are hard and fast and the blue states won't let him on the ballot a third time.Over on r/conservative they’re advocating that CNN and MSNBC be banned from reporting on the White House.  It’s funny that the “Party of Reagan” is pretty much demanding Pravda at this point.But Obama?!Sad thing is... theres not much we can do. The only thing we could do to stop him is to get him out of office by voting Biden in. \s\sBut... the democrats are pretty split right now from Bernie dropping out. This is going to be a 2016 dejavu where people are not gonna vote thinking that theres no way trump is gonna win. People are not gonna vote because Bernie isnt the one running and the only passion they had was for bernie. \s\sAnd by people I mean democratic people. I wouldnt call Republicans people at this point. They've sold their soul to satan so I'd call them little shit turds.[deleted]It’s true. We had been lucky that the boy king had not had to face a true national emergency.   That luck ran out.Only he is still president.  He still has authority he is still in charge and he still has the full support of his party.  \s\sI read the article and I see his point but nothing changes for Trump.  He'll just keep in lying while people die and his supporters will just blame the Democrats.  Or gays or abortion or whatever.  And when the election rolls around he is not guaranteed to lose.  And if he loses he will not leave peacefully.  Nothing is over.As long as he can blame everything on brown or black people his minions will support him. They will support him as their farms and businesses are foreclosed as their jobs vanish the stock market (and their savings) crumbles as Russians call the shots on foreign policy as America's reputation abroad disintegrated and even as their children's education and health care are dismantled.  They will support him because they hate people of color more than they love their farms businesses savings Country and even their children. \s\sHate conquers all.Trump could fool around with a prostitute in the White House bump into “the button” accidentally launch a nuclear attack on Mississippi and his supporters would still insist “Trump is doing a great job.”They said Hillary would whip him how did that turn out we need all my brother and sisters from Bernie's campaign a large black and brown turn out  suburban woman's vote to win in the electoral college.One can only hope.His failures need to be condensed into devastating 30 minute campaign commercials by the Democratic nomineeYes. Or regular 3-5 minute video’s each depicting a different issue. Because concentration span and a general “what the hell will it be this time” feeling.>The coronavirus is quite likely to be the Trump presidency’s inflection point when everything changed when the bluster and ignorance and shallowness of America’s 45th president became undeniable an empirical reality as indisputable as the laws of science or a mathematical equation. \s\s""Surely this will be the end of Drumpf"" says opinion magazine that has been cramming this article in between their daily ""innocuous thing you enjoy is actually problematic"" clickbait for the last 3 years.Pretty good chance he has the virus.

I say yes. And I’d be willing to bet that the GRU gave Trump a clear advantage. The Trump circle met with Russians over 100 times.

Plus Stacey Abraham and Asian Coalition in GA are working hard to register them to vote. They gain ten of thousands but I am not sure its enough.Looking like Perdue’s chances are better. Depends on turnout and moderate voters who could split the ticket.Want to help the Lincoln Project?

MERRICK GARLAND HAS TO GO AS AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND BE REPLACED WITH A CAREER INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS WORKED AT THE DOJ FOR SOME TIME WE NEED AN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT  WILL INDICT SOMEONE NOT PUSH THE CASES TO A GRAND JURY TO DO THEIR WORK AND IF MERRICK GARLAND DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR HIM TO INDICT THIS GUY THEN I DON'T THINK HE'LL THINK THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN ANY CASE AND IF WE ARE LUCKY HE WILL PUSH THEM OVER TO A GRAND JURY.I disagree.

Not really on the up-and-up of course but not exactly the bombshell misconduct it's being made out to be.\s\sWe need to keep in mind that 1) it's not really clear how much if at all this hurt Bernie.  He always had and relied upon his own fundraising infrastructure which partly because of his status as an Independent caucusing with the Democrats (rather than a true Democrat) was wholly separate from anything impacted by this revelation.  That 2) Hillary had long since been the party's presumptive nominee and was nearly unanimously agreed-upon by the establishment. Her sole opposition had merely *caucused* with the party and his campaign was never meant as anything more than a protest by his own admission.  And that 3) this was in return for paying off the $24 million of debt the party had been left with by President Obama.\s\sNow I'm not saying this isn't naughty but the question is really *how* naughty.

Officials from Hillary’s campaign had taken a look at the DNC’s books. Obama left the party $24 million in debt—$15 million in bank debt and more than $8 million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign—and had been paying that off very slowly. Obama’s campaign was not scheduled to pay it off until 2016. Hillary for America (the campaign) and the Hillary Victory Fund (its joint fundraising vehicle with the DNC) had taken care of 80 percent of the remaining debt in 2016 about $10 million and had placed the party on an allowance.\s\s>The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that **in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC Hillary would control the party’s finances strategy and all the money raised.

They'll be begging to be a part of the United States again because they can't tax their people to fund a war effort or secure resources.Not really cuz the stupid half is too poor and sick to pull anything off. This is more like a ""if I cant have it noone can"" mentality where they drag the whole country down with them.did not some vacationing facists try to takeover congress around this time last year?Democracy is dead in America. The fact that an outgoing president can openly lie about election fraud that doesn't exist and incite an armed insurrection to overthrow democracy and illegally and unconstitutionally reinstate himself as a dictator without being immediately locked up for life or publicly executed means there is no future for democracy in America.The bad part is the DOJ seems to be sitting on its hands and not doing anything about this.  Why are Trump and his ilk not indicated already?    They have enough to get them on and that includes the ones in Congress who were part of it.  \s\sThey let them get away with this then next time it will be much worse.  They keep saying January 6th was only practice.  The Democrats are so weak.  Just like Obama did not prosecute Bush and his crooks.Not just face no consequence he is the front runner againAnd the best part is that it's based on a complete fabrication. What a sad time we live in where a man's fragile ego can destroy the strongest democracy in the world. Democracies are easily broken.Trump gave every indication long before the election that if he did not win he would not accept the results.  Yes he is a dictator and he still has a following and control over the Republicans.And that fabrication is that actually democracy has been lost the democrats have stolen it with fraud. We need to counter their fascism with our own fascism.I do not know about a civil war but we are heading for the end of our democracy.   We are heading to authoritarian fascism.  The worse type as well; National Socialism (Nazism). \s\sWe have a worthless Democratic party which does nothing and a weak worthless president who does not want to do anything for the people either.  It will be hard for the Democrats to win anything since people will not want to vote for them.  The Republicans have a cult and their base will always vote for them even when they do nothing for them.\s\sWith such a weak opposition party and all the problems in this country and a good chance all the bubbles the FED has been inflating the past quite a few years the economy will also be bad.

Trump and his ilk should be in jail by now but there seems like nothing is happening.At this point if there are no consequences then it’s going to happen again. The only reason I can think of that trump reminded us of at his rally - massive “protests” with a lot of people exercising their 2nd amendment.

Lie.Right wingers supposed to go to work and do their job no matter how bad . What happened to that?You'd think that if they were really as demoralized as they claim then police officers would be demanding something like more mandatory paid time off reduce the time they need to qualify for retirement (i.e. 20 years instead of 30) mandate that their departments give them mandatory psychiatric care/annual evaluations etc.\s\sBut we're not seeing that.Maybe then they weren't cut out to be cops.They really should put a limit on how long someone can be a cop. Cops become jaded and carry a lot of baggage of the stuff they have dealt with. They carry that into every interaction they have in and out of uniform.I say I wish they wereWell when the mayor of Chicago Seattle and Baltimore all attest to cops leaving spreading their departments thin due to budget cuts I don’t think police are all in this conspiracy theory to say that they are all struggling. This labor statistic you folks are using is a bit misleading.  \s\sFirst of all it is probably true that cops aren’t leaving all police departments on a broad scale. It is also true as this articles states is that there are some departments that are struggling due to budget cuts and when departments are struggling with budget cuts that affects personnel level and when there aren’t enough officers that delays response times like they attest to in the Denver police department. \s\sSecondly it states that 4000 police officers overall left the profession. When you talk about 0.9% of 600000+ law enforcement officers that’s still a significant decrease especially if those losses are concentrated in larger departments with higher crime. This doesn’t even take into account to those who have left and rejoined other departments. \s\sOne way to interpret this would be that larger police departments in cities like Seattle or Chicago are losing officers while smaller police departments are making gains - as it states in this study -  https://www.policeforum.org/workforcesurveyjune2021\s\s“The reduction in hiring was relatively modest with a 5% overall decrease in the hiring rate among responding departments. Smaller agencies actually saw an increase in hiring while larger departments experienced dramatic reductions. “\s\sLook I understand it is pleasing to ourselves orient our views in destroying a common enemy. And when we do that we become blinded by our biases. But on the left we really need to do better in approaching this police brutality issues because it is one we absolutely suck at.Since the cops in Chicago avoid any kind of work a smaller force wouldn't have that much of a impact. \sThey put a lot of effort into destroying the trust of the public.

It's basically whoever's in power complains about the party out of power dragging their feet and using the filibuster. \s\sLady time republicans have the majority Dems used the filibuster 300 times.Everything republicans want to do they can do through reconciliation.

I remember Joe's podcast with Jack and Tim Pool that was a good one.My guess it's the same reason YT ended up promoting flat earth and other conspiracy content. An algorithm designed to maximize user engagementFuck it I’ll stereotype. I think right-leaning folks are much more likely to get sucked into rabbit holes and to believe things without any evidence. Particularly rabbit holes about conspiracies pseudoscience or anything that will tell you that the people you don’t like are pedophiles and drink the blood of children. \s\sThey’re just more likely to entertain fanciful and easily-debunked ideas.

You people are delusional.This is literally cancel culture. \s\sThey basically fired him and ready to take him to court for providing medical opinion. \s\sSince that opinion isn't shared by the state they canceled him. \s\sThe irony.I thought cancel culture wasn’t a thing?>Orange County Medical Director Dr. Raul Pino wrote an email to staff on Jan. 4th encouraging them to get vaccinated and boosted for COVID-19.\s\s>In it he wrote “I have a hard time understanding how we can be in public health and not practice it.”\s\s>In an email to WMFE the Florida Department of Health has confirmed Pino was put on leave because “the decision to get vaccinated is a personal choice that should be free from coercion and mandates from employers.”\s\s>**Florida DOH says it’s even conducting an inquiry into whether any laws were broken by sending the email.**\s\s>Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has banned vaccine mandates in the workplace and the state has seen a surge in Omicron cases.\s\sEdit: *Don't Look Up!*Wow so not only does the GOP want no mandates they also don’t want public health officials to even encourage vaccinations? That’s fucking nuts.That’s false news actually Florida has had a 10% in omicron cases over the weekend.As a Florida resident I say GOOD!!!Once again the right canceling people.I mean he is a doctor basically giving medical advice.  WtfIronicI for one only trust doctors that support my point of view. Agree with me smart doctor. Disagree? You’re a quack.So you won’t support or take advice from a doctor that tells you you have “this condition” just because you don’t agree with him ? Conservatives are a weird bunchThis is literally what the entire Democratic Party has been doing with every doctor who disagrees with them lmaoo you fucking idiotCancel culture at its finest!!!!Encouraging isn’t quite the correct word here after reading the email. \s\sMore like a — mentally exhausted and annoyed plea to get vaccinated.the funny thing is DeSantis thinks he can actually win the election. Literally zero chance. If trump wants to run again he will literally streamroll that shit brain.Whats odd is the guy has a medical degree from a school in a Banana Republic how did he get that job?Why would he be arrested for that?The invasion was a crime that sets a bad precedent?He shouldn’t beI assume that people calling for it (read: random people on twitter) think that if his claims are true he should be held responsible for the damage he helped facilitate. Whats more people are still in the dark about the executive branch's involvement in the riot. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest the riot was intended and helped to be moved along by people surronding the president. This coupled with congresses inability to put out a final cohesive report on the subject has left a lot of people with a bad taste in their mouth.If you fund ISIS or other terrorists such as the ones who stormed the Capitol then you can be arrested for funding terrorism.Fuck Alex Jones he is nothing but an absolute scum bag who preys on others weakness.  He scares vulnerable people and then he sells them bullshit to make MONEY $$$$.  He lies everyday and he is a fat drunk mother fucker.  He only cares about the MONEY and being in the spotlight.What makes you think people don’t want to buy bullshit?Submission Statement: Video has resurfaced of Jones on Jamuary 6th claiming that he paid half a million dollars to january 6th rally organizers and was asked by the Trump administration to lead the march on the capital. This coming a month after saying Biden would be removed from office ""one way or another"".[deleted][removed]Actually you certainly can arrest and charge someone for seditious conspiracy... which is exactly what happened and is in fact still happening with Trump and his claims of being resident again ""sooner than you'd think"" ie not legally.\s\sThey pretty openly talked about going to washington...""getting wild"" and ""stoping the count""LMAO who's calling for it?  The r/politics crowd.  GTFO.  I'm so sick of the r/politics posters who come here and post this fucking rubbish.It's actually so funny how retarded and wrong you are.  Let's check out where OP posts.\s\sOP has 11 posts:\s\s5 are in /r/joeRogan\s\s1 is in /r/askUK\s\s1 is in /r/askTrumpSupporters\s\s1 is in /r/whatIsThisThing\s\s1 is in /r/conservative\s\s1 is in /r/libertarian\s\sBut the best part? A post they made to /r/banned with the title ""banned from /r/politics"".  They are LITERALLY FUCKING BANNED FROM /r/politics HOW FUCKING STUPID CAN YOU BE.\s\sIt's almost comical how fucking retarded you are.\s\sI'm so sick of the r/conspiracy and /r/conservative posters who come here and post this fucking rubbish. Why does it seem all right wingers have room temperature IQ?Alex Jones is a National treasurelol Joe Rogan repeating that over and over again dosent make it trueNational Treasure 2: Book of Secrets maybe. What a shit movie amiright?Not enough to silence him on every major platform and throw dirt on his name they want to arrest him too? LolWhy do you think you feel the need to defend this horrendous human?[deleted]So Newsweek makes articles by quoting a bunch of tweets?The US was governed via tweet for 4 years.  Now it's unacceptable?There seems to be a lot of that in printed media.But its ok to donate to the bail fund for blm and antifar/republikkkansArrest him! Make him a martyr. It will surely calm his supporters down.By that logic we should just let any crazed scumbag break the law with impunity? \s\sYou are dumber than a dodo bird and crookeder than a crooked penisAs if he has $500000 USD in cash.Is that so crazy? The guy is loadedyeah well i remember ""calls for the arrest"" of Hillary Clinton too and they were just as retarded as this and they will be about as successful as thisSo if you donate to a political demonstration and people at that demonstration do something illegal you should be thrown in jail?

Fuckin haoles!What in the actual *fuck* is and ARMED PROTEST?[deleted]This but unironically. We definitely need more authoritarianism in this country. We need to go back to the 1950s when people like this were put in asylums.\s\sBefore I get accused of being a ""leftist"" put them in too.I'd laugh if that wasn't such a likely response from this adminYeah this shit feels like it’s just getting started unfortunatelyHonestly I have a feeling it’s fizzled out. The capitol riot was their big lightning in a bottle moment and they blew it. There will probably be separate small independent incidents but nothing again in those numbers and organizationSo I grew up in a really conservative small town but moved away after high school. I'm in a group chat with some of my friends from there and it's my main way of keeping up with what the average small-town Republican thinks about current events. After the election one of them was saying ""at least we aren't going to riot like the left does when they lose"". Lol that comment aged terribly.Eh sounds more like activists desperately trying to capatalize on “momentum” or some shit like thatEven Alex Jones has had enough of these people. That says a lot.Just getting started? There were armed protests and even the annexation of entire blocks; it's been going on for so long that who gives a fuck about one more?? Defund the police amiright?It is.Hopefully Congress treads lightly when it comes to gun control.Lmfao...NOW the FBI is stepping in? LMFAO...Got caught with their pants down have to save face now.Actually the FBI has been telling them of domestic threats for a while its up to those in power to actually do something. Its obvious that they are simply ignored.anti-american BLM terrorizing cities for and killing cops for months straight wasn't bad enough.\s\sAngry USA flag waving patriots is worse.Spoiler it was always alphabet glowiesThe Qanon shit is really ingrained deep in American society. It occurred right under our noses but the boomers fell hard for a 4chan prank that spiraled out of control. There's a reddit forum of family and friends of people who fell hard for Qanon. The common theme is that the husband sister parent etc that they once knew is gone. And replaced by a Qanon Trump worshipping cultist.\s\sVery scary stuff. I'm a firm believer that this really is just the beginning. Something will happen and people in the police or military will have to choose who their aligned with. And when you have the president saying constantly that elections was rigged the country is being taken that you must use strength to get it back and also with the Q shit reprogramming people.. There's a recipe for disaster here.Shit's a virus of the mind.It's known now there was military personnel and off duty cops at the Jan 6th riot. This means there will be a split within the institutions themselves. Mutinies and rebellions in the military and law enforcement. Soldier vs soldier officer vs officer. That's like the closest thing to a civil war that I can fathom.\s\sAnd all for....fucking Trump? I've studied authoritarian movements and their respective leaders. All of them are insane usually have a criminal background already. But they also were rather intelligent and well spoken. Trump is one of the most mind numbing people to listen to and he isn't even charismatic (to me). How people rallied behind this man will be a forever mystery to me.Its almost like normalizing right winged conspiracy theorists is a really fucking irresponsible thing to do.\s\s...It's more than a 4chan prank out of control.  Someone has weaponized that shit to do exactly what it did.I kind of doubt it but it would make for an interesting airport novel. I think both sides of the extremes are the only ones that perpetuate this “super duper scary” doomsday scenario but in reality most of us are reasonable. The capitol riot only had what like 2-3 fatalities out of thousands of nut jobs who were crazy enough to protest? Same with the BLM riots that were supposed to destroy the country[deleted]lol the other day he called himself a liberal. I wonder what planet he thinks we're on that we're that retarded.[deleted]I love how raging this will have him but he knows he can’t speak his mind fully on the matter or will lose podcast viewers. I fully expect him to make jokes about the Capitol ignore the fact they murdered a police officer say the woman that was killed shouldn’t have been and call Biden senile.It wasn’t the “TEXAS IS RED WOOOOOO. I’m not a republican” that did it for ya too?Being a trump supporter is the new 'in the closet'Yeah but Gavin newsom ate at a restaurant. So he's 1000x worseOk. I came to this sub to try to find someone talking about this. \s\sHas he said **ONE WORD** about the riot??\s\sI've listened to every episode since then and haven't heard him mention it. It is so clear that he is avoiding it. It's the single biggest story in the world right now and not a peep from him.\s\sEdit: make this comment before listening to today's episode with the drug guy. Glad he at least addressed it but doesn't really make much sense that he intentionally didn't watch any of the videos given how much he talks about watching stuff like that.[deleted]So I’ve listened to the podcast a few years and Joe never came across to me as a Trump supporter. If anything a he seems to be a person that doesn’t see politics in black and white. Either I’m stupid or you are talking shit.I think he has realized his folly and doesn't want to utter anything for the fear of fuelling the frenzy of the right wing nut jobsAnd undercover FBI agents are leading 45 of them?I guess everyone has forgotten the FBIs long track record of masterminding and then thwarting it’s own terrorist plots.I don't know what they have to complain about. \s\sAt some point they will relax and actually realize Trump was President for 4 years. He did it. He actually was President.[deleted]The same thing the Not My President protests were about. Whining that they lost and reminding the other side there's an opposition.Has Glenn Greenwald confirmed this? We only believe him around here.Perfect opportunity to declare Marshal Law for a narcissist...MartialOr were you referring to his dog?Ahh yes Marshal Law... the final lesson of Marshal Arts.Which would be perfect time for 25th amendment or removal by the Senate.Lmfao so they’re planning to start them?I really love this joe rogan related content.most American's can't even name all the state capitols so this is fake newsGettin real tired of people posting articles in this sub that have literally nothing to do with Joe RoganI don’t know politics is a big part of the show.And I’m getting real tired of armed thugs coming to my town to start shit but here we are.I'm sure they'll be as ""mostly peaceful"" as all the armed riots I mean protests last year.""i knOW yOu aRe BuT wHat Am I XXXDD""\s\sThanks for putting that lack of self reflection on display for everybody boss.It's truly terrifying to see that these people really do believe civil war could (or should) be their course of action. None of us are prepared for the amount of suffering that would come of it.It seems a good number at the riot were ex cops ex soldiers active soldiers and off duty cops. Unfortunately I think they ARE aware and they want to do it anyway. Because they are also mentally unstable.Where’s Mr. Joe “I know how this ends” Rogan now?He's at home waiting for his sauna to heat up. When the temperature reaches 180 degrees he shouts ""Texas just went red WOOOO!""Just remove 'united' from the countries name at this point. That shit from a few hundred years ago was clearly not resolved beneath the surfaceWhat % of the Republican party does Vanilla ISIS represent?\s\sOr did the Republican party become the Trump party?\s\sI kind of think Trump is through with his political aspirations.  He's got a bunch of debt coming and his brand is tarnished.  He's always going to have revenue from his MAGA merch to sell to his loyalist followers but I doubt that's going to be enough.\s\sI wouldn't be surprised if he moves out of the US like he promised to do before he lost.What does this post have to do with joe rogan?There have been [armed protests](https://blavity.com/armed-black-protesters-of-the-not-fking-around-coalition-hold-demonstration-at-georgia-park-denounce-the-kkk?category1=news) for literally months; this is no different.except they just tried to overthrow the government.\s\sBut sure they both have groups of people with arms and legs and noses and stuff so they're the same in that regard.The Canadian FBI?The Canadian FBI??Isn’t that legal though? Like especially in open carry statesI don’t think sedition insurrection & murder are legal anywhere.  Please correct me if I’m wrong.Whatever happens will be staged and perpetuated for a reaction and tighter restrictionsIt really wouldn't be /r/joerogan without you crazy fucks lmaoYou’re saying no matter what any sort of violent event will be staged?I tried to check [gab.com](https://gab.com) to see if the Parler refugees were making noise about it but it's not loading for me.  I suspect they're being accidentally DDoSed by the extra traffic that Parler's closure has caused.I really wish people could just stop. They’re cutting their noses off to spite their faceSounds good.@joe\sDid you criticizes those white mobs yet? Or is BLM the one you are comfortable talking about. \s\sI am starting to see double standards.He's not gonna read this dawgRemember when he brought reggie watts on the clear the air about how black people feel  and proper ways to protest. And then that other black guy I forget with the dreads to talk about the same thing. No issue with either. But I understand the timing of when they came onIt's almost like the people whose leader has been silenced by orwellian tech companies have now had their own identities stolen had their own voices silenced and have been routinely labelled ""nazis"" and ""white supremacists"" for the past 5 years are pissed off. Who knewYou mean the people wearing shirts that say 6 million wasn't enough?\s\sGood point. I guess we forced them to wear that when they stormed the Capitol.He’s the president you fucking moron he hasn’t been silenced. He could walk out on the front lawn and just start talking and it would be broadcast all over the world.Nothing of consequence will come of these. Unlike in DC all 50 states’ governors can activate their respective national guard without approval from the Trump administration. DC’s mayor could only request that the DC guard be activated and the Trump admin said no.I don’t think it’s remarked enough that Trump effectively declared war on the people of DC by doing that.  Why?  Because we never liked him and he saw us celebrating his defeat.I THOUGHT IT WAS ANTIFA???As long as they are protests what's the big deal?Gee I don't know what happened at the last one?Ok I'm waiting for the Democrat governors to lay the hammer of god on these protestors like they did this last summer with antifa/BLM. Oh wait.whats with this bad faith talking point that all you repeat like racists parrotsBLM protests were overwhelmingly peaceful with cops being super shitty.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThis is an attempt at an overthrow at the government. BLM wasn't.I thought like 6 months ago the entire country was founded on the tenants of white supremacy and we were fire bombing federal buildings and cities to take down the racist government systems and evil cops? Now Reddit is full of patriots. Lol. \s\sThis wasn’t an attempt to overthrow the government last week it was a group of protestors fueled by biased sources and conspiracy theories that was escalated by a minority of participants. Which is exactly what we have seen for almost a year across the country. Mobs have been attacking federal buildings invading restricted access at the White House burning down DC buildings looting and killing people for almost a year based on debunked conspiracy theories and now it’s a problem. \s\sThe only good thing about the MAGA rioters is that they actually limited their insanity to capital hill. Those are the people actually responsible for the mess we are in. At least they left the innocent public alone unlike what we have seen in the past few months.What was their goal?So America let’s people get away with rioting for months on end killing people and causing millions in damage. Now is suddenly when a group of morons don’t like how something went and throws almost exactly the same paddy. You lot are fucked up and deserve each other. I’d be looking into immigration myself. Maybe Mexico will let you in.Oh you mean like the kid traveling to a different state and killing people? Or you a bob the builder type and you gonna cry about buildings?[deleted]Good we still have the right to protest. \s\s\sOr are liberals openly against that now too?Look this IS CNN!lmao gtfoOverthrow the government* \s\sWinners*Okay...go invade Trenton. See how that works out when you make gang members unite.[removed]I thought The Onion was about making fake news stories.  Is internet broken?There is a newish modus operandi for cons- if something happens that doesn’t benefit them politically or philosophically they take to the airwaves instantly and start spreading horseshit. Like the Texas grid being caused by renewables. Arsonists creating fake fires in Australia and antifa being behind the Jan 6 insurrection. \s\sAnd let’s not forget joe himself putting out misinformation that antifa actually started wildfires in Oregon and California.When Joe was spreading the blatant lie about Antifa start fires in Oregon a bunch of militants created their own armed check points and were stopping people on the road harassing them.\s\sJoe never talked about that fucking shit when it happened he kept his mouth shut.  He was totally fine though spreading an easily verifiable lie.It ain't newish. Regan blamed the ""welfare queens"" minorities and ""communists"" for everything wrong in the world.That’s not newRepublicans don’t solve problems or speak the truth. Ever.It’s the P in GOP:\s\sGerrymandering Obstruction and ProjectionInstead of fixing the energy grid and holding those behind the disaster accountable they banned abortionThat doesn't fit their narrative. Global warming is still a lie to them.Damn. You right and will get downvoted by Muricans so hard sad. Have a +1When was the last time an official from Texas didn't gaslight the public when it came to the source of an issue and how long will the electorate let that slide?Always remember: republicans are garbage and only weak people who obey men who lie to their faces vote for them.But for real thoughNaw. Can’t be.Welcome to TexasNeed beautiful clean COALr/politics is that <-------- way...fruits.Shut the fuck up and stop acting like Rogan doesn't dabble constantly in politics.Ohhh fruits an old skool classic!! Cry more.It’s Texas news.  Joe loves Texas.  \s\sYou just hate hearing bad things about republicans.Wind power completely failed.  That wasn't the cause of the problem but it certainly showed wind is not the answer.You're so close. Let me help you.\s\sGas power completely failed. That was the cause of the problem and it certainly showed that gas is not the answer.[deleted]Lol. Good god man. It’s just impossible for some people to hold their to account for their fuck ups and blatant lies.Respected Site “here’s a report on what happened. Hold your government accountable”\s\sDsta997 - “fuck you ted would never do me wronggggf”How? Are you just retarded?This sub is so strange now it’s all people who hate Joe and the best comment/controversial comments are the same lol I’ve never seen this before in any sub.This was posted in r/libertarian and someone said if you read what Kavanaugh actually wrote about it it is very sound legal reasoning.  He then provided some links.  Kavanaugh has been a very respected person in the law community because of his sound reasoning and unbiased opinions.\s\sEdit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/9jmyga/reminder_that_kavanaugh_once_ruled_that_an/?st=jmnnvThank you for this. Instantly when I read the title I knew there was more nuance to the situation. B-but Orange man likes him!!  This is why democrats hate him. They do not want a person on the court who will interpret the law as written they want a person on the court who will legislate and interpret the law in a way that pushes their political agenda. This is the result of decades of an incompetent congress who are too afraid to pass laws (aka do their jobs) because they are afraid it will affect their chances of getting reelected.Reminder that Kavanaugh once ruled that an American citizen could be disappeared and tortured in a CIA Black site and had no legal recourse against the US government. Remember this when they speak about the rights of the accused[deleted]Nice show of racism. Would never expect that from one of y'all.So you're saying it's okay to form conclusions of guilt based on the available evidence even if there hasn't been due process and a court of law has not determined guilt?\s\sCan we do that with Kavanaugh too?I don’t think he represents my interpretation of the law: He is anti net neutrality He has sided with religious extremists on a few issues and doesn’t seem to view healthcare the same way I do.\s\sThe cherry on top is when you look into his role in the 2000 Bush Florida recount... pretty sketchWhat effect has the repeal of net neutrality had? r/quityourbullshitJesus if Putin could see this thread he would be laughing at his successful division of the country through trolling [deleted]OP stop with your bullshit. This is so inaccurate it's hilarious.Did he choose that ourcome or apply existing law which reasonably led to that outcome?orange man bad!My favorite today You need to do more researchRemember that's how the law was written blame the law not the judge.Democrats are in favor of ~~black~~ sites of color that's why they didn't bring it up. Rahm Emanuel's Holman House is one good example.So.. I'm confused. Are you pro rights for the accused or anti?\s\sIt kinda seems like your pro rights for the accused if they are someone caught up with shady terrorist activity in a known terrorist hot spot but not pro rights for the accused if they are a well respected white male judge who has a pretty squeaky clean history?You Trumpanzees are pathetic. If that same asshole was nominated by Obama you idiots would hate  him. You people are so transparent. A hundred bucks say that all of these pro-Kavanaugh posts were written by white male  Trump voters. \sI’m so glad that you people will be outnumbered because there sure isn’t any enlightenment of you.  Being white or male or a voter does disqualify one from being a Democrat.Holy shit bro they were about to win me over. Thank you for warning me that they might be ""White males"". That completely changes my POV on the situation. /s>A hundred bucks say that all of these pro-Kavanaugh posts were written by white male  Trump voters. \s\sWell not necessarily. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov over there in St. Petersburg can't actually vote for Trump and I'm sure there's a few of them around. Sure does a great job bamboozling the rubes though.  Can you prove it's the same people or we doing anecdotal? Also you do still know white is still the majority race right? So you may be half right there considering realism. Btw trump supporters or people who just dispose the left are a 63% majority on aproval ratings and just so you know... you brought up trump about a rape case wow good on you liberals for having any moral. You prefer to hate a orange guy than be legitimately concerned for the victim or the accused. I seriously hope you learn to grow up. Kids don't get officials elected and that's prob why trump will be 2020 just because peope (majoriry) are tired of your nonsense.I haven't been following the case too closely but just happened to see the court hearing earlier in the week. He acted like moody teenager getting a speeding ticket being lectured by his parents. I don't think I want someone like that in the highest court of the United States. Have to agree with you here. Every time it was brought up I defended the guy because the whole thing is ridiculous. Then I saw him speak and I got a very weird feeling. I was really worried about this until I realized I'm not  conspiring to blow up shot or commit general mischief.  So much better now I know this!Well the funny thing about that is there doesn't have to be any evidence that you are. That's the beauty of the Patriot Act - the mere suspicion is enough. My favourite part was Obama's ""We tortured some folks"".I don't trust any of these rich white politicians"
