That Jewish guy that talked about the galactic federation. Someone translated parts of his book. He talked of a 3 crashs he knew of or has been to. One in Germany and one in the grand canyon that was on the floor of the GC for over 2000 years. The last one was a arrow shape craft that crashes years ago and someone took the back half of the ship. Prob the engine and left the rest of the as a wreck. I can't find where I read the translation but it's out on the internet. Oh he mentioned some skeleton body's at one crash and another with no trace but claims the aliens in the grad canyon one prob lived with the natives. Happy searching.Check out Skinwalker ranch.

It‚Äôs a good oneThere have been multiple attempts at offering millions to anyone who could prove scientifically they have these abilities... and every single one has failed.\s\sIf it is true... it would had been proven.Oh brother. Read the gateway report. Literally any mystical faculty humans can conceptualize seems to show efficacy.Also even if it did make those claims id be tempted to just interpret this as ‚ÄúThe CIA is fucking stupid and thinks psychic abilities are real lmao.‚ÄùRussel Targ worked with and trained the CIA folks way back when. he wrote a pretty cool book about it and has a Ted talk too. It was interesting. Some of his stuff is a bit out there but also keep in mind he sounded like a pretty accomplished physicist. He worked on lasers etc and a few labs. He tends to back up claims with research and offers his own quasi reasonable explanation or theory he has about how a phenomenon he found works.I had the pleasure of attending an RV workshop with RUssel Targ.   It was personally pretty mindblowing.Just watched this presentation on physicist Russel Targ‚Äôs research and experiments with ESP for the CIA yesterday!\s\sVery cool to listen to although in this talk he doesn‚Äôt really say anything about any explanations for the ESP or RV phenomenon just gives examples of experiments that show it‚Äôs a real thing that happens. They apparently just don‚Äôt know how it works yet but tests show it‚Äôs real. Here‚Äôs that link:\s\sBanned TEDTalk about Psychic Abilities | Russell Targ | suespeaks.org\shttps://youtu.be/hBl0cwyn5GYThere‚Äôs a great documentary on Prime Video called ‚ÄúThird Eye Spies‚ÄùI‚Äôm going to check this out. ThanksLike I‚Äôd trust the CIA to do anything right except run drugs.and topple governments.Bet they seen this one coming.They already saw what you did there.Russel Targ- remote viewingYep... it's called the Gateway experience. You can find the actual documents and transcripts from the CIA website. Here's one of them:https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210016-5That doesn't say anything useful.project jediFor nothing but cold hard FACTS I always turn to MEDIUM.COM.theyve known this semi-publicly since the 80s.Earlier. RV was being used for cold war intelligence gathering by the Russians if you believe it's a real thing. Apparently our Govt. did.They are a primal trait before we could communicate with words. Dormant and when they are active they are a splinter in a thought. It‚Äôs like trying to find a unique singular grain of sand on the beachfront coast line.I thought this was all just junk they made up to trick the Russians into pouring money and time into pointless research? That's what I heard anyway.\s\sI mean I believe in Psychic abilities but not to the extent that they can be weaponized by the military industrial complex. They serve a different purpose and anyone with them will have a very bad time if they try to use them for harm.The problem they have is that for clairvoyance to work the human being needs to develop themselves their whole selves (body soul and spirit) to attain a reliable level of mastery. They can't do this because any human being that does the work necessary to achieve this level probably didn't do it under the watchful eye of the CIA.\s\sThat is why they hijack all other groups (American Theosophy for example) that claim to be able to achieve what they want. And if they are using their clairvoyant power for personal gain they will be misguided by the spirit world. It is extremely hard to find truth in the spirit world and the only way to be sure of discoveries in that world is to have moved forward ethically and morally as an individual. Black magik is always tainted with personal ego and greed and will work in a crude fashion but of course it swings back and bites them in the ass. I bet they have learned that lesson quite well by now.I‚Äôve recently finished Annie Jacobsen‚Äôs Phenomena which delves into this area in good detail. If anyone is interested in finding out more about how TK and ESP were developed and some of the let‚Äôs say.. unique approaches to its applications; then I highly recommend it.this book is really good and i need to reread it. that said in her Area 51 book she also claims that Roswell was a soviet experiment to try and infiltrate American air space. while i don't think she's being disingenuous she's one of those authors who ""wants to believe"" just as much as we do and therefore anything that isn't declassified/verifiable shouldn't be taken as concrete evidence of anything but instead a bread crumb to do your own research and come to your own conclusions. otherwise love ms. jacobson despite her semi-reputation among normies of being a crank.Heisenberg's uncertainty principleI dont know why youve gotten downvotes.... \s\sI've wondered myself if this comes into play.   To expand that theory: if a large population of consciousnesses hold a common belief system does that belief then manifest in some way?To meth or not to meth? /sYes I‚Äôve also read Area 51 and whilst I enjoyed the content around the developed of the Oxcart program I have to say that the whole ‚Äúblack propaganda‚Äù tale of medical experiments and flying saucers was a little hard to swallow. She has proven herself to be a tenacious researcher and I certainly feel she should be given more respect for the information she‚Äôs managed to collage. I‚Äôve got Operation Paperclip slated as my next read from her looking forward to it.I don't believe it for a second.I always feel sad for people that dismiss the right-brain strenghts in humans.  The idea that the left-brain serves as a filter of logic for the right brain it would seem that some attributes of the right-brain instinctual emotional 'animal' attributes could be overlooked by too strong a left-brain function for some folks?Have you ever tried prediction or remote viewing yourself?

Not sure which is funnier‚Ä¶I'm still convinced our ""conciousness"" is just the aware end of a filter and that there are a bunch of other small sub consciousness' going on one or more which are telepathic in nature.[deleted]I read a while back this happened in movie theaters.Jacobo Grinberg a neurophysiologist at the University of Mexico also did experiments regarding the transfer of information non locally from person to person with the implication that all consciousness is connected.non locally as in they were in their houses or diff parts of the country or something?Does this have anything to do with spontaneous synchronizationSynchronisation of weakly coupled oscillators! Could definitely see brains or consciousness in that way.How they sync may not be what we think though but maybe a pathway beyond our current thinking. \s\sBut when we do the same things our brains might use the same parts others do to complete a task. Those who think and are similar ‚Äúminded‚Äù people.Being on the freeway moving at 90 mph and everything is standing still‚Ä¶ glance over at the guy next to me and he‚Äôs singing the same song on the radio station I‚Äôm listening too‚Ä¶ a river of dinosaur blood flows through our cars high fructose water in our belly‚Ä¶ we are all in synchronized chaos it‚Äôs beautiful‚Ä¶You do realize that petroleum products aren‚Äôt actually made from dinosaurs right?Is this why I never seem to feel included/in sync with other people? Are we incompatible and we just can't understand each other properly.You might be an Apple in a PC world.You needa find ur tribe my guy they're out there and probably into the same hobbies you areThis is fascinatingThis is so interesting! Thanks for sharing.Ishtak Bentov's ""Stalking the wild pendulum"" explores this phenomena as well as other aspects of consciousness great book.  He posits that we all emit EM in the same way wires emir EM at right angle to election (or hole) flow and this induces current (sympathetic) in those we are close to.  That and a fair amount of wave propagation and interference patterns round out his theory as it relates to shared thoughts. Brilliant man.energy is what we are then>Neuroscientists needed to rule out the possibility that this neural synchronization occurred due to a shared environment similarities in sensory input (what people could see hear smell) or in motor output (how they moved their bodies).\s\sRemember kids correlation is not causation. And not everything that's unexplained is paranormal.And water is wet thanks. Given that this is a scientific study nothing paranormal is being suggested here.\s\sOn the other hand what is interesting is that a complex systems theory of consciousness has the odd side effect that locating consciousness purely in the brain isn't necessary and that could have effects that further study could uncover.\s\sOr you know just sneer at anything that isn't the generally held purely dualistic ghost-in-the-machine model of consciousness that hasn't ever been philosophically or scientifically logical.This seems rather obvious. If people are in the same environment and talking about the same stuff it seems rather obvious their brain waves would sync. They both sync to the shared causation thereby correlating with each otherLol thanks for these great words you‚Äôve assembled. Does the possibility it is paranorm make you uncomfortable.\s\swhat part of the scientific method is ridicule.Yes but all causation is correlatedPersonally it amazes me how the menstrual periods of women who live or work in groups eventually synchronize especially when they work together in confined spaces such as an little office or classroomthats a mythThen I suppose it would be appropriate to describe people with autism or aspergers as having brains that don't sync.Maybe they sync in different ways more or fewer ways with ‚Äòneurotypical‚Äô people;     \s.. or only sync with other people running at their same.. uh.. ‚Äúlevels‚Äù for lack of a better word.If only I had a better receiver installed. I don't get enough stations on this thinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDhlOovaGrIRed silhouette on the right and blue on the left I see what you did there.Could explain a few thingsConsciousness is a fieldA couple of months ago I had a very normal dream (nothing strange or awkward about it that is) where a good friend of mine told me that his wife was pregnant. We had talked about the possibility of them trying at some point a few times but that issue had not been a topic of conversation for several months at this point. I thought it was such a strange and random thing to dream about that I told him about it. When I told him about the dream he didn't say too much about it...just said ""*That is very strange*"" or something similar. At the time I did not notice him having any strange reactions to me mentioning my dream. Well a few weeks ago he broke the news to me that they were in fact expecting a child.\s\sThe crazy part was...he said ""*Do you remember a couple of months ago when you told me about your dream? We had just found out she was pregnant about 2 days prior to that!*""\s\sThere was only one plausible explanation I could possibly think of. Obviously when one finds out they are going to be a parent that concept completely dominates your thoughts for quite some time. The ONLY thing I could think of was that he was putting so much energy into thinking about it and was putting that energy out into the universe and I somehow subconsciously picked up on it and I just knew what was going on. He said it really freaked him out when I mentioned the dream but he didn't say anything at the time because it was so early in the pregnancy and they wanted to get further along before telling anyone.\s\sEither way we spend a lot of time together and I personally believe that we are synched to a certain degree and he subconsciously and unintentionally ""told"" me what was going on. This world is a wild wild place.I had a best friend through high school and after where we were inseparable. It was a very happy and healthy friendship. Over time it definitely felt like like her and I were starting to have our consciousness join together. \s\sWe got on a hallucinogenic adventure and used them every so often. We synced our watches to the second (usually when we were apart at that moment) knowing they'd kick in the perfect time once we came together. \s\sWe ended up sharing hallucinations constantly. Also thoughts and feelings. And not just ""it's cold"" .. ""whoa I'm cold too!"" type thoughts and feelings. Completely obscure random things at precisely the exact moment as each other. Our perception of things around us in all states became almost the same. \s\sI know how types of shared coincidental thoughts can become common amongst people who spend lots of time together like spouses. My parents do it. What my friend and I experienced wasn't like that though. It sometimes felt like there was something silently communicating between us. A link somewhere like a tether between us that grew one day unbeknownst to us. A little extra connection that formed. It was a wild ride.Merging minds and consciousness‚Ä¶ for sure.\s\sDid you ever have any telepathic experiences with her?   Perhaps where you were apart but ‚Äòknew‚Äô something about the other one‚Äôs situation that was confirmed later?Oh rrly?\s\sPeople have ""vibed"" and ""synched"" since humans built fires.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sTry again doctor guy humans have behaved this way for generations.But now he‚Äôs proved it with a lab coat![deleted]I'm not into dosh I hate money I *loathe* possessions. It''s just so...crypto-fascist!Good stuffOn acid your mind literally connects with other people to the point that they can say only a couple of words that don‚Äôt make sense to the average person but the tripping person will know exactly what the other person is saying. It‚Äôs a crazy experience and I‚Äôve had multiple people who I‚Äôve met that have said the same thing happened to them.This synchronization may well be the explanation for the experience of a ‚Äúcontact high‚Äù when a sober friend is present with a few others who are flying on the same substance and the sober friend starts to feel ‚Äòlifted‚Äô in the same ways they are.\s\sAnd possibly how friends & partners can ‚Äòsense‚Äô or ‚Äòknow‚Äô or ‚Äòshare‚Äô information with each other irregardless of distance syncing up at the same moment.   Partly enabled by experiences of syncing empathetically / cooperatively when physically together and developing a deep familiarity with each other‚Äôs patterns.      \s  Just a hypothesis.\s\sThe ‚Äòextension of consciousness‚Äô idea has been expressed by others from a different angle:  \s\sWhen using a tool such as chopsticks a fork or a pencil‚Ä¶ you can notice that your attention and awareness moves *to the instrument itself*.       \s.  You don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhow‚Äù to write a character with the pencil or even ‚Äúhow‚Äù your hand needs to move  you think ‚Äòas‚Äô the pencil simply knowing where the tip needs to flow to complete the letters you are writing or shapes you are drawing.\s\sThis suggests that using attention awareness & perhaps a little bit of imagination we can ‚Äòput‚Äô our consciousness in other locations:  the tines of a fork  the tip of the screwdriver turning a screw  the edge of your kitchen knife as you cut vegetables.   \s\sAnd perhaps further afield.Could might...so it's nothing.This wouldn‚Äôt be surprising imo. Obviously it seems humans produce some level of electrical activity that would effect the ether in some way if even only small ripples. It‚Äôs also easy to assume that these ripples could be absorbed and effect the background noise of the brain in some way.\s\sSo I think it‚Äôs a reasonable hypothesis to think they could form a harmonious feed back system.\s\sWhile it might sound unreasonable. It‚Äôs seems just as unreasonable to dismiss it as pure nonsense.Does that explain why people have the ability to ‚Äúread minds‚Äù??? I‚Äôve always looked at it as more of a sync between the two subjects allowing one individual to ‚Äúhear‚Äù from the others subconscious before the other individual has the chance to say it. It‚Äôs telepathic communication it just appears to us like some form of super power due to the fact 99.999999% of the time we use some form of spoken/written languageSort of I guess... funny to look at considering this sort of thing being existing for a long time.\s\sLOL funny the way they then say ""give up consciousness does not exist"" stupid. No. Consciousness objectively exists. So then I think it's just as valid as saying ""ok you are an unconscious person"" lmao oh so it's possibly true? Like how some papers cooked up this to say it was?\s\sEdit: it probably stands higher now though that you have articles actively broken by journalists saying things like: consciousness does not exist. Then a companies actively promoting this fraud too. Along with journalist writers... really really scum.On a salvia trip a few years ago with a buddy of mine we were laying on the couch and our shoulders touched and we both described the same visual and emotional experience it was literally like we were morphing into one conscious being.**Strangers**: Read the rules and understand the sub topics listed in the sidebar closely before posting or commenting.

And before you beat me up are you prepared to believe the spaceship also rained hellfire on the text below?Love the comment section community.Yeah I didn't pay much attention to the stains because it's super much clear for me this is just from rust or damage these things happen to paintings after some time. But for the heck of it these flying THINGS motifs are so weird...The disk looks like a rondel on a 15th century cuirass and pauldronsWhat do you think about the ufo thing. It looks like some sort of portal and a face with a nose looking out of the portal. Lol. I really do see It.Looks like smoke billowing out""Clearly"".Yea...a good post ruined by his shitty personal statement.text underneath is german psalm 130.7 ""israel hoffe auf den herrn"" which is translated to ""O Israel hope in the Lord""  \s\s\sdon't seem to be directly connected but maybe of interest.definitely interesting...thanks for the infoJust a weird thought but..\s\sWhat if disk-shaped ufo theories were actually inspired by these paintings rather than the painting being evidence of ufos?\s\sLike what if angels were depicted like weird otherworldly disk object things for a long time before they changed it up and started painting humanoid angels and the baby cherub things. Then later on people forgot the connection or people from outside the religion/culture interpreted them differently thus creating an idea/theory of flying disk objects without proper explanation or background. Then people began seeing (or imagining) flying saucers just like many claim to see angels/demons/ghosts/etc. Then someone came along* in the early years of aviation and actual* flying machines and created/solidified the modern idea of flying disks into the sci-fi alien vehicles we picture today.\s\sNot trying to argue or disprove or anything. Just some thoughts I had while looking at this[deleted]I know what sub this is and I dont want to be too critical because we're supposed to be open to possibilities and all that.\s\sBut that red stuff is damage due to age and the UFO is meant to be like a representation of an angel or chariot of god type thing.Is it noteworthy that a common classical artistic representation of a godly chariot so closely resembles the modern observed UFO phenomena?[removed]a chariot that doesnt look anything like a chariot....How do you know what the UFO is meant to represent ? Could it mean it represents a UFO ? wtf. An angel or chariot lolIt definitely appears to be decay related damage OP was overdoing it with that interpretation.\s\sAs for the object unless some art major has some revelatory explanation of what it actually represents then it literally is a depiction of a UFO (it's unidentified and it's in the sky).\s\sIf it is meant to represent an angel or some heavenly event then it is curious how much it does resemble modern descriptions of UFO's (it even seems to have a trail or plume of smoke attached to it).\s\sIn saying  that without more info about the painting it's all idle speculation.Honestly I wish most users of this sub would think more critically before and after posting to it.\s\sWe barely see any proper strangeness just stuff that can be or has been explained or debunked.Not saying it was aliens but clearly its aliensYou forgot the hairLooks to me crashing into a church. Looks like its on fire to or upside down. Or it has a smoke stack for a boiler?And from the bible I give you  [Ezekiel 1:4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin19zki_3rAhUKNOwKHSO1AFoQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fezekiel%2F1-4.htm&usg=AOvVaw0Vn7l6ypsbTSQ5ZlJrG_mp)\s\sA rather stunning thing to find in that book.annoying people were drawn as snails in european medieval times. You know there was a certain picture language used. But for the heck of it I can't find anything about what these THINGS IN THE SKY could mean. Maybe some holy shine from angels or the sun but ffff they look SO much like flying saucers.Because you look at them with eyes and mind of 2020. Back then they didn't had movies and popculture to ""know"" what a spaceship is supposed to look. But they had the bible. And the bible gave them the must fucked up angel description you'll ever read.It looks like it is shielding the church from a meteorite.I second this. I think it‚Äôs meant to portray a stylized shield protecting/saving a church from lightning or maybe a meteor. Shields were most likely a more common sight and reference point for people in the Middle Ages. Our 21st century eyes think ‚ÄúFlying Saucer‚Äù - a 16th century church goer would recognize the object as a shield.This resembles a similar depiction on a French coin from the same time period. https://images.app.goo.gl/uXXR3uTAQHqkGzwZ7 \sAnother example:\shttps://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/03/20/31D1DFB000000578-0-image-a-10_1457038614429.jpg This one has been suggested to be Ezekiel‚Äôs wheel but compared to the first coin I‚Äôd say they are all shields. One can basically argue a flying saucer and shield are the same thing.Maybe their word for ""vehicle"" WAS ""chariot"" - that would make a lot of sense to me.Looks like it depicts a UFO crashing into a church. Would be really interesting if there was anything documenting that.\s\sEdit: past this of course being obvious documentation as in something in writing like a narrative.Why is everyone focusing on the on fire thing. OP obviously looked at it and saw something else initially. That absolutely does not take away from the fact that this is a painting from hundreds of years ago depicting a church and UFO connection. If people stopped wanting to be ‚Äúright‚Äù they might actually see the big picture now and thenYep. It's called nitpicking. The fact that artists one day up and decided to represent god/angles/chariots as flying metallic discs should be of high interest considering the historical and modern contexts of sky beings and flying machines.Ah the sixteenth century UFO's had such wonderful lines and classic styling... /sYou guys should join this discord server.

If you want to I can ask my family about it they come from around there.[deleted]Probably Ezekiel‚Äôs wheel in the sky from the bible.Someone should carbon date the paint. I wouldn't put it past the elites to re-write history and include aliens just for shits and giggles.That's a weather balloonThere's also this painting of Madonna with children in Pallazo Vecchio Florence that shows a UFO in the background and someone watching it and pointing towards it. \s\s\s[ufo Madonna painting ](http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/03/04/a-ufo-in-palazzo-vecchio/)Setting fire or coming down to save it?That UFO looks a lot like a trencher. A trencher is the bread they used to bake to use as a plate. Sopped up all the drippings and you'd feed it to the dogs. This is just an observation. The artist was probably familiar with that bread and used it as a reference.The UFO looks like the Living Alien Ship from Encounter at Farpoint. \s\sAssuming that it is a UFO and  assuming the church is on fire one could argue that the UFO is coming to the rescue of the church. Wait that is also the plot twist of Encounter at Farpoint.So that‚Äôs who‚Äôs been doin it.You mean the shell being used as a lamp?  How is it setting fire to a church?  That‚Äôs missing paint not a laser.\s\sI think let me look again.\s\sEdit: YES! Missing paint.Awesome find I've seen so many UFOs in old paintings but never this one. It looks like the cover of a pulp novel.Although what looks like smoke and fire on there could also be blemishes?I know this is not the interpretation you're looking for but almost definitely the artist was depicting the interaction of the divine/the Holy Spirit with the world and not a ""UFO.""If the ‚Äúdivine‚Äù is a saucer shaped craft how is that distinguishable from ‚ÄúUFO‚Äù?you know art existed back then too right?Wait a moment there was a DOMINICAN Monastery in ROMANIA ?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I want to believe that these beings are visiting earth but come on!Couldn't it have been their depiction of Ezekiel's wheel?that looks painted on top of itThe script seems to say ""Israel hope for the Lord"". Not too sure about Israel but it would make sense if they meant people of israel as in god's chosen people.So what if the first translators translated wrong?? Then forever no one will know the truthEven if that were fire there is little that leads me to believe the UFO started it.\sShame about the title here.  But keep the cool ancient UFO art coming folks.The Ophanim were wheel-shaped angels that never slept and were sometimes said to guard the throne of God. It‚Äôs probably one of the Ophanim.or a UFO falling to the church?What was the Teutonic language?I'd love to see that painting restored. It's gorgeous.Clearly there‚Äôs a lot of problems going on hereEven the UFOs thought the churches sucked.Wild. I wonder if there‚Äôs more art like this out there.I'm pretty sure the Church is shooting the UFO down.Wow!

It depicts God coming down to earth.[deleted]Vikings be like ""they took our jobs!!""And because its a drawing we take it as real evidence?. Not convinced.Not a ufo and not fire. Nice try.Bro thats a mushroom capLooks like an upside-down mushroom to me which would make sense because it's a shroom cultThe 1977 Gallarta Spain OVNI case as it is known is really interesting.  The Spanish Air Force declassified 55 UFO sightings but only four ever received a full investigation ([list here](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=137829)).\s\sGallarta was one of them where a carpenter named Juan Sillero claimed a disc-shaped craft landed near his rural home five times one of which he went on board and spoke with the ""beings.""  Among the things he claims he observed:\s\s&#x200B;\s\s* the disc seemed to be collecting samples of the ground\s* onboard there was a circular console with a red sphere in the middle that ""lit up"" when Spanish Air Force jets approached\s* the beings communicated telepathically with him\s* the beings he observed that didn't communicate to him were grunting to each other and waving their arms exaggeratedly\s* they warned him Earth's axis was ""tilting too much"" something NASA has recently analyzed due to Greenland ice melt and mantle convection (though they aren't worried about it)\s\sIt's a wild story but the Air Force concluded he was a reliable witness and was consistent in his re-tellings.  They ultimately didn't conclude anything landed due to a lack of physical evidence.\s\sYears later an official from that Air Region told journalist JJ Benitez (who covered Juan's case) that there were anomalous radar returns those nights in 1977 and they did scramble jets twice to check it out.  Curiously any mention of radar returns is omitted from the Gallarta case file despite the Spanish military disclosing this information for other sightings.\s\sFull case file (in Spanish): [http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp\_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda\_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886)That time of 1967 to 1977 was the most active period for sightings and abductions in history.\s\sMany experiences like this one are not known by many in modern times but really happened.I mean of all the issues facing Earth today our axis tilting too much is not one of them.\s\sThat said weird pranks and lies from aliens are very common in contactee stories. A friend of mine who was a UFO investigator talked to two men who claimed that the following happened to them:  a flying saucer came down and a regular-looking man came out and asked ""What time is it?""  One of them said ""It's 2:30"" and the alien said ""You are lying. It's 4PM""  and then flew off.\s\s\sMy friend said it was a really stupid story and yet he was convinced these two guys believed that it had happened.  For one thing they were two good ol' boys and they were the laughing stock of the small town they were in.  They seemed desperately embarrassed and knew that it was a stupid story - one of them actually said ""I know this is a stupid story"" - and yet they continued to claim it had happened even though it was clearly working out badly for them.\s\s---\s\sI tend to believe Jacques Vall√©e who ended up believing that UFOs are not from another planet but some sort of local phenomenon connected to geomagnetism.  Note that this does _not_ eliminate the possibility of ""aliens"" - just not ""aliens"" from another world.\s\s""The call is coming from inside the house!""\s\sSee also this excellent book: http://www.tricksterbook.com/\s\s----\s\sThanks for an interesting article!The idea that aliens would want to fuck with us like we do each other is both hilarious and comforting for me.Interesting. Why would they allow him inside freely?

I order from a reputable site ordered twice now and shrooms are great. Comes from BC within 3-5 days.It‚Äôs crazy we have to ALLOW the government to allow us to do what we want with our own life.

They get a kick back while I‚Äôm Dui Inf in the hospital. Win win.So I have to literally be on my death bed for the government to allow me to put what I want in my body?

LOLKeeping drugs illegal keeps a division within society especially when users have to live in fear constantly....any day becoming a life altering series of consequences which killers don't often faceAnd this is how Canada became the place of Psychedelic rocklol if i wanna do shrooms if im dying just go ahead and try to stop me.i did both acid and shrooms and could say the destination is the same on both but acid is the easier trip to take to get there than shrooms. shrooms are way more intense but the after effects are the same on either shrooms or acidCouldn‚Äôt it just be possible you took a higher dose of shrooms than the dose you took for acid?Allowing. Joke. Bad one.I don't know....seems like a waste to me....I think there's a much better demographic.That s cruel cause it only takes one simple thought to make you have a bad trip remember the mind is racing his own race during that timeI don't think that's exactly how it works. Plus I think anyone willing to do psychedelics on their death bed will be pretty well supervised and/or know what they're doingThere's therapy and guidance before during and after the trip to mitigate the possibility of a traumatic experience.There are no bad trips just bad thoughts or memories we dont want to face or deal with.**Strangers**: Read the rules and understand the sub topics listed in the sidebar closely before posting or commenting.

Probably similar to what most people experience in a toxic relationship.I came across this list soon after leaving my ex husband- and I was FLOORED. He did this to me systematically for 15 years. It was wild and I am amazed I was able to break away as easily as I did.\s\sThe thing is I don't believe that he was consciously doing these things- it was like he was born knowing how to manipulate. (Which isn't true because I know he was keen on reading self help and things like ""how to make friends and influence people""- which when used by an apt narcissitic person with a natural skill for reading people is gold for his motives).That‚Äôs how I often describe the relationship between the government & the people. (The govt obviously being the abuser). Many people in the US mimic symptoms of Stockholm syndrome. (Ex: those who are pro-govt pro-police pro-capitalism etc.) They literally end up fighting against their own justice & rights which seems wild but then I remember the brainwashing/abusive dynamic here‚Ä¶This is a short list compared to the long list of tactics they have in place to ensure constant brainwashing/programming.It‚Äôs exactly the same! (Been there done that trying to get out.)Or following certain ""news"" outlets.\s\s(never in my wildest imaginings did I think people would turn to Facebook as a trusted news source. did not have that on my Nostradamus bingo card)I was about to say....Lord you‚Äôre right.Very similar to what‚Äôs going on during the pandemic.That‚Äôs what I was going to say. I feel like I went through these with my ex.Sounds like what children of narcissistic parents experience.Also what people experience when being held after an arrest.I was just about to say...the first thing that comes to my mind is false confessions and how the public can't understand why anyone would confess to something they didn't do and how the confessions trump any other evidence when it comes to trials and stuff. It's just awful.Sounds like the entire restaurant industry.Waiting tables is one of the most fucked up environments I‚Äôve ever worked in.

I know my mother believes it's all some sort of ""mass control."" But I have to ask truly in the spirit of better understanding: to what end? Why would ""the media"" or ""the government"" want to have people wear masks and get vaccinations *aside* from literally just trying to stop the spread of a disease that has already killed millions in just under 2 years? Like what nefarious benefit would someone get by having people wear cough masks?\s\sFor extra bonus points can anyone explain what they believe the claimed ""microchips"" would actually accomplish inside the body? I know the smallest current rfid chip is .125 x .245mm and the largest needle used in COVID vaccine shots has an inner diameter of .337 so you could potentially jam some RFID tags into your arm muscle through the shot... But then what? Rfid tags are inert they bounce back a signal in response to their tiny antennae receiving a radio signal. But they don't do anything by themselves. So you need them to be attached to other chips which are going to increase the size. But then even if you could shrink a chip down small enough to communicate with the outside world and then do something in response to that communication... What could you make it do? It doesn't make sense as a tracking mechanism because just about everyone already has a much more functional and nefarious tracking device in their pocket at nearly all times.\s\sI don't know what I'm missing here in terms of motivations or intended results.I've thought the same thing.  Especially the part about how 6 feet of social distancing is somehow being used as a control.   A coworker went off about it last year claiming it was so ""THEY could track us better through our cell phones because it was harder to count them in crowds"".  Even if that was true to what end?  What's the point?\s\sA lot of nuts have plenty of reasons they think masks are a conspiracy too. Some BS about covering faces is against their religion (death cult/magaconservative Christianity) ""covering up God's image"" or some kind of Sharia law thing.  Another is that it somehow is being used to damage children's psyches or it's a test run for another version of psychological warfare.\s\sOne of my wife's coworkers is convinced the vaccine is some sort of population control by sterilization.  She still got at least one shot since a planned trip required her to get vaccinated in order to go anywhere in NYC.I was thinking more with the whole racism in America thing. Yeah it exists here like anywhere. Is it as bad as people say? Probably not. But it is highlighted in media to be a huge problem. I can think of a video about ‚Äúracism in America‚Äù for almost every one of those numbers. This isn‚Äôt to say that historically racism has led to the system we have today. But does the average person hate someone because their not the same color? No. They‚Äôre probably more likely to hate someone for being a ‚Äúleftist‚Äù or ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù.The mask and covid restrictions are supposed to be a way of conditioning people so in the future they will comply with whatever the plan is.   The chip thing is about tracking you and implementing a digital currency. 5g conspiracies claim the chip will allow the government to be able to control your mind or even kill you if you have a chip.   All of it sounds crazy but a lot of things have sounded crazy before it was realityReminds me of how the media wants us to feel because of this new diseaseHm. Covid maybe?How so?Like people who where 3+ masks whilst they drive aloneOr people who invent stories about fictional people to make themselves feel better about themselves.No one does this. Maybe like 1 in 100000 or less.

This is in large part because the ownership class works very hard day and night to make manipulation via torture and abuse seem like regular day-to-day practice. \s\sI'm sorry you had to endure that and I'm glad you got out.Mental illness absolutely can be induced by one person onto another.

Gaslighting goal post moving emotional blackmail  physical violence as punishment  isolation  and even torture at times.  Dont ever feel bad or stupid bc they pick you for a reason.  They try to steal our authenticity and goodness bc they are empty inside and need us to sustain themselves. That's why they keep coming back. We are like drugs to them. Think of them like emotional vampires. It's great you got out and didn't waste a lot of time. You will heal and be better off for it.

Especially if you were a Marine.‚ÄúWhite Fragility‚Äù ringin a really strong bell hereI‚Äôll bet this list of emotional states is applied unironically to groups of people who disagree with insane conspiracies. Qanon has been accusing ‚Äúnormies‚Äù of being in a brainwashed cultic state for a couple years now.\s\sThe list tracks pretty well with what we know about brainwashing propaganda gaslight and manipulation. We see Item 9 play out quite a lot in social media these days in that radicalized dummies seem to always exhibit a persecution complex.In a way we're all being brain washed. But it's called conditioning. We're being conditioned to accept ever more indecent absurd and just wrong behaviour and attitudes. We are being divided and isolated. We're encouraged to be narcissistic sadistic & medicated.\sThe fact that the ""intelligence"" community are manipulating on a mass scale is not surprising.\sWhat's surprising is how so few of us realise this and even fewer are afraid to look above the parapet and ask why the status quo is so.\sI'm off to put my tin foil hat back on and hide from the MIB whilst I pop Xanax like tic tac and pray for Osiris/Siva to come back and save us.you're not wrongThis sounds like how social media works...*bingo*This is exactly the kind of thing that took place when the US school system took a hard turn to authoritarianism in the early 1990s.  Zero tolerance and demoralization narratives instilled dependence on authority and ideological indoctrination.  This is why so many later millennials and early Z's are completely lacking in self discipline critical thinking and everything else that makes one a competent human being.This started in the 80's with the Reagan era ""Just say no"" indoctrination. Schools in the 70's would have ""sit-ins"" by the students to get more freedoms and Rec Centers put in place for kids to belong to. Drugs were discussed in a civilized manner with kids and real counseling was available. Then the ""Drugs are bad m'kay?"" started and corporate rule was put into place because parents couldn't parent anymore.Gen Xer checking in...\s\sThis whole demonization of Millennials is reminiscent of how ‚Äúthey‚Äù treated Gen X.  I guess all generations get the treatment but the fact is that these groups have grown up in a society that is crumbling before their eyes yet they are held to some standard of performance that just isn‚Äôt widely available to them.  They‚Äôre just fine considering what they contend with economically culturally and politically.  Their generation has mostly lived during a time of war as military members have endured more combat than most WWII veterans and have been subject to more propaganda and psyops than any pre 9/11 generation.  They don‚Äôt lack self discipline critical thinking or anything else than makes one a competent human being.  That‚Äôs a lazy argument.I was born in 1982 but never felt a part of my generation  and was told since early childhood I'm an ""old soul"". Now fast forward to today I dont have anything in common with my generation.  I feel like they speak a different language and honestly they disturb me. In general  they cannot think for themselves at all and social acceptance is everything.  They are mostly unsuccessful and miserable too. That's just my opinion from people I know around my age. Its very strange.CIA created the term ""brainwashing"" in order to discredit captured agents.If you want to create a Unibomber this is how you do it.Me: *checks on mood* nope still don't give a fuck what popular opinion is. Still all good herePopular opinion? I feel like you‚Äôve seriously misunderstood the concept here.\s\sBrainwashing has nothing to do with popular opinion. I don‚Äôt think Charles Manson‚Äôs or Jim Jones‚Äô opinions were mainstream or popular but they successfully brainwashed people. \s\sIt‚Äôs actually concerning that you immediately thought ‚Äúpopular opinion‚Äù and implied that since your opinions are less mainstream that you couldn‚Äôt have possibly been brainwashed ever and are somehow immune. \s\sThat‚Äôs scary. What made you say this? Can you explain your logic behind this conclusion?That's actually a very popular opinion you have there. Maybe that's when they got you!Why do i feel like this was what i experienced during this pandemic living with anti capitalists and atheist?Join us comrade[removed][removed]Good social credit botEven if this sub is a right wing echo chamber like 90% of reddit is a left wing one. Upvotes are useless if you are over the age of 16 and care so much about them you've got big problems in your life lol.Source?Cia.goveither page is getting he reddit hug of death or......wont even finish loadingWhile in the context of brainwashing this seems bad doesn‚Äôt this just describe the process of getting over trauma? When taking out step 4 it really just seems like something a person goes through when learning something that staggers their perspective reality. Or am I missing something? Genuinely curious.This is a great podcast about the entire situation. \s\s[https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/440-brainwashed](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/440-brainwashed)\s\sThe guilty parties have never been brought to justice.Source?Sounds like the covidiotsQanon checklistGood to know.\s\s""Oh my you startled me!

This is something worth remembering.\s\sThis part of the documents talks about the different emotional states created during the brainwashing process. It looks like it depends on cracking the person and then taking advantage of the trauma in order to create a new sense of ""belonging"" or identity...So how small cults work? They break a person down and build them up to be someone else. And before you know it you have a dozen people working themselves to death on your commune in Canada while you cut their fingers and toes off for fun. And they stick around like that for a decade.*googles MK ULTRA*\s\sJesus fuck.Is the whole document available to the public? If so I‚Äôd love to know where you found it!Ahhhhhhhh very cunty of themWhat document is this from?Can you link to the document itself? Would really appreciate it.Sounds like army basic trainingIt is. Some have said the army is a cult.Thats the point and also why so many vets can't reintegrate back into society (aside from the PTSD many have which complicates things).I'm fully convinced that social medias are undertaking actions to influence the opinion of the society at large induce certain emotional states and more. Some among these feature almost text-book examples of brainwashing techniques similar to the ones in OP as performed by ""fellow users"".\s\sThat's why it's vital to never stay in one place for too long never go to deep never to bind with local society too much. ;)Reddit is a prime example of effective brainwashing.Actually binding yourself to your localized communities is the antidote. Mass media including social media is the poison of spectacle.\s\sMass media will be the only society you can relate to if you're always running from your local communities.100% of the media is propagandaThe news networks are even worse. They should be called anti-social media.FB admitted manipulating streams to affect moodI do wonder what they were thinking of when they wrote ""Initial feeling of surprise"" like dude you just gave him enough LSD to kill a walrus what did you think would happenMaybe the researchers would go in an do a little magic trick.Now this is the r/HighStrangeness shit I love. I don't think anybody could actually know the full extent to which the CIA influences seemingly mundane aspects of our lives. But I *really* don't think anybody could say that they don't manipulate our lives atleast somehow.I‚Äôve been seeing post about someone having asthma problems because the amount of cremations in California I see these kind of post every day that just screams propaganda. Kind of like how you‚Äôve been seeing so many post celebrating people turning in their family to the FBI""There are 4 lights.""This reminds me of my past relationship which I have been free from for years. Isn't being single great?My tired ass thought this was an r/antiwork meme.üíÄ2 + 2 = 5.I will never forgive the American Psychological Association for condoning the psychologists that participated in torture research.\s\sOh and *fuck* those psychologists particularly.\s\sSource: am psychologistAnd water boarding.Are these the files of the black vault?Anyone have the link to this doc?Someone shared their podcast discussing this a few months back.

I think that the powers that be understands how mental illness such as Disassociative Identity Disorder works much more than they let on because they want to use it against us or their ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. I feel like the value system of treat yourself and others how you wish to be treated is pretty foolproof though as long as you keep it simpleSounds kind of like a certain global FUD campaign we've been living under for a year or so.Here here !\sGood find \sExactly what‚Äôs happeningAn interesting similarity with how Barry Long describes the ""thinker""'s reaction to not thinking in the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrxRgpsrpGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrxRgpsrpGg)Sauce?[removed]Your account must be a minimum of 2 weeks old to post comments or posts.\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

That‚Äôs it. It actually kind of disturbed me while I was watching it. It‚Äôs not like this was the first time I thought of this but they put some crazy shit in these supposed ‚Äúkids‚Äù shows that is revealing and also scary how this plays right into brainwashingOperation MockingbirdSo y'all just link to the CIA website around here? Cool and totally normal.Funny it‚Äôs also the same emotional states caused by being a member of society in America.\s\sOmg wait are we all...?This is so creepy. Many of the various social and political movements that have sprung up in the past few decades rely on these emotional states. It's always existed in societies although I'm convinced it's become exponentially worse recently. They maintain tight control over nearly organization and movement.\s\sI'm certain that the federal government is running all kinds of psy-ops on the general populace. They're using these techniques to divide and conquer the public in order to maintain control. They've infiltrated all levels of entertainment and media. Marketing is essentially based on manipulating people's brains to invoke control. It's borderline witchcraft.\s\sIt's shocking to me to see how many people are okay with submitting control to these fucks. They want to control every aspect of our lives. They want us to become walking talking puppets of the DNC and the GOP whichever flavor of authoritarianism that people find palpable. The government is not the friend of the American people.You nailed itDo you really think they did all this research that we now know about and aren't using it? Even if not the government corporations hire former intelligence officers and weasel out their secrets to make us buy more shit we don't need.Yeah I was gonna say-pretty much described my life.Welcome to the education system.Mass brainwashing has been fine tuned for a very long time yet there are people out there that think it isn't real or a conspiracy theory...it's sad as they too are brainwashed to some degree without even knowing it.Facebook has become a very effective tool for this. Or social media in general.I was just thinking about this yesterday. The MKULTRA experiments may have ended (just one example I‚Äôm sure) but only after an enormous amount of knowledge and data had been collected. There is a ton of applicable knowledge on changing people‚Äôs minds. \s\sIt‚Äôs like a ‚Äúmoving from trials to production‚Äù phase.Just because we're aware of it doesn't mean we're completely immune either.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/03/montreal-brainwashing-allan-memorial-institute](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/03/montreal-brainwashing-allan-memorial-institute)   \s[https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/m\_episodes/2017-2018/brainwashed-the-secret-cia-experiments-in-canada](https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/m_episodes/2017-2018/brainwashed-the-secret-cia-experiments-in-canada)\s\s[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-government-gag-order-mk-ultra-1.4448933](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-government-gag-order-mk-ultra-1.4448933)\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThe pM of canada himself put a gag order on the casehave you ever heard the conspiracy theories of someone that is really deep in the brainwashing?  one of which i heard the other day ""there's a theory that aliens haven't made direct contact because their societies keep crumbling like rome did"" i was like....\shold up... a whole bunch of alien contact was just declassified and this is your theory?  lmaoReminds me of schoolOr some religious cult or trying to leave itYepBingo!My USMC boot camp experience all wrapped up.Correct break you down and build you back up.This is my rifle this is my gun!Makes you wonder if they perfected it by now. They probably did and many people in high positions are actually brainwashed and controlled to spread certain messages and so on. How long until we live in a world similar to 1984 :)... depressing..You're already in it man. Almost everything is nonsensicalIt‚Äôs here.So that‚Äôs why drill Sargents are the way they are.Think I'm being brainwashed then that's me.1984Would the impersonal machinery of control be equivalent to the interrogator‚Äôs authority?This is literally what Ego-Death is.I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like a trip where you almost have an ego death. A true ego death makes you forget that you (your physical form) even exist(s). There‚Äôs no You to defend.Now ask yourself just how many political ideological groups rely on exactly these steps. \s\s1. ""You have no power as an individual."" \s2. ""Just look what horrible things have been going on that you weren't even aware were bad."" \s3.

Except (4) since there needs to be an interrogator these feelings are kind of similar to when you face your ego. Being uncertain feeling guilt doubting yourself and wanting to find an easy way out. Then you look inward and develop your own value system.Well if we‚Äôre considering that this method (in its presumably simplest form) can be/is being used on a mass scale then each idea listed evolves to fit that scale. Also considering they would most likely use clusters of demographics to achieve this the idea of an ‚Äúinterrogator‚Äù could look like anything from the President of the United States to Tony the Tiger.The Numbers Mason....Ya'll need to listen to Poisoner in Chief about the beginning of CIA focusing on Sidney Gottlieb and his crazy obsession with mind control. It's so much more spectacular and disturbing than I imagined!Operation Mockingbird has achieved a loss of objectivity in almost everyone.I blame that on social media and the human condition of people needing continuous affirmation and praise.This fits the covid fear mongering and subsequent population control perfectlywhere is 1.?This is happening to all of us through social media and the general media. Some people are more susceptible but no one is immune. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of tv shows have been pushing similar themes and it feels like entertainment has become a propaganda machine. How much attention you receive on these platforms is controlled by algorithms designed by people who at best want to make money and at worse have shady tides to Russia and the US government. I think Russia and the US government have been conducting social engineering war fare through the American public I think this is why everyone has been losing their minds and becoming increasingly radicalized in the US. If you start to stray from whatever they want you to think all it takes is a pop socket account comment a targeted ad recommending you a video or post to help put you where they want you to be. When George Floyd died I found it strange that the news kept playing videos of him getting choked to death on a loop for instance. This was odd to me because the news has a tendency to censor disturbing content as well as at least giving a disclaimer that the content may be disturbing to some viewers but they just straight up played video of a man getting choked to death over and over and over again with little to no warning. I think they were trying to rile people up who knows to what end exactly but something is very wrong with the American media right now and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly blatant.What themes have you noticed entertainment pushing?Is this like GaslightingWhat part of the document is it from? It‚Äôs 92 pages longThis explains antifaSounds like Landmark Forum.Sounds like high schoolLmaoWilliam Blum writes extensively about CIA mental manipulation/torture in ‚ÄúKilling Hope‚Äù.

It has significantly strengthened who I am within and helped me over come my many self-doubts depression and feeling lost in life and in spirit. Though much of that can be attributed to being surrounded with the right influences of consciously positive uplifting constructive energies.[deleted]Sounds like my workplace..Came here to say this.I must be getting brainwashedLmao. The government brainwashes people all the time. Just look at mainstream society. It's all the governments work in the end and then the people brainwash each other and keep them trapped in a loop extremely difficult to escape as BS materialist thoughts have been ingrained in them deeply from the womb. Any alternative ideas are only discussed in niche places such as this otherwise paid workers and brainwashed people alike will call us crazy. And even then some get through. The war on consciousness has gone on for far too long and needs to end ASAP. We all need to wake up before it's too late.Yuuuup. I have a group of friends (more like acquaintances) who all work in sales and are extremely materialistic. Everything is about who is leasing the hottest car who has the most designer clothes and jewelry who's sleeping with the hottest girl. Meanwhile these are MEN in their mid to late 30's with families. With wives and little children. Some of them bring their young kids around dangerous places and just let them roam while they drink and party. Yet bring up any of this to them and you're the crazy one.I like the way you think. I slave away in an office to make a rich man richer for pennies on the dollar as my salary. Then I buy shit to fill an emotional void that was created by the soul sucking job in the first place.Might I introduce you to a fine ideology that fits your worldview... comrade?

Someone remembers a large owl then after regression therapy the layer of false memory is stripped away revealing something different. False memory is a form of mind control.

It‚Äôs a seven-pointed lattice one moment and a ten-pointed lattice the next or whatever.\s\s>What‚Äôs amazing about time crystals is that when they cycle back and forth between two different configurations they don‚Äôt lose or use any energy.\s\s>Time crystals can survive energy processes without falling victim to entropy. The reason they‚Äôre called time crystals is because they can have their cake and eat it too.\s\s>They can be in a state of having eaten the whole cake and then cycle right back to a state of still having the cake ‚Äì and they can theoretically do this forever and ever.\s\s>Most importantly they can do this inside of an isolated system. That means they can consume the cake and then magically make it reappear over and over again forever without using any fuel or energy.Ok cool but where did they come from? Did google create them? Did someone just find them somewhere?What I'm getting from this is we are 1 quadrillionth of a percent closer to answering The Last Question...\s\s ""How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be\smassively decreased?""Google can barely make their ad-serving work.

General Relativity in particular uses a 4-dimensional spacetime (3 spacial dimensions one temporal dimension) manifold to describe interactions pertaining to gravity energy and light in particular.If my understanding is correct the 4th dimension looks like thought dreams or simply imagination. While Humans are not the best at occupying this dimension we haven't skipped it. There are ppl that can astral project/ lucid dream some drugs can take you there for what feels like forever.4th dimension is time num-nutsI heard Jeffery Epstein talk about something like this years ago.

Billions and billions on labs and funds and dark matter was never found and probably never will be. Electricity is the key plasma and dust are holding it together not some invisible non-interacting particle> Billions and billions on labs and funds and dark matter was never found and probably never will be\s\sMaybe it's something that can't be found in the way we're looking for it. Like imagine climbing every tree in search of oysters and pearls and then concluding when your search inevitably ends up fruitless that oysters and pearls simply cannot be real because you've checked every tree.Dark Matter does exist we know that. We have had [direct proof](https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06297_CHANDRA_Dark_Matter.html) of it for over a decade it's all around us and the universe has plenty of it.\s\sWe just don't know why it's there or what it does. It has an effect on gravity giving us something called ""gravitational lensing"". We also see strange effects in rotating galaxies galaxies that combine and hot gas.\s\sIt's probably one of the strangest things about the universe that we can actually prove exists.If the math checks out its far more possible than ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù. Sounds like a pessimistic view.Sounds like you should need to be writing a paperPretty much.\s\sJust the name dark matter shows the current problem in thinking.\s\sTo start with it should probably be more accurately called dark ""mass"" but our physics has no distinction between matter and mass.I volunteer as tributeMore scientists sitting in rooms reading too much sci fi too high on their own farts just making crap up to explain the holes in their current theories.The age of aquariussssss ‚ôí üíìAaaaaaaQuariusssssss...ExcusemesaywhatCome to me my childrenwho said thatFeed us from your hefty breastiesMaybe we should master this one....\s before we start fkn up another.More math bullshit mathematical dimensions arnt the same thing as say living in the 3rd spacial dimension. They are purely mathematical gymnastics. They have no proof any of it exists yet they act as if its not all theoretical.How on earth can you say 'more math bullshit' when it has been proven again and again to be the best tool we have to describe the world and universe around us.Math = EverythingWhy downvote he‚Äôs rightI thought String theory proposed multiple universes already and I at least thought that this meant that these subatomic particles exist in other reality as well and we are witnessing their observation and by that their existence. Not too out there to say that Dark Matter exist in another dimension that interact with our own in a way that we can detect it but we can‚Äôt mess with it.There is that saying of ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt explain it simply you don‚Äôt understand it‚Äù and I think of that every time I see what is happening in theoretical physics. The great draw of Einstein and the quantum theorists is they were able to explain the ideas in simple widely applicable ideasThere's a whole bunch of things we can't explain. I have an idea let's create a new particle that lets us warp into this imagination land that explains everything we can't already explain.DON'T LET THEM IN !!!Ah yes the warp. Of course!Where do I sign up? This dimension and a great deal of the people in it are trash.To get there mentally requires a perspective change. Are some people trash or did they experience a lot of pain in their life that they need help digging out of?Event Horizon noooope!Don‚Äôt!!! Or we end up like Event Horizon or Warhammer 40k for that matter ...Or the mistand OMG this is all based on....wait for it....absolutely nothing but speculation.TLDR at bottom. \s\s\sHere‚Äôs a little philosophy of science for those that are downvoting everyone for being skeptical about this. \s\s\sThe downfall for mathematical models is quite ironic- that they are so capable of describing just about any interaction and behavior that there are infinite ways of describing the same function. \s\s\sThink of a entering a function for some shape on a calculator. Well it turns out there is an infinite number of different functions that would graph the same shape. In physics terminology - there are an infinite number of mathematical models with equal descriptive and predictive power with respect to the actual universe. \s\s\sSecondly is the problems pointed out in the Duhem-Quine thesis which states that for any system S any hypothesis H can be maintained if modifications are made to background assumptions of system S. \s\s\sIn physics terms: in the system of fundamental physics the core hypothesis of dark matter can be maintained regardless of any opposing evidence by modifying auxiliary hypothesis (in this case modifying some aspect of physical dimensions). You can do this forever without coming closer to truth \s\s\s\sLastly add to this Kuhn‚Äôs observation that science tends to advance not linearly but in intervals of stagnation where people refuse to alter their core hypothesis and periods of scientific revolution where the core paradigms are altogether shattered and replaced. This tells us we should expect a sort of scientific closed mindedness and these mathematical models are very much an invention to try to protect their core paradigm (using Duhem-Quine)- like Copernicus introducing epicycles to correct deviations between observed and predicted orbits. \s\s\sTLDR; These models are just conjecture perhaps even a form of scientific close mindedness. However the conjecture and generation of hypothesis is how science advances. So it is ‚Äújust some math bullshit‚Äù but bullshit is also how just about every discovery begins.Well it's a Vice article after all.Mmm actually it‚Äôs based on [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-08851-0).\s\sI may not be able to understand it but then again I‚Äôm not a theoretical physicist.And so was the Higgs boson particle until they discovered it. That‚Äôs how science worksso did you read the scientific research paper attached...or ?? i‚Äôm guessing you didn‚ÄôtYou didn‚Äôt read or understand shit lol....you do understand that science isn‚Äôt ever fact right.. that‚Äôs why they are theories..I‚Äôve seen event horizon.So many interesting theories. Yet they mean absolutely nothing for everyday life. I wish scientists would actually discover something groundbreaking & awesome.Wild . But they cant figure out where coronavirus came from .Nah... they know where it came from... they just don't want to admit it because they wouldn't get any future funding for viral research and gain of function experiments would be banned.

You can't prove anything.\s\sBut lets just say after all I've heard and experienced myself it wouldn't surprise me. At all. I don't expect it but I wouldn't question it.I find it really interesting that in one of the books by Jane Roberts her friend Sue Watkins had a telepathic dream where she communicated with a different dominant species of high intelligence that appeared to be cat looking people that iirc were from a different probability. They shared some level of information with her that drifted from her conscious mind as she woke up. This happened back in the 70's.\-\_- so late Egypt people know it a long time ago that's why they worship cat.

The only time in my life I had lucid dreams was when I took Chantax the anti smoking drug. In one dream I was exploring a shipwreck and I kept finding a bunch of gold coins.

LolAnd then they are gonna have ads no thank you I rather lucid dreaming no machines needed we already can do so powerade by our own brains.Ive been wondering my whole life if the day would ever arrive where a drug or tool would exist that allows us to control/manipulate or explore our dreams in a conscious or lucid state on command.  \sMaybe the day is near :)Sounds like they‚Äôre building an external manual control to let you become lucid while in a dreamWhether the information was bollocks or not isnt my point here but doesn't the CIA declassified info on astral projection state they found a way to project near instantly? Maybe this is similar technology.Isn‚Äôt that just lucid dreaming?Really?You don't need a machine to do this you can just train/teach yourself to lucid dream and/or astral project.

I've been fascinated with the idea for years and have honestly just come to my own conclusion that it's true.\s\sI'm gonna stay away from the comments there though.\s\s>This mudflood type theory only puts our current civilization at about 250 to 300 years old I think. To clarify some of these theories state we had a cataclysm (I think approx 10000 years ago or maybe earlier) that almost wiped us all out but some survived underground etc. Those who survived didn't fully resurface and start to fully repopulate parts of earth until 1750.\s\sWe're only 300 years old? Like what?Mudflood is the deep strangeness. Jesuit/Catholic rewriting of history the annihilation of the ""Tartarian"" empire and its legacy. Greco-roman/colonial architecture all being in situ around the world and then re-inhabited by the conquerors. The US civil war being a mask for the final stand of the Tartarians...It's heady stuff and way way out there.\s\sI've put my head in the overall theory before and can't buy it (obviously) but it is a fascinating rabbit hole. You can check out r/culturallayer r/tartaria r/mudflood and especially stolenhistory.org if you want to go there.\s\sThere's definitely something odd about old buildings being built with windows and a door on the basement level (underground) and it's basically impossible for a building in a city/town with regular foot traffic and occupation to somehow accumulate enough ""cultural layer"" (this being dirt/trash that accretes over decades and centuries) that they suddenly have to build a new entrance on the 2nd floor...No one swept the porch for 100 years so then they had to built a new door 1 level up? Can't get my head around that.A very very interesting read.Earth Starts with Sumerians and beyond that is all high strangeness.High Strangeness is reality.#OOPARTSI‚Äôm sorry but as a conspiracy theorist if there was a more advanced civilization we would find traces in currency. I need to see currency that‚Äôs been produced to modern standards before I believe there was one that was more advanced that our own. Imperfect circle coins vs what an American quarter would a great start.While I'm not saying I believe in something like an ancient advanced civilisation I think that it would be very possible for a civilisation to develop without currency no? It's not like money is an universal concept.What if they didn't value currency like we do? It can be a means to purchase and trade and not be idolized the way our current society does. If that were the case why would they care to make extravagant coins that were perfectly uniform? Make sure it's the right weight slap it with a stamp and it's ready for use. \s\sWe can't instill our culture on the past when trying to think of how or why things happened.The very first case is of a copper quasi coin being found which was estimated to be at least 200k years old. \s\sAm I missing something?What if they had digital currency like we have? They could‚Äôve advanced past our idea of credit cards and used something non-physicalThe earliest known currency was cowrie shells. Other civilisations used a system of ropes with elaborate knottings to track family ledgers / debts within their community. How do you know you would recognise this ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô for what it is? Also hunter gatherers survived for thousands of years with no currency trading objects or skills with other bands of travellers.currency? i wouldn't consider a civilization even close to being advanced if they still rely on physical currency they have to carry around on their persons.  I think currency would be one of the last things we find. \s\sRegardless the evidence is undoubtedly down there. its just too deep under dirt too see itThere‚Äôs an incredible amount of evidence of ancient advanced civilizations the megalithic structures are there for you to learn about.Very interesting list thanks for the link! There were many I hadn't heard of yet here.\s\sI'm glad it didn't include the London Hammer which is always brought up as *the* OOPART. But it's clear that it's modern even before you start to look at the object itself. Just looking at the creationist museum it's in and how they make grand claims and publish ""facts"" about the alloy and the rock it was found in yet not a single place they show you who made the analysis or even when it was made. It's just speculation on their part.What a fantastic read from r/conspiracy. Wonder how many posts like this get buried under all the politics over there.There‚Äôs another conspiracy sub that deletes all political conspiracies/or political talk.There are still gems scattered throughout the feed for people who search by new.Its kinda like a dumpster fire  but if  that dumpster was outside of a voting booth and said trash were absentee ballotsGod I miss when there were actual conspiracies there and not just people ranting about Bill Gates and 5G towers.

And i came too and hes standing there ready to dial 911. I didnt know what happened i thought i just fell asleep because i was yawning.

Go get some fresh air"" so i went to open the outside door. Then i blacked out. Came too laying on the door frame half in half out  bro was losing it again it was freaking me out. I got up saw headlights thought they were the pizza dudes. I asked him where the money was for pizza. But he didnt order pizza he couldnt stop laughing while ordering lol. And after i came to and was settled into the couch i just felt like we were the only people and there was nothing outside the door like. Blackness. Was kinda nightmarish.\s\s\sThen i after a few years i took it with my wife. And was a really great experience. I was really hesitant to do it after that though. But when i did. It was great i got experience the non stop laughing. We were watching miss peregrines home for peculiar children. What made us laugh was i was paying for the pizza and apparently the pizza dude was peaking at my wife through the slit between door and the frame by the hinges. Was making her laugh. I seen him like crane his neck to the left a bit. Was hilarious. \s\sSorry for the long ass story but thought id share my first bad experience then giving it a second try.My trip on mushrooms resulted in a seizure. it was a small one and I never did anything about it but I think back to that day and wonder what caused it. I‚Äôm not going to try again to find out though lol.Did you try using it again after this experience?Always have a sitter for all those wonderingA good point. I should note I am not advocating nor advising anyone use Psilocybin by posting this research. My intent is to raise awareness to the potentially profound benefits of this substance for those in need and one of the more recently discovered mechanisms by which it tends to exert its potential benefits. I wouldn't expect most people to drop everything (pun intended) and seek this substance after reading this article nor that they would have the ability or access to do so. To me it's more of an interesting anecdote to add to the now voluminous amount of research illustrating the potential and often likely benefits this substance can provide some people. Of course as with anything of this nature your results will likely vary and of course will not be for everyone perhaps even most people. And if you do decide to take that step ensure you do so cautiously legally in a safe environment and starting with a lower dosage to gauge your reaction and to avoid doing so entirely if you suffer from any medical or mental condition that may make you more prone to experience any adverse reaction.hiw many tumes do i have to read this exact post with this exact headline and exact link. we know. we get it. mushrooms are good.I'm sorry to hear you've been apparently inundated with this story. Had I known it was this ubiquitous I probably wouldn't have posted it. Honestly I rarely browse r/all much at this point opting instead to focus on the communities I moderate and contribute to foremost as well as a handful of others of particular interest. I'll keep your feedback in mind and check other subreddits covering similar subjects for similar stories more frequently moving forward.Source paper:\s\s[A single psilocybin dose is associated with long-term increased mindfulness preceded by a proportional change in neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X20300602?via%3Dihub)\s\sAbstract:\s\s> A single dose of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist psilocybin can have long-lasting beneficial effects on mood personality and potentially on mindfulness but underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we for the first time conduct a study that assesses psilocybin effects on cerebral 5-HT2AR binding with [11C]Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and on personality and mindfulness. Ten healthy and psychedelic-na√Øve volunteers underwent PET neuroimaging of 5-HT2AR at baseline (BL) and one week (1W) after a single oral dose of psilocybin (0.2‚Äì0.3 mg/kg). Personality (NEO PI-R) and mindfulness (MAAS) questionnaires were completed at BL and at three-months follow-up (3M). Paired t-tests revealed statistically significant increases in personality Openness (puncorrected = 0.04 mean change [95%CI]: 4.2[0.4;‚àû]) which was hypothesized a priori to increase and mindfulness (pFWER = 0.02 mean change [95%CI]: 0.5 [0.2;0.7]). Although 5-HT2AR binding at 1W versus BL was similar across individuals (puncorrected = 0.8 mean change [95%CI]: 0.007 [‚àí0.04;0.06]) a post hoc linear regression analysis showed that change in mindfulness and 5-HT2AR correlated negatively (Œ≤ [95%CI] = ‚àí5.0 [‚àí9.0; ‚àí0.9] pFWER= 0.046). In conclusion we confirm that psilocybin intake is associated with long-term increases in Openness and ‚Äì as a novel finding ‚Äì mindfulness which may be a key element of psilocybin therapy. Cerebral 5-HT2AR binding did not change across individuals but the negative association between changes in 5-HT2AR binding and mindfulness suggests that individual change in 5-HT2AR levels after psilocybin is variable and represents a potential mechanism influencing long-term effects of psilocybin on mindfulness.I'll put this as a reply to OP. Here is a link to the full study https://docdro.id/NDZWi0q I'm not sure how long it will be available.  \s\sTwo things to note this is not yet peer reviewed and the study only had 10 subjects. Could be interesting though.Can confirm.  Went to the 12 dimensions met with 15 ft praying mantis who are the guardians.  And it got rid of my depression. *THUMBS UP*.  Seriously though use with caution.  Set and setting are very important.  Look into terrance mckenna alan watts.\s\s*edit for my A.D.D. mispellingInteresting you would word them ""preying"" and not the correct ""praying"" mantis. Be careful.In this day an age people aren‚Äôt guided correctly in their trips. They can reach that stage of mindfulness but many freak out. It turns into a ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù and they end up blocking the whole experience from their minds in a PTSD kind of way.wtf is mindfulnessmind¬∑ful¬∑ness\s\s1. The quality or state of being conscious or aware of something.\s\s2. A mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings thoughts and bodily sensations used as a therapeutic technique.As I said prior it's an established form of meditation that originated in Eastern region that is now used by Western medicine to treat anxiety and depression among other disorders and in some schools to notably increase student performance and concentration. The fact that psilocybin has been found to increase one's ability to perform this task by default without prior instruction through neurological changes to the brain may also contribute at least in part to its now extensively researched therapeutic effects.\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindfulnessSo where can I get some?All I know is that pre-mushroom Tools Lateralus was ho hum post mushroom fucking fantastic.I love you stranger.  Spiral out keep goingLiterally went on a 30 minute Tool binge before I remembered what I was doing in the first place thank you üñ§As with any psychedelic having a ""guide"" is very important to the individual on the ""trip"". Not only can a guide talk you thru tough/scary situations that may arise but also ensure the safety and well-being of that person while on their ""trip"". Not everyone is wired to handle such psychedelics and it is crucial that the patient undergo a thorough mental and physical evaluation prior to micro/dosing. The breakthroughs with psylicibin on Alzheimer's patients and people with PTSD is absolutely AMAZING! The stigma attached to psychedelics and even marijuana are slowly being replaced with scientific research and information not available 10-15 years ago. I hope someday soon this type of therapy will be available to those who would truly benefit from it.[deleted]macro dosing >>> micro dosing \s\syou should at least have one proper trip before you start a microdosing regimen in my opinion. microdosing is a mood boost and definitely helps with anxiety depression etc but it doesn't solve your problems. tripping can show you your thought patterns or repressed emotions that cause your mental problems to begin with and then you can work on undoing them and learning healthier ways of thinking with the help of microdosing.I really really REALLY want to try micro dosing.Microdosing is super fun but man is taking a lot of mushrooms terrifying.\s\sSource: ate an eighth tonight and met the devilLol it just triggered a manic episode for me.

Ron Hubbard of later Scientology fame (and infamy). \s\s> Sex Magick\s> \s> The degrees of the Hermit Triad are of a sexual nature. In the VIII¬∞ degree the initiate is taught masturbation magical practices in the IX¬∞ degree magical techniques related to vaginal intercourse and in the XI¬∞ a form of sex magick involving anal intercourse.\s> \s> The basis of OTO's sex magic is Crowley's theory of mixing of semen and female ejaculate released during the sex magic operation to produce an ""elixir"" which is then ingested or smeared on an object for magical purposes.\s\s--\s\s> The Babalon Working was a series of magic ceremonies or rituals performed from January to March 1946 by author pioneer rocket-fuel scientist and occultist Jack Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. This ritual was essentially designed to manifest an individual incarnation of the archetypal divine feminine called Babalon. The project was based on the ideas of Aleister Crowley and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel Moonchild.\s\sNot to mention what priests have been accused of as of late.

In many cases there have been accounts of UFOs entering or coming out of water. Its a fairly fascinating phenomenon. How they were able to launch out of water from what I understand the craft use propulsion technology that manipulates the gravitational field around the craft.The article is so dumb though.

Under some conditions it's possible that some may exist for tens of millions of years.Like 1000 + years in landfills. It‚Äôs crazy to think that whole civilizations could have existed and be swept completely away. But the earth is old and all the junk we create is actually pretty fragile. Even things like steel structures and giant wire/cables plastics and concrete objects. They all break down relatively fast when compared to a planetary timescale.Would depend on the plastic etchttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_CthulhuOne really interesting thing to consider is civilizations created by non-human animals or even human ancestor species. Trey the explainer did a really good video on it.Look underwaterUghhhh the picture from the ""Planet of the Apes"" is more accurate to this post that you can imagine ...\s\s(Change the present and future to past and present and America to Atlantis)Highly recommend you read the [actual paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/77818514AA6907750B8F4339F7C70EC6/S1473550418000095a.pdf/silurian_hypothesis_would_it_be_possible_to_detect_an_industrial_civilization_in_the_geological_record.pdf) over any summary of it it's not extremely technical and makes for a fascinating read.

When you put it into the perspective that studying this concept will aid us in studying other planets like Mars in the future to see if they could have had an advanced alien civilization millions of years ago it seems like such important research.It should be pretty obvious by now. I mean they've found evidence of water having existed on Mars right? And bacteria from meteorites from Mars so you would think *some* kind of life was there millions of years ago even if just microbial.[deleted]Nice.Best place to look is for trash on the Moon. What‚Äôs left there won‚Äôt change for millions of years.Bright Insight channel on YoutubeI like that guy!ThxInteresting read1000 years is about 1.6ft of dirt accumulated roughly. 10000 years is 16ft or the Clovis culture in North America. Yes that means you have to dig 16ft to find their axes pottery arrow heads that‚Äôs why archeologists are always digging. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúUpper paleolithic‚Äù vs ‚ÄúLower Paleolithic‚Äù lower being older. \s\sA million years is 1600ft. That‚Äôs about a third of a mile or 5 football fields in length. The average depth of oil is about 3600 feet or about twice that much.\s\sDigs are extremely technical and need to be handled delicately and we barely find anything. It‚Äôs hard enough to dig anywhere on this planet but to dig 1600ft delicately seems near impossible. I‚Äôm afraid unless we already know of a civilizations remains were not going to find true archeological evidence. Archaeologists knows this. That‚Äôs why this field is so difficult it seems that Mother Nature has put an artificial cap on us about how much real evidence we can uncover and there‚Äôs no way around it. Unless plate tectonics push them up but that seems highly unlikely.\s\sFyi - The pyramids are a little different they were buried under sand according to the scale above but sand is easily removed and preserves what‚Äôs underneath. El Castillo of Mesoamerica was all but buried under the forest when we found it.Millions of year LOL\s\sJust tell me what the weather is gonna do at least 12 hours from now. Yeah I thought so...Wouldn‚Äôt you like to know weather boyAccording to The World Without Us by Alan Weisman it's possible for bronze items and some types of ceramics to last for most of the predicted future lifespan of the planet. It doesn't specifically say but it seems likely that they would be best protected in stable geologic layers protected from physical erosion by water or sand and not somewhere that will be subsumed back into magna. \s\sThat would be something to look for that didn't seem to have been mentioned in the article.\s\sEdit: I've also read somewhere that some of our mining locations the giant pit mines such as the Bingham Canyon copper mine might be identifiable as at least anomalous (if not necessarily created by a technological species) by future geologists for tens of millions of years depending on how the landscape erodes.Michael Cremo is an author who has studied this.

It seems pretty clear that the kinds of life we have on the surface of Earth have it pretty easy comparatively speaking to possible life elsewhere. It looks like carbon-based life is the logical form to be found but that does not mean there may not be other mechanisms elsewhere. After all the universe has had hundred of millions of years if not billions for random combinations of atoms to form and do something. But anyway the ocean floor is a logical place to look for uncommon life forms although I suspect some trailer parks are also fruitful that wayWe found this at the bottom of the ocean so now we know this must exist on another planet üòÇüòÇYeah didn‚Äôt they find some exotic gonoreah in Antarctica?

Why bury it?Key word suggesting it‚Äôs still all speculation but kind of interesting I guess.As an astrobiology major  I can assure you we will never fully understand life lol can't wait till we find evidence of it elsewhere.Once again scientists have found out that we actually know nothing about life.[deleted]Actually scientists have speculated a lot about stuff like this. It‚Äôs a common thesis that life may have formed on clay minerals at the bottom of the sea floor.We know life needs light. Now we found life doesn‚Äôt need light but oxygen. Now we found that life doesn‚Äôt need light Or oxygen or much of anything.

Who do you think you are?!?!That is some strangeness on a biblical scale. China is the huge persecutor of Christian and other religious minorities. I'm just saying...Grackles normally flock in winter in Texas. Not unusual.It's a government made distraction. What was the biggest thing in china before all of this nonsense? If you answered massive protests for freedom you'd be correct. Now all of the sudden it stopped? What a joke. Governments dont even hide corruption anymore.Except China has been trying to cover this up. They are underreporting the infected and death counts. Airlines have shut down travel to China and neighboring countries are closing or considering closing their borders. Their economy is taking a hit. Why the hell would they do that intentionally?They gona die.km UK ads1sq9eraI'm convinced that crows are planning to kill all humans and take over the planet. I have to wonder if they can smell dead bodies in the dwellings... I really hope not...I kinda believe that with turkey vultures at least.  We semi-joke when the neighbors house is covered with turkey vultures it's probably time to check on them.Like walking into a meat cooler and being struck by the infamous ‚Äúrotting corpse‚Äù smell...only to discover a case of chicken that fell down between the racks...who knows how long ago. Hope you didn‚Äôt want chicken for dinner....YUMI suspect this is what it must be if it's indeed ""a thing""Don't worry crows have an absolute shit sense of smell.One of the theories is that the virus came from bats.  What if the virus is killing a large number of bats which has allowed the mosquito population to boom (perhaps the bats‚Äô main food source)?  Then the crows come in to feast on the mosquitos.  I dunno just a wild guessThat's entirely plausible. Or it could just be a giant coincidence. Either way it does *appear* highly strange if not *somewhat* ominous.They think the virus doesn't actually kill the bats just infects them and spreadsThis is actually not from bats.. you should look at some of the research coming out. This is probably a man made virus and has segments of hybridized genes in it as well and HIV segments. Doctors working for the wuhan disease institute warned their family and friends that there would be a virus coming out and they were fired a few weeks after the outbreak..[deleted]With a current outbreak of Dengue Fever in Brazil & Caribbean Islands (as of Dec. 2019) I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a shortage of mosquitoes anytime soon....As far as the crows it‚Äôs a flesh fest there right right with the mounting corpses.....The virus was manufactured at Harvard from bats. The crows probably are smart enough to know people are sick and are waiting to eat them. The mosquito might be attracted to whatever chemicals were added so it could be easily dispersed.Come join the murder.The Stand but in real life.Watched this last night!Kaw!

Crows are known to scavenge corpses so it could hypothetically be the smell of death they're attracted to and the smell of blood with the mosquitoes presumably. \s\sOr as I said prior it could just be entirely coincidental. Either way not exactly the most re-assuring sight if you were unfortunate enough to be in the area.They can smell death. Would like to know what China isn‚Äôt telling us. Feel like things may be past the point of no return by the time we find out the truth.[deleted]The video of the crows was posted on January 28 2020.

Most likely that isn't the case. Along with thousands of UFO reports there are thousands of eyewitness recounts of abduction by extraterrestrial beings ranging from the usual small Grey aliens to other different looking ones on these UFOs. So if these UFO reports are real these first-hand recounts are probably all real too. No point for a bunch of people all across the world to fake these stories imo.The fact that some of you had to wait for the government and the news' permission to believe or at least entertain the idea of real UFOs is the real joke.We have all the rights to be hipster as fuck regarding UFOs toward the fucking normies.When disclosure finally occurs the army of dedicated debunkers who currently shit up every UFO forum with denialism and scorn are immediately going to start pretending they were believers all along. Like Homer and the Springfield [Isotopes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miQm1lcsCSk).Some people think that if extraterrestrials ever visited Earth how could any of the world's governments keep it a secret from the rest of the population.You're putting way too much trust in the system and that's why I'm telling you that you are naive.\s\sYou are assuming that the system will feed you back all the information and that the scientific community would be on the case.\s\sThere's still a social taboo surrounding this subject and that alone is enough to deter further mainstream investigations.Any way around the pay wall?\s\sEdit: Nevermind.

The whole garlic thing you‚Äôre talking about.I JUST watched a vsause video about the garlic thing!!Wtf?Thats some broken matrix stuff right thereBecause boats and planes totally don't exist.This a beautiful story. So glad she got it back. Someone picked it up where she left it maybe a Finnish tourist or a future tourist to Finland who then went back to Finland where they lost it themselves?There are obviously tribes or even civilizations lost to history of of scant mention that where either taller or shorter than normal sized people of their times.  This can be for various reasons from genes in a small breeding pool diet altitude or other environmental issues.  I often find myself frustrated by the claims of a conspiracy theory based on government raciall or religious reasons to suppress the knowledge of giant or pygmy remains when all cultures and major faiths have tales of such people in their various ""holy stories"".\s\sScience now believes that modern humans have the DNA of 3 different bipedal species.  However remains of only 2 of those 3 have been discovered in the fossil record. The third has been found in the DNA of modern day West Africans. My point being that modern science would be all over any such ""odd"" remains trying to find more physical evidence of missing links in the evolutionary chain.  The scientific community social media and the modern media are both past the point of blindly cooperating with blanket information suppression policies from most countries now in 2020 to keep such breakthroughs secret.Clickbait title. Clearly there‚Äôs nothing secret about thisSecretists *hate* him!New Zealand has no archealogical digs because the Maori people claim that anything that pre-dates European colonisation belongs to them and is ""tapu"" or sacred.  Anyone who questions whether they were the first people to settle New Zealand is called racist even though Maori's own oral histories talk of other races being here long before they came.  It's a PC nightmare and annoys the fuck out of me because proper archeaology done in NZ would be incredibly fascinating considering our unique geographical placement.We deal with the same exact shit in the states. There have been so MANY giant bones found here.Yep they are pretty quick to pull that card out of the deck even if you have absolutely no interest in anything racial and just want to see what people might dig up.Seems interesting. I like reading about the lost races of giants theory. Always entertaining. I shall read more about these guys though. I‚Äôll admit I got a little vexed when they just throw racism out there. If the intent is just to show history has an alternative tale  and not to dispute treaties or show who has a right to the land then the claim of racism is just lore typical bullshit. Stories of giants are pervasive throughout history. Many cultures with many myths. Some spoken as fact some are legends. My friend and I are planning our own trip to dig in America. He has told me the takes as told by his grandfather about the mounds that contain 10‚Äô skeletons. He also told me about a guy that was a lowlife not very well off who used to trade what he described as crazy looking bronze swords and many other items for cash. The guy said he found them in a cave. He would never reveal the location. I trust my friend. As we discover other variations of humans that existed at the same time as modern humans I can‚Äôt help but at least leave it as a possibility.Well said. It is intellectually offensive to accuse someone of racist intent simply because they want to investigate alternative history. It doesn't need to impact existing treaties or social compacts in any way rather to me the accusation of racism is a convenient red button to push in order to shut down a revelation that the historical record is drastically wrong.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sEDIT: What is racism exactly? Accepting the oral history of the Maori as historically accurate where it fits consensus and designating it as folklore embellished through retelling (i.e the wise men tasked with conveying knowledge were prone to arbitrary  exaggeration) when its claims inconvenient?\s\sHere (from OP's article);\s\s>Talk of cover-ups and academic conspiracies frustrates archaeologist  Sian Keith. ""One of our jobs as archaeologists is to assess retrieve  and analyse the data from historic sites"" she says. ""We work with  tangible evidence scientific dating environmental analysis and  **engaging with iwi and hapu who have a rich oral tradition**. There are  many specialists working in the archaeological field who are passionate  and thorough.  \s>  \s>""The evidence for pre-MƒÅori inhabitants of any origin simply isn't  there. If it was the professional community would have identified it  and it would be common knowledge. Archaeologists are not secretive the  work we do is carefully managed under the [Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2014/0026/latest/DLM4005414.html) and investigations and excavations have to be formally reported on.""\s\sSo here is an example of that rich oral tradition;\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>There is the story of Kiharoa a giant of the Ngati-Raukawa and Ngati-Whakatere tribes... The story has it that he was twice the height of an ordinary man and he wielded a hard-wood taiaha of unusual length and weight...It may seem slightly exaggerated; **but let us be generous and allow that he was at least eight feet**.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>There was another giant of these parts long ago one Matau; like  Kiharoa he was a man of the Ngati-Raukawa tribe and too his  favourite weapon was the taiaha. He lived on a hill above the Wairaka River a few miles beyond Orakau. Maori accounts aver that he was **eleven feet high**.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>In the Rotorua country too there are stories no doubt based on fact  of huge warriors of the past. There was the chief Tuhourangi for one;  he lived three centuries ago. **He was nine feet high according to  tradition and was about six feet up to his armpits**. His bones were  buried on the east side of Pukurahi Pa on Mokoia Island above the  present little settlement on the flat.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThe article continues: [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Pom01Lege-t1-body2-d36.html](http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Pom01Lege-t1-body2-d36.html)\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSo you accuse someone of racist undertones for exploring what is literally described in oral tradition? Or is the real racism selectively filtering what parts of the ""rich oral tradition"" are taken seriously and which are dismissed?\s\sAlways dig deeper.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sEDIT 2: Please note the Maori themselves talked of pale skinned (and red haired) ""Fae"" folk that inhabited NZ: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patupaiarehe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patupaiarehe)So the guy was a lowlife because he ""wasn't very well off""?

In case you don't make it back.I haven't watched this documentary yet (going to tonight) but it's an investigation of the legends of pre-Maori settlement of New Zealand including the claim that Celtic giants (well a race of 7 foot tall people) lived here long before Maori arrived whose remains these people are presumably searching for. *New Zealand*: *Skeletons in the Cupboard*  [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf\_inGOubEg*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf_inGOubEg)\s\s[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g15ROUH3gAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g15ROUH3gAQ)\s\sedited previous link to a different upload of the documentary (in two parts) with better audio :)Though you didn't do any favors for my productivity tonight (lol) I wanted to say thanks for those links!

This fungus will evolve according to evolutionary standardsOf course this comes from foxnewsI wonder if mushrooms are growing thereLife uhhhhh finds a wayHaha. Came here to say exactly this.Fuck Jeff Goldbloom man!Crazy when you think you know something and the universe proves you wrong.So does cannabis. When it grows it absorbs the radiation from soil. Paul stamets has some youtube lectures about old world mushrooms and how expired oyster mushroom kits break down oil into usable fungi carbs.Is it edible?[deleted]Anything is edible if your cajones are big enough.How do you eat radiation?Plants have been doing it for \~2000000000 yearsVery carefully.Just like the ones they found that eat plastic.*nom nom nom mmmmmmmm radiation*Engineer it stronger and send to Fukishima.Where it literally grows out of control covering every available space of land. Until a giant fence is erected to stop its growth. Reminiscent of the continental spanning rabbit fence in Australia. All people are evacuated and sent south of the wall. Forever known in Japanese Annals as ""Green Retreat"". A source of national shame and renaming the territory north of the wall ""Moss Chan"".Doesn't surprise me. A bacterium cleaned up lead in the great lakes. Another ate up rust at the Naval Ship yard. There's an eater for every thing.Saw an old doc about fungus it seems that most fungus has a talent for breaking down all sorts of human chemical wastes and renewing the soil back to a state safe for human use. Problem is when these corporate wankers learn of this shit it gives them carte blanche to do whatever they want. Even more so.What if fungii are the ONLY tech left over from previous technologically advanced societies?Paul stamets has been open source copyrighting these I believe.  He calls it mycoremediationThat's awesome! Now if they could cultivate it. Grow it. And send it to Japan. Things can finally start getting cleaned up.First thing I thoughtThis has been known literally for decades.Wonder when the mainstream will finally admit mycoplasma.Mankind has this ignorance of nature and continues to pollute everything and everywhere. Nature is just so incredible always trying to find a way to erase our mistakes. What we need to do is find out what else eats radiation and or radioactive waste by dumping it everywhere like the ocean the rain forest Antarctica and my favorite the Hawaiian islands. Just dump it in the volcanos watch the lava break it down and when it cools down I‚Äôm sure Mother Nature will ‚Äúfind away‚Äù to get rid of it. Maybe sea creatures can absorb radiation or eat radioactive waste and make it safe for everyone. We won‚Äôt know till we try. This could be the first steps in living in harmony with nature.So were these the mushrooms that made Mario big?

I agree would be nice to see footage for once.There are great horned owls in Chicago they have a 5 foot wingspan and I have seen them myself on the lakefront in the daytime (NOT hawks I know the difference). The day I saw one there were wildlife photographers out there with a massive camera and they showed me the owl. It was fucking HUGE and a bit terrifying.

You guys are the worst alien people ever.that .... or a lot of people are new to the topic and are finding out this now by us sharing stories that may be older but are not known by the general public.Always keep in mind that it's possible that what is megastructures for us it's just a structure for them. lot of people assume that alien lifeform is around same size or smaller than human.I want to say that there are physical limits as to how big life can be but I‚Äôm not so sure what the building blocks of alien life would be. DNA? Then there is a limit. Something else? We have no idea..For all we know the whole area of space could be sorta like a petri dish with little things that can live in space like tardigrades just bouncing around maybe 100ft in length. We just wouldn't be able to see them because they wouldn't ever blotch out a whole star or anything and are small enough to not be seen by our shitty telescopes. Maybe we just haven't found the organisms that actually exist and eat each other in space lol If they were there would we even have seen then yet?(please know I do not take this idea seriously)\s\sAlso like we are just.. I see humans as just one step into conscious reality. We are juuuuust enough sentient to know that we are on in a Universe and have a self being confused about what created us. Puts us one notch above the animals but not really. If there are things that can even see 0.05% more of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can pick up with our senses sight taste hearing visual light smelling.. If we could ""see"" even 0.05%(or some other random percentage) of ""it""(being what is actually going on) we would have evolved technologically much faster I assume. And we would also know more about pretty much everything..\s\sThe Universe around us is teaming with shit that we are not even capable of understanding. If something else understands it and is ""higher than us"" it wouldnt even probably care about us? so theyre killing their planet? Who cares... It is alright the planet will just rebuild itself when they wipe themselves out planet will be fine"" . If it experiences time which we do at a certain pace if it experiences it faster what if a few thousand years only feels like one year to a weird tortoise-like interdimensional alien who is sentient? How fast does an ant experience time? They live such a short life does their individual life feel like an entire life? Or does it feel like a few weeks?\s\sThere are just too many questions. So many things are possible... So many.. We are one step above an ape. We know nothing. The closest we even get to seeing more of reality is our meditations psychedelic drugs and other altered states of consciousness.\s\sThis stuff is fun as hell to think about. We make sooo many assumptions on what another intelligent being would be like. And we don't even know. It could very well be something that we literally CANNOT IMAGINE. As in our brains cannot handle the load of understanding and they never would or could. I think that is how we should look at things as being almost entirely blind. Then let the imagination run wild.  Being blind isn't a bad thing it is an interesting thing.If they find a Mass Relay can we all collectively agree on the imminent Reaper threat?'Aaaah the *air quotes*  Reapers'We can't even all collectively agree that we live on a spheroid so good luck.Assuming direct control...I'm signing up for jump zero.

Obviously people are trying to find other intelligent life. It could easily be assumed that there are many fundings of the such.For me it‚Äôs an official acknowledgment of the High Strangeness that I thought was important. I personally wouldn‚Äôt mind if more of this was less strange and more scientifically verified. Not this sub but the phenomenon. I like strange Reddit.This is because of the ruins they found in Antarctica which contain a map to other alien megastructures in our galaxyLink?Lol as if NASA haven't already found this shit.

This is where i want it to go.Lol finally Washington using our money in a way I like.Good better then more tanks the army says they don't need.Also not true. We print so much money every year a massive amount of the money we spend isn't collected from taxpayers. At a macroeconomic scale you don't have an income in costs out budget like that. These are massive systems that literally print their own currency; with a global system of exchange and support on top of all of that. \s\sNot saying its free to do things if your a country. Just that these concepts are significantly more complicated than ""taxpayers pay for it"" to the point that that statement is just objectively falseEditors these days: Let's discredit our own thesis right in the headline. Betcha we still get massive clicks.There‚Äôs no need for megastructures. The Dyson sphere is a glorified solar panel. It even assumes the sun will be the main source of energy. By the time a civilization is capable of making a megastructure it won‚Äôt need it. This reminds me of when people in the 1700s thought they‚Äôd be using balloon vests in the future to walk across lakes. It‚Äôs type zero civ thinking for a type 2 civ.The Dyson ""Sphere"" is a misconception that has filtered through popular media. Freeman Dyson - who formulated the idea - never said it should be a solid shell around a star but a massive ball-shaped swarm of thousands of habitats solar power stations installations etc. which would obscure the light from the star.\s\sSo when you see a ""Dyson sphere"" mentioned think instead about a ""Dyson swarm"" and you have a much more accurate picture in your mind.I loved Civ2.Wouldn't it make more sense for a civilization to make smaller stars to actually power their tech? We already know it's possible to make a star in lab conditions though those only last for brief seconds and requires far more energy to produce than can be retrieved. We need to start thinking outside the box when it comes to searching for intelligent lifeforms.Can‚Äôt believe no one else is talking about this. Dyson spheres are a ridiculous idea. Some sort of megastructure? Maybe. Dyson sphere? No.>There‚Äôs no need for megastructures. The Dyson sphere is a glorified solar panel.\s\sThese statements are two separate discussions. Yes the Dyson sphere concept is probably a redundant one for the reasons you mention. It's like ""We have the imagination to build a sphere larger than our sun but not enough to journey to other stars."" On the other hand Freeman Dyson's idea created discussions and caused SETI researchers to broaden their search terms.\s\sIs the first statement as solid in its logic? Saying there's ""no need"" is a bold comment considering how little certainty there is in the subject. It's not possible to conceive of every circumstance and it's unrealistic to set a limit on the scale of structures for hypothetical civilisations.\s\sThe intermediate stages between populating local planets and travelling to nearby (light years) systems might lead to megastructural way stations and halfway points. Type 2 civilisations could possibly manufacture vessels we'd consider megastructures e.g. our largest vessels are transporters. I imagine that massive vessels will require even larger structures (and infrastructures) to build them. Furthermore there are ideas of ""super computers"" stationed in the spaces between planets where less gravitational pull allows for greater masses.  \s\sIt's a shame the writer chose to put ""Dyson sphere"" in the title as there's no mention in the article.I too considered this.  A Dyson sphere seems ridiculously impractical when you have fusion power at your disposal. Also‚Äî who knows what kind of potential energy sources are available that we just haven‚Äôt discovered?>  This reminds me of when people in the 1700s thought they‚Äôd be using balloon vests in the future to walk across lakes.\s\sThis is hilarious and feels really on point.With the low key talk about ‚Äòzero point energy‚Äô being used from the work of Nikola Tesla and even the US Navy‚Äôs ‚ÄúInertial Mass Reduction Device‚Äù patent a dyson sphere seems way obsolete and impractical to buildI've always thought about this.Ok if that‚Äôs zero civ thinking for type 2 civ. What is the analogous thought that a caveman would have had? Maybe ‚Äúin the future people will find a way to cook food using sun or thunder instead of fire?‚ÄùThe mass of material required for a Dyson sphere is probably a lot more than that of an entire planet.This comment here and scientists with PhD (Permanent Head Damage) actually spending taxpayers money to find Dyson spheres without even thinking.  \s\s\sFun fact aliens are already on Earth why look elsewhere?If NASA did find one of these megastructures do you think the materials used would be same as materials found on earth? Or something completely different and unrecognizable? Like do aliens have a different periodic table of elements? LolI'm no scientist but I assume they probably have a more advanced periodic table and whatever they are building with is probably some sort of alloy thats super durable. Like maybe never go away durable?It does not.  A first step in the right direction at least.  Maybe?Yeah let's just wait another 50 years until they confirm it's about aliensand it says nothing**Strangers**: Read the rules and understand the sub topics listed in the sidebar closely before posting or commenting.

Both led me to nothing in Google. \s\sI live in Denver. Have been to many ""hotspots"" around the state. I have also been to Skinwalker ranch. I want to check this Colorado ranch out. \s\sAnyone have knowledge of where this is?I once saw something crazy in Colorado.  We were supposed to be going to third bridge but we went to the wrong one either way all of our electronics died  or were dying fastand we all felt tired and anxious. When we got out of the car we saw this huge ball of clear matter. If you've ever seen predator it looked like that only about the same size and shape of a beachball. It came out from under the bridge next to where we had parked. We got the hell out of thereIt‚Äôs in north east Utah. 520 miles or so south of Ballard county.

Now it's even on a Bigfoot subBecause we're in a pandemic and people deal with stuff through humour?I get being skeptical I really do. I honestly still kind of am. But when one of the world‚Äôs leading primatologists says that the existence of Bigfoot (or something similar) is not just likely but certain how can there still be people who outright deny it?It's easy to ignore the evidence.  It's easy to ridicule people as crazy or seeking attention.  Some of them may be.  However if you truly look at the totality of evidence with an objective mind it's impossible to deny that there is something out there.  I was a skeptic myself until I really dug into the evidence.  Most people just don't bother looking into it.I agree! \s\sI would love to see a whole documentary with her exploring Bigfoot. Would be absolutely fascinating.> how can there still be people who outright deny it?\s\sA. Cause still there is no proff.\s\sB. A lot of experts have said occasional a really dumb thing or were wrong in their field about something.What was that clip they showed of the sasquatch when she first started talking about it? I have never seen that video before and it looked pretty legit. But the clips they showed for the ufo and loch ness monster were obviously not real so maybe the bigfoot was b.s. too.that looked like a shitty recreation of the OG famous bigfoot footage of him walking back into the forest. I could be wrong thoughLook folks it all boils down to this:\s\s**To prove the existence of Sasquatch you need scientific evidence. Scientific evidence is repeatable evidence!**\s\sVideo evidence might meet that criteria if was clear high resolution and taken on multiple occasions in a given area and made by a videographer with unimpeachable credentials like Jane Goodall.\s\sFootprint evidence you say dermal ridges you say? As a whole somewhat compelling but no single tracks are repeatable enough to meet the criteria. Lots of noise in the data as well because of hoaxers.Yeah - the thing is 'evidence' isn't evidence unless it could hold up in court. I'm not saying I don't believe these things aren't out there - but we need better evidence and the only way of getting that is if somebody sequences a DNA genome or has a body.they cut to a video of a shaky bigfoot footage anyone know what that is from?that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm trying to find out i‚Äôve never seen that clip but it looks really interesting!I would diarrhea right there on the floorI LIKE WHAT YOU GOT. GOOD JOB.Time to get shwiftyBurrito diarrhoeaWhy diarrhea? Maybe you should change up your diet.Came across these today the person who took them stated they are photos of a video taken in 2017 in Bailey Colarado (still waiting on if I can get hold of the original footage). The window was 8ft off the ground.\s\sWill add more information if I can find any.\s\sEdit: The creature was apparently hanging around their property for about two weeks after this encounter.\s\sEdit 2: Apparently the creature was swaying and kept closing it's eyes for long periods of time.\s\sEdit 3: The creature was scared off when his wife came in and screamed.\s\sAlso - I have been told that the original footage was on and SD card that was unfortunately (or conveniently) lost in a house fire. So this is all that remains of the footage.\s\sHoax or not I think they're still very neat photos and it's been interesting seeing how many people got such strong feelings of fear from them.I'd say it looks legit purely because of all the witnesses say they look into their window and the swaying that's really common chimps do that too.This is amazing. Have you been in contact with the person who took the video?[deleted]Wow this really creepy shit !! I mean wtf is this thing !!It was 8ft off the ground üò≥Bigfoot is an arsonistIf it hung around their place for 2 weeks they had time to get lots of additional photos right?Seems to me like a person with body modifications see the tree underdeveloped balls on their forehead and maybe they have nose expanders. Face tattoos and paint. Also the hair has perfect curls no other primate n no wild men  would have non messy hairr\sLooks just like homo sapiens dumbus to meThis just made me very uneasy idk what it is about it but the nerves are real with this picture.Holy shit yes. I couldn't tell what I was looking at at first and as soon as my brain processed it a chill ran down my spineCould that be a built in reaction perhaps out ancestors knew of these creatures and have past on the fright?Likewise It's like being zapped with infrasound in a way very unerving and the feeling when looking at these is very real!The amount of people that find this unsettling is really fascinating and eerie and I wonder if it adds to the credibility of it. Almost like this is tugging at a primal level of fear or uneasiness. To me this is one of the most realistic hoaxes/actual evidence I've seen.I was thinking the same thing It's interesting how many people are immediately freaked out by these images. I was as well they are just so striking and unlike other stuff I've seen which is why I decided to share.If it's a hoax it's a really good one. I just saw the images on my homepage before seeing the title and they made me feel really scared. It was weird.A lot of it's just uncanny valley response. It's something that looks almost-but-not-quite familiar where you can almost-but-not-quite tell what it is you're looking at. That unsettled feeling that urge to look away is your brain getting stuck in a feedback loop trying to sort what it's being fed into a known category.\s\sOnce you spot the nose it stops being quite as unnerving.Ehhh; I don‚Äôt think it necessitates anything in particular with regard to ‚Äúreal v hoax‚Äù. \s\sI mean PGF does the same thing of just hitting that right spot to induce a feeling. Doesn‚Äôt make it more likely real. It‚Äôs just doing that brain thing.\s\sTo me some of these pictures look like bad makeup. Some are utterly terrifying. So who knows.Am I the only one who doesn't find this unsettling?I think it's kinda adorable.Nothing can really add any credibility to pictures that are this amazingly shitty.Those eyes...üò¨\sThanks I hate it!It‚Äôs very unsettling especially the top left! if it‚Äôs a hoax it‚Äôs a unique one after seeing this I think I more prefer the gorilla looking ones to this humanoid beastIt really is! Especially since I‚Äôve heard so many accounts describing creatures that look like this ‚Äî like a caveman basically with a flattened nose and black eyes.You mean the top right?Well this is certainly unsettling.\s\sI'm having trouble comprehending the bottom center picture. Does it have its nose pressed against the window?From what I see - the nose is beneath the window ledge and it's eyes are closed.The person who took the video should post SCREENGRABS or THE ACTUAL VIDEO. Anytime a photo of a TV screen or monitor is shown instead it screams fake. Taking pics of a screen creates artifacts and other imperfections leaving the viewer to fill in the blanks because the image is not clear so we see what we want.Print it on a t-shirt and take a photo of it with an old Motorola flip phone... Enhance!!!If its a hoax its one of the best onesDamn this gave me shivers!  Real or not it triggered something in me.I'll say this much . that nose is spot on. Ive never seen one in real life but about 90% of the eye witness reports ive heard talk about the Sasquatch having a ""large  flat  pushed in nose."" As well as the skin color being ""battleship grey"". I too get a very creepy vibe from this one.If I woke up to that looking in my window I think I would pass out.And then after you wake up a few seconds later notice it's gone but hear the front door bust openIt looks like a California raisinHe heard it through the ape vine.RemindMe! 7 days ‚Äúsquatch‚ÄùI will be messaging you in 4 days on [**2020-03-21 09:49:57 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-03-21%2009:49:57%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/bigfoot/comments/fifv14/supposedly_taken_in_bailey_colorado_in_2017/fkgxn6w/?context=3)\s\s[**11 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fbigfoot%2Fcomments%2Ffifv14%2Fsupposedly_taken_in_bailey_colorado_in_2017%2Ffkgxn6w%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202020-03-21%2009%3A49%3A57%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\s\s^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20fifv14)\s\s*****\s\s|[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\s|-|-|-|-|I second the chills/uneasy feeling. But where exactly do these come from? Not ""someone took these in Colorado in 2017"" but how did OP find them? Email? Is there a website or article they were originally posted to? Even a blogpost?\s\sI googled ""Colorado Bigfoot 2017"" and while these images did not show up one did. One that at first I chalked up to pareidolia until I realized the ""face"" is eerily similar to the one in these photos. Not saying the same animal but same species. But it could also still very well be pareidolia.\s\sRegardless of that article my initial point still stands. Do we have a known original source for these images?\s\sEDIT: I also attempted to reverse image search this with no results.OP replied to a similar message stating he found them off of a Facebook post.I don't have much more information other than ""someone took these in Colorado in 2017"". And as I stated in previous comments I found them on a Facebook post yesterday where they had been posted for the first time so you wouldn't get anything from reverse image searching.\s\sSee my other comments if you want more info - I've provided everything the person who took them shared (which isn't much sadly).if u scroll thru here there is a facebook group link that links to the OP and the entire backstoryIn depth debunking here: https://squatchdetective.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/peeping-bigfoot-part-ii/Can any actual witnesses confirm that this is how they look?I started tearing up when I seen this. Gave off such a eerie vibe. I‚Äôm not gonna deny that this is real. Let‚Äôs be honest something we haven‚Äôt seen and actually get to see that we can‚Äôt comprehend our mind will do it‚Äôs best to convince us it‚Äôs fake simply bc we can‚Äôt comprehend. That made my hair stand upFor real tho im tearing up too when getting eerie vibes and cant find any info why that happensI like your explanation of the human psychology when it comes to things that ""shouldn't"" exist. Instead of letting their reality (that they have built up to this point in time) come shattering down or become fractured plague their mind most human will deny such a creature or thing's existence. Kinda gives more credibility to Lovecraft's stories where people go insane when they become psychologically conflicted from experiencing things they have seen that should be impossible...I find the opposite happens actually. I find a lot of people tend to think things are more supernatural than they actually are. Just looking at the comments on a glacier calving video and many people were absolutely convinced that some massive whale like animal was in the ice because of different colors of ice being underwater vs. Being covered in snow on top.Terrifying was the first thought that popped into my brain after it finally let me see what‚Äôs in these photos. The being/creature/(maybe human?)seems to be using its nose to be smelling something. Maybe the pheromones  emitted from the person/people inside are attracting it? Seems like it‚Äôs in a trance and if it was swaying then the pheromones could be having an effect on its neurology or something who knows right? That is... if it‚Äôs real. Pretty convincing to me. Seems to be something they‚Äôd do.. if they are really there.Could it be a curios bear looking for food?  Black bears can reach up to 8 feet in height on their hind legs sometimes higher.  It looks to me like a bear peeking in to see if there are any goodies.Wow talk about an extreme case of cognitive dissonance lol.The pictures looked like they were taken from footage on a TV or computer screen. Where did you get the pictures?They are camera pictures of a video that was taken in 2017. They were posted to facebook.I think this was from a video where the homeowner thought someone was coming around and stealing the fruit from his tree. This is pretty creepy.Were you thinking of [this video](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/W9LljI6) or a different one? This one also freaks me out a bit ‚Äî something about how quickly the glowing eyes dart back and forth just sets my teeth on edge.They always look sad to me.  I would offer him/her a bag of potatoes.I read one account (I forget where) in which a woman became somewhat familiar with a family of Sasquatches near her property and would set out food like apples and peanut butter sandwiches for them. Apparently they liked sandwiches made with wheat bread but ignored the sandwiches made with white bread. It‚Äôs probably just a work of fiction but it made me laugh all the same.STOP I HATE IT THIS SENT MY ANXIETY THROUGH THE ROOF\s\sit‚Äôs 5am and i‚Äôm holding back tears looking at that thing goddamnSorry it spooked you I hope you're okay.I love that feeling when I get so spooked that my eyes begin to water.Goddamn thing\sFTFYThis was wild I couldn't tell what I was looking at but when I did a shiver ran down my whole bodyWithout seeing the video or actual screen-grabs (which both aspects of that are iffy to start with) take a good close look at that nose. Seems a touch ... off.\s\sThe rest is easy enough to costume makeup and those BEK contacts. But prosthetics are a whole different level. And the nose just seems ‚Äòshopped to me. \s\sStill the most neat thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub in quite some time!! Thanks for sharing!!If the person can‚Äôt give you the full video it‚Äôs bs.\s\sKeep us posted though!I wonder if bigfoot can get diseases from humans. Maybe the poor thing had the flu.I‚Äôve heard it speculated that one of the reasons they are so scared of us is maybe one of our diseases reduced their numbers in the past like smallpox.Gotta admit that it‚Äôs kind of unsettling but I‚Äôm happy to see our big feet buddy.Really wish we could get the actual images rather than this screen photographed BS.Unfortunately that's how I came across these and how they were originally posted to facebook. I would also love the stills or even better the video they are supposedly from.Very unsettling. Those eyes....the swaying reports always unsettle me tooI will shit in my best and most expensive pants if I have to encounter that thingIt‚Äôs kind of cute in a creepy way. Whatever is out there has a heck of a honker. But seriously do I see evidence of a sagittal crest? One thing I‚Äôve read over and over is that a Sasquatch‚Äôs head is kind of tapered. Makes total sense if the Sasquatch people eat a lot of difficult to chew things like nuts.Peeping Tomüò±These look amazing can‚Äôt wait to see a video!Read other comments in the thread. OP said the video was burned in a house fire.Awww that top right one with those black eyes peering in is pretty creepy! These are really interesting though (although they are pretty fuzzy - why anyone cant actually get a crisp clean zoomed in shot with the smartphones we have these days still makes me suspicious)Smart phone cameras are wonky at best.

Well that's one of them.Hola fack!!!!Wheres the original photo? And contextLooks like the guy from Abominable! You know the one that bit that guy's face off like an appleThe Sasquatch Outpost is in Bailey been there a bunch since it's easy to get to from Denver. While there's definitely reports around there and throughout the Rockies it's a pretty convenient place to claim as the source of these shots especially if you're a hoaxer trying to gain some notoriety from a nearby Bigfoot museum.Top right is gonna give me nightmaresIt's 2020. Where's the footage?I don't know it seems a little convenient that one camera flash wouldn't scare it away. However it doesn't look like a mask.I second the chills everyone has mentioned. This terrified me something about the eyes is malevolent. \sAnd the fact OP mentioned it stayed still and swayed??? \sW T F. Hypnotism?This. This is why I live on a second story apartment and sleep with a shot gun.Update - So apparently the original footage was on an SD card that was in a house fire and these photos were taken before said fire. Make of that what you will.\s\sI still think these are neat pictures hoax or not!Ehh doesn't scare me. Just looks like a curious unidentified creature. Good chance it's fake anyway especially with the house where the original footage was kept being burned down.Oh wow... I don't have words. It's nearly impossible to say if it's real or not but it definitely hits something primal in me.Oof. r/TIHI. Gives off reallllll creepy vibes. I'm going to say it's a hoax buuuut a damn good one. Would be cool to see if the original video could be obtained.he is just having a little peek!Sasquatch: Hey bro just a friendly reminder that only you can prevent wildfires.Sorry everyone I really wanted to believe this one but Sasquatch Detective did a pretty in depth and convincing debunking: https://squatchdetective.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/peeping-bigfoot-part-ii/I might be wrong but bottom middle looks like the jack links commercial ""Bigfoot"".Kinda looks like an undead Mario with a bandana and buck teeth I def don't want to encounter that thing ever yikes.Can one of our artist friends please draw this version of Mario?\sStatSent a message to the original photo taker to learn more and to get his side of things. \s\sI'll share whatever I learn here.This is somehow one of the most terrifying bigfoot photos I've seen. The one on the top right creeps me out the most for some reason maybe because it's looking straight at the camera.This picture freaked me the fuck out when I saw it. Especially the top right picture. So then to make myself not as scared (and to scare my friends) I've begun using it as a chat sticker. Quite fun.I'm sorry what the fuck...?!creepyIt almost like like an absolutely massive pig nose lmaoSome creative guy put a digital cut out wide nose on a photo of some dude in adobe and used opacity setting to place it in another separate photo of the window. The nose has been smeared on for blending  Its a hoax sorry. \sI am not a non-believer at all just an adobe expert. I hate bad BS like this.Real or not Bigfoot or not I‚Äôd still be terrified if I saw this looking at me through my window. It could be a person and I‚Äôd still be terrified.What is with these pictures having such an odd effect on people? It definitely makes me feel uneasy as well. Those eyes are something else especially if it is some hoax..Look at the critter upside down and you‚Äôll see why it looks so weird.Scary as shit but it looks like a guy in black face with scleras lensesI think they‚Äôre cute although dumb because cmon don‚Äôt be peaking in people‚Äôs windows.\s\sEdit- I remembered that cats slow blink when they‚Äôre communicating ease and friendliness with you.My immediate thought is that I'm looking at the end of a dog's snout. Like when my dog is in my face waking me up in the morning. Given that it's 8 feet up is it possible it's a bear standing on 2 feet?Exactly. The shine above the ""face"" is the eyes of the dog and what looks like a face is the black nose of the dog. The 8 feet up is of course BS it's likely the frame of a patio door or something with the dog looking in.maybe from an indie film?Hello it me :3Wow that looks real that nose is big and those eyes oh my completely blacked out üò© i want to hug one but i would also be too scared too. They seem so cute how interested they seem when watching us ü•∞Noooooope. That is no Bigfoot that is definitely [SCP-106](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-106).Than it's easier to be SCP 1000I read the videos were supposedly lost in a house fire.Honestly the faces look like they could be CG renders. With the cellphone-picture-of-TV pictures we have here there's just no way of telling. Until somebody posts the original source I'm leaning toward hoax.That nose is bizarre. I thought it was African American type but if you look closer it doesn't feel it's human so... The face have some human features but also animal features. The skin is grey or burned the eyes are unsettling if its a hoax it's a very good job... You can't even tell the gender even if I will bet for this creature to be female.\s\sThe man claimed the smell was horrible and that drew his attention to this thing. You can hear other witnesses saying the same thing not only about Bigfoot and co but spirits.[deleted]I hate to be a downer but I think this is pareidolia. To me that looks less like a primate face and more like the snout of a hog shoving its face up against a window. I don't think those are eyes I'm pretty sure they're nostrils. \sThe scale compared to the size of the window and blinds feels wrong to me as well.Yes. Same. Exactly.Since when do hogs have forward facing eyes?How come we never see any fossils of these guys are they aliens in disguise?For comparison the first chimpanzee fossil was found in 2005 and consisted of a few teeth.funny you should mention that...lots of people dismiss the stranger encounters but they all follow the same bizarre criteriaRemindMe! 5 daysIt's the wookalar.Does anyone else think it looks like it's wearing some kind of headband? A strip darker than the rest of the forehead is visible across the forehead and in some of the pics (especially top center) the hair seems to have an impression in it in line with that strip like a headband pressing the hair down.üòÇLooks like a pig snoutIt‚Äôs definitely unnerving but assuming that Bigfoot is just a subspecies of ape makes it slightly less so. Gorillas and orangutans are generally pretty docile creatures so we can presume that Bigfeet would likely be similar in behavior unless of course they feel threatened.Cant make up my mind. Looks a lot like a guy with ""pearlings"" on his forehead some facial tattoos long unkempt hair and eyeballs tattooed black.Sasquatch are known to peak into windows occasionally. The reasons are unknown.Y‚Äôall are right. I forgot that houses are sometimes cinder blocks stilts etc. I live in big city where that doesn‚Äôt happen. But the full video has to be released before we can take this seriously. I know it‚Äôs apparently ‚Äúshaky‚Äù but that has to be analyzed.Top left looks like a nose up against the window... are those Nostrils.....Yeah doesn‚Äôt look fake at all...Any news on this?Yes it was fake.Thought it was a pig nose at first....holy crap this is terrifyingWhy would you put him in a microvawe?Man it's too bad that footage was lost... Really cool photos though!MAN I DON'T LIKE THATThat‚Äôs a man\s\sEdit: nevermind. Can‚Äôt decipher that middle bottom image.That‚Äôs just a really big and pissed off slug manThat‚Äôs just Bam Margera‚Äôs evil twin zombie brother who went missing 15 years ago.I'm an abductee.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThis scares the shit outta me.Do tell...I don‚Äôt know why people are seeing Bear. You can clearly see the humanoid nose especially on the bottom right then the eyes above itThe hoaxes never end!I think it would have to be a hoax because the top right one you see there is light reflected from the iris but not the rest of the eye as you would expect with an animal. In other words there isn‚Äôt any eye shine. \s\sStill creepy though.So the fact that there is an eye reflection would say to me that this is real. You dont see eye reflection on all photos of actual people. I don't know why you would think that there has to be eye reflection on all of these.That my friends is a black bearDamn. It kinda resembles a Native AmericanIt isn't a bear you snow flakes!Whatever this is it clearly is NOT a bear!I think that's George FloydSome of the photos just look overtly human. Paint on face just like the camo style you see in movies and with military stuff... That kills it for me.It looks like a dog‚Äôs nose to meBailey‚Äôs too close to Denver to be super believableI would try to communicate. If it kills me I don‚Äôt have to make loan payments.I would shit my pants if I saw thatSo now Bigfoot wears a backwards ball cap? You can clearly see the strap across his forehead ü§î Still a scary looking dude to look through your windows!Silly idea. People hunting a man shaped thing?\s\sMore hunting deaths would be a result. Idiots already take other hunters for deer. And a deer does not resemble a person at all.That's exactly the reasoning behind the ban on Bigfoot hunting in Washington.If people are mistaking people for deer then people are probably mistaking other things too... hmmmmmmmm Dick Cheney is so disappointed rnSee he's not trying to kill Bigfoot only trap him. Now its not crazy.it's* not crazy\s\s    it's = it is or it has\s    its = the next word or phrase belongs to it\s\sThe contraction gets the apostrophe.Not what I expected from the headline. I‚Äôd assumed they‚Äôd banned hunting them and that‚Äôs why people are upset. \s\sGotta say I really don‚Äôt think this is a good idea. Aside from the potential dangers of the alleged creatures (especially with people who probably don‚Äôt know much about the subject or the potential dangers involved) this could lead to people shooting at other people that they misidentify as being sasquatch. They shouldn‚Äôt be trying to promote tourism at all during a crazy pandemic. Pretty stupid idea all-aroundIts a trapping only hunt. No guns involved.I‚Äôm assuming people would have to pay for a Bigfoot-hunting license? If so then this is definitely a scam to raise money for the state.DING! DING! DING! We have a winner!The citizens here hate taxes so goddamn much that they won't even raise their sales tax by a penny to fund programs that will help raise them from the hellish existence that is Oklahoma. They will however buy hunting and fishing licenses so this is the easiest way for them to raise any money in this hell-hole.I mean it‚Äôs not a scam. It‚Äôs clearly intended to promote tourism and people will get exactly what they paid for.So they want to ‚Äútrap‚Äù a 7-12 ft. 800-1000lb thing that can snap trees in half...with no gun. Mmmm üëåMy thoughts exactly.So there are no other pressing problems in Oklahoma than bigfoot? Typical politician now all eyes are on him vote him out get someone more serious than this mental giant.Oklahoma the florida of the Midwest ...jeezOklahoma belongs to the south the midwest already has Nebraska/Iowa/Missouri. No thank you to Oklahoma.Bigfoot has rights as well. He has the right to live in his woods in peace just like anyone else. lolnah ain't buyin this bsThe thing about this is that the law in that there is an anti-hunting one in Washington.  The one in ~~Oregon~~ Washington is so that when people go out hunting they don't shoot a person that is mistaken for a Bigfoot.> The thing about this is that the law in that there is an anti-hunting one in Washington. \s\sWhile I agree with the sentiment this confusing jumble is disappointing coming from a wordologist such as yourself who is correcting several others IN THIS VERY THREAD. \s\s‚ÄúPractice what you preach.‚Äù -TestamentSorry i'm European and hence do not understand the idea of killing that (probably not existing) thing:\s\sWhy would you want to hunt/kill it at all?\s\s\- is it self defence? did it kill people? did it choke some cattle to death? does carry guns sell drugs ...?\s\s\- or is that you want to put the head as a trophy the wall of your cottage (which stands in the wild because you ""love"" nature)\s\s\- or because it is unknown and different? so it has to die because it's not according the the local standard?\s\s\- or would u want to make money out of hunting licenses?\s\sA scientific approach (*OMG did i say scientific in a bigfoot subreddit?!*) would make more senseThe idea is that it can't be real if there never are any body parts found.  So by killing one you can at least get part of a body.  Not many people will carry an 800 lb. animal carcass back to their truck.\s\sAnother reason is why it can't be identified through DNA matches. DNA matches have to be made against the DNA sampled from *known* species.  Otherwise there's no known sample to match to.\s\sThose are scientific approaches by the way.That's cute. I don't know why everyone is so upset it's not like there is a bigfoot to shoot.Thousands of eyewitness reports say otherwiseThere are a lot of reports from Oklahoma."

That is child mutilationBruh... don‚Äôt do drugs??AyyyGiggity. Yonaguni Monument underwater rock structure that was discovered in the mid-1980s near Yonaguni Island Japan. The massive underwater rock formation is thought to have existed for more than 10000 years. But whether it was completely man-made natural or altered by human hands is still a matter of debate. The theory is that the ancient underwater city was probably sunk by an earthquake or tsunami around 2000 years ago. Nevertheless this massive pyramid draws curious scuba divers from all over the world for obvious reasons.Where is there recording of it? Come on Japan has had archives for much longer. Dating it according to the WIKI is an exercise in stupidity. It suggests more recent than the 2000 years mark. Since it has been rediscovered since the 70-80s possibly prior to that. Although aired again recently instead of the natural formations attempted. Where there have been others discovered off of Japan more recently. \s\sAlthough Japan is located on massive seismic geology quakes and volcanoes where Godzilla the divine catfish krakens.\s\sYou'd honestly think there would have been another record. At least within the last 2000 years of Japanese history? Apart from the speculation if it isn't indeed older.I bet that butt shot helps with the viewsMany underwater cities that the authorities keep under wrapsActually they don't. If anything they just try to explain them away when brought up.They work with what they have. But just because you can't carbon date stone doesn't mean you attribute a structure to the last visitors or vagrants that left their trash there\s\sIf the world ended today and all that was left were the same things left by the earth's previous civilization. Those future archaeologists would find plastic bottles at the base of the Great Pyramid and decide the plastic makers built them.\s\s....also not every building with stone carvings was a friggin temple.>They work with what they have\s\sThey only work with what fits into their box. Evidence is often ignored because it points to things that they don't want to recognize.\sIn ten thousand years they will believe that we worshipped Coke.AliensWe are hybrids!The fossil record is but a very very tiny glimpse of extinct fauna.\sA fossil is created by phenomenal odds. \sMost extinct species will never make it to the fossil record.\sThat makes the fossil record irrelevant in attempting to prove human origin. Or any origin. Or evolutional processes changes and mutations.\sSo it will not be compatible.\sI have more faith in documented records. \sThe fossil record is unreliable.\sPeriod.By documented records do you mean human books/artifacts/histories?\s\sBecause those have at least as many problems as you point out for the fossil record (in addition to being subjectively created items and other things). \s\sWatch: The record of surviving documents is but a very very tiny glimpse of past history. A historical document is created by phenomenal odds. Most past documents will never make it to the historical record.\s\sSo why do you have more faith in documented records?In other words they cannot use the fossil record to account for all extinct species of hominids. They are still discovering new species all the time.\sThey still havent found the missing link.\sAnd they wont.\sCompare human skeletons to any fossil hominid skeleton. Our closest similarity is Neanderthals. All other hominids have totally different bone structure and density.\sThe rib cages of homo sapiens and everything else is completely reversed. Theyre upside down of each other. Other hominids bone density is twice as robust and heavier.\sThere isnt enough time to evolve to what we are from what they were.\sThat points to alternative origins itself.The fossil record cannot account for all extinct species of *any* organism group. They are discovering new members of groups all the time. The ""missing link"" idea [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_link_(human_evolution)) [not](https://www.britannica.com/science/missing-link) how evolutionary theory works.\s\sDo you doubt general agreements about other organism groups - like horses or whales or birds? The problems listed here are not so different from other debates in studies of organism groups' fossil records.>There isnt enough time to evolve to what we are from what they were.\s\sIt really only took us a few 100000 years to get from ""them"" to ""us"" which in evolutionary time frames is extraordinary. And in that same time frame half a dozen of our relatively similar cousin species went extinct/we killed them off and we went from living in caves to taking over the whole world. Are there any other examples of a species having even *close* to such a fast upward mobility in the food chain in present or past time periods? I can't think of any.I agree with your first sentences but just want to point out that all Neanderthal bones have been extremely dense! Much more dense than any other living hominids at that time/ us today. Most articles seem to agree that they were six times stronger than humans and needed denser bones to support their extra muscle mass.And if I remember correctly the first hominids with jaws that could speak were when hominids began working together to solve problems.This also happens in Egyptology.  The evidence doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into the official narrative that Egyptian Bureau of Antiquities perpetuates.\s\sI‚Äôve also heard that some early remains discovered in the US and Canada contradict the official history taught there (example: some Caucasian remains that predate the earliest known Native remains) but that such findings have literally been buried because indigenous peoples automatically get to claim them as ancestors and take possession... and it wouldn‚Äôt benefit ‚ÄúFirst Peoples‚Äù if there were questions about which people settled which lands in prehistory; it could be used as grounds to remove some of their special rights and they‚Äôve been screwed by the white man enough that you really can‚Äôt blame them.Its because there are huge political implications. Not just the natives or Egypt but also the Maori-first claims of New Zealand or the more blatant China heavily fudging history and claiming neighboring cultures and historical sites as theirs too.\s\sWith historical narrative comes claiming rights and sadly from there the issue is no longer confined to academia alone.ITT: Given an inch and take a mile""I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE""!

Among their incredible finds was the discovery of a man who was the product of incest in a 5200-year-old Newgrange structure in Ireland. Experts extracted DNA from the remains and noticed that it showed an unusually high number of identical versions of the same genes. This pattern suggests that his parents are either siblings or parents and child.The Irish had royals?!We had it all before the EnglishWe hear about these stories in the old Testament of Genesis.

This video was done wellthanks alotReally well done thank you!SnakeIf you look at the drake equation and contemplate the time span that the universe has been around ~15bn years there should be numerous alien species around that are far more advanced than us. Chances are aliens have been on/aware of this planet for millions of years. The sumerian tablets say the annunaki (an alien species from another star system) genetically modified a developing homonin on earth and that's who we are today. Seems reasonable if you think of the vastness of space and time but still people will laugh it off.they arent reptillian they are eagles. look up the story of enki and enlil. aslo the great inversion is a genius trick by devil as it makes the good guylook evil.The Ubaid era pre-Sumerian ( likely one of the tribes that joined with other nomads to become Sumerian) has numerous humanoid figurines with lizard/reptilian/serpent heads.  It is very possible this is the origin of the legends of serpents that gifted humans with various types of knowledge.  Enki was said to look particularly serpent like. Then came dragons feathered serpents etc. and the rest as they say is history.So do you just bounce between these different sheroze accounts and spam trash?Not aliens its all demonic anywaysAs a former fundamental Christian I really want the aliens are demons theory to be true. It makes things a lot easier to just explain all this alien stuff as demonic. But now I‚Äôm conflicted because if there is even the tinniest possibility real intelligent aliens exist then this Annunaki stuff is a very compelling explanation for our origins as genetically modified in some way.demonic??! ü§£lmfao don't drink the kool aidSummary. Now. The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in the state capital of Kerala India. The temple is named the richest temple in the whole world as it is covered in gold.

A large number of treasure was found locked away in the five vaults including gold silver diamonds and other precious stones.Perhaps these are similar to the Giants spoken of in the Old Testament and times of pre FloodI just did a podcast about this topic!

I believe some even grew bigger\s\sAlso lots of skulls found which had double rows of teeth. A lot of stuff is kept hidden from usWhen they say double rows I always wonder if they mean like shark mouths or like a child‚Äôs skull that has baby teeth with adult teeth beneathLots of BS yeah. But nothing that qualifies as legitimate evidence.Red/Brunette hair isn't an unknown among Mongol or Negro ethnicities. It isn't exclusive to Caucasians. There are also many genetic anomalies such as Gigantism Cherubism and Acromegaly that could explain their unusual size and appearance.[deleted]Nothing at all to do with evolution.ouch...There are dozens of accounts of red haired giants living in the US territory before the Europeans arrived. Both by historians as well as depicted on official maps (in one map they are even described as cannibalistic).\s\sI don‚Äôt know if these particular skulls are legit but there is plenty of evidence to support the premise that giants once occupied the US territories.Probably a next gen evolution some of our ancestors killed off before they got prevalentSounds like the nephilimPlease please share one of these credible accounts.

There were never any bones. There are no native tales of giants. It‚Äôs entirely a creation of paranormal writers.\s\shttps://skeptoid.com/episodes/4390I saw an interesting video series a while back posing the idea that all these giant skulls were from early human denisovan hybrids. From the teeth found with denisovan dna it definitely seems possible these were just proto humans that all died offIt‚Äôs a shame considering numerous accounts and other evidence that hold validity..despite Smithsonian propaganda and suppression..this kind of shit is an embarrassment and sheds negative light on an otherwise thought provoking and monumental discussion of human historyThe SimpsonsThey've not aged well"

The Spanish Air Force declassified 55 UFO sightings but only four ever received a full investigation ([list here](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=137829)).\s\sGallarta was one of them where a carpenter named Juan Sillero claimed a disc-shaped craft landed near his rural home five times one of which he went on board and spoke with the ""beings.""  Among the things he claims he observed:\s\s&#x200B;\s\s* the disc seemed to be collecting samples of the ground\s* onboard there was a circular console with a red sphere in the middle that ""lit up"" when Spanish Air Force jets approached\s* the beings communicated telepathically with him\s* the beings he observed that didn't communicate to him were grunting to each other and waving their arms exaggeratedly\s* they warned him Earth's axis was ""tilting too much"" something NASA has recently analyzed due to Greenland ice melt and mantle convection (though they aren't worried about it)\s\sIt's a wild story but the Air Force concluded he was a reliable witness and was consistent in his re-tellings.  They ultimately didn't conclude anything landed due to a lack of physical evidence.\s\sYears later an official from that Air Region told journalist JJ Benitez (who covered Juan's case) that there were anomalous radar returns those nights in 1977 and they did scramble jets twice to check it out.  Curiously any mention of radar returns is omitted from the Gallarta case file despite the Spanish military disclosing this information for other sightings.\s\sFull case file (in Spanish): [http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp\_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda\_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886)The planet Earth is spinning out of it's orbit better tell a random carpenter.Jesus was a carpenter.I'm tired and read that as a caterpillar went on board and wondered why they told him that.... and that explains MothmanThis video: \s\sHe asked for a souvenir and they gave him a special thingamajig.\s\sBut I'm sure that's not important so let's just forget we mentioned it.Best fucking paranormal channel on YT rn.

Because I can never seem to find a straight forward non rambling answer and I‚Äôm super fascinated in the man and his ideas.Do they pinpoint people who do something about it or did they know their visits would be seen as hostile by limited beings and their message hidden from the masses?Thanks for sharing :)Guys yeah. There are aliens that come to this planet but what are they here for? Every country or almost every country has its story with it. I suppose they come here to study just like we study biology history and arts. Why governments deny their presence? Why do they make such a deal out of it?They thought he could use his carpentry skills to build a space ark.So this leads me to another theory. If they know that the name of the planet is Earth what is the explanation for this? They are either us (from the future) or someone told them. Because in reality science only gives planets and any matter a name.The phenomenon offers a vision where ‚ÄúThey‚Äù often communicate telepathically. If something could read your mind it could know everything you do.I believe they are us from the future.

You hear about the thousands of people who claim they saw aliens or were abducted you don't hear so much about the thousands of stories of the men who follow\s\sEdit: everyone asking if I remember correctly it was I believe The real Men in Black by Nick Redfern. All my books are currently packed away in storage so I can't be entirely sure.Where can I find this book?Do you know the name of the book?Hey. Do you know the Name of the book?There's a MIB encounter that I read on the Internet a long time ago and sadly cannot find anymore. Here's the gist of it:\s\s1. The poster claimed that for LOLZ he most a post on some forum about seeing a UFO crash near his house and gave a specific location. \s2. The specific location was along a riverbed. There was only one walking track near the location.\s3. The poster stayed at the location to see what would happen. A MIB came past and they briefly spoke then the MIB walked off. Within a few minutes an identical looking MIB came by and walked the exact same way. There was no way that the first MIB could have come back in that time to do that.Sounds made up imoDoctor who?Where?I always wondered why UFO design descriptions along the decades also had a clearly line of design that is improving as ourselves as society had our asthetics being improved on what looks like the same rate of change. Maybe all UFO is a big subjective experience and the mind interpretation of the individual has a bigger role or maybe it is the greatest hoax ever.It could be that what they saw was so unbelievable that they have no frame of reference so they try to explain it using relatable things from the time.I strongly suggest the novel Roadside Picnic and the film based on it Stalker. The novel is about the aftermath of aliens visiting earth and the title is a metaphor for how if aliens visited they would likely not pay us any mind and leave behind junk like one might after a picnic. However because this ‚Äújunk‚Äù may be so far advanced for us we are fascinated and even unable to comprehend it.\s\sThe movie though in Russian is possibly my favourite movie ever. I warn you it‚Äôs incredibly slow but it‚Äôs amazing. It doesn‚Äôt really have much to do with the book but both are great!The Vallee-Keel hypothesis is more like ""ultaterrestrials have their own agendas and ideas and don't care too much about 'passing' here too much.""\s\sIts explored in Passport to Magonia from an early UFO sightings perspective but I feel Keel's Operation Trojan Horse does a better job explaining it.Here is the newspaper article: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5855523/first-hand-account/](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5855523/first-hand-account/)\s\s\^The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported his friends deemed the witness reliable.  There were dozens of other phantom airship sightings throughout 1897 including several where voices inside the craft were heard: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20173722?read-now=1&seq=2#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20173722?read-now=1&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)what if these ships in the past were actually us in the future trying to find ourselves in the present?I‚Äôve wondered about this exact hypothesis for so long. Glad to see someone else consider it too.That's what I've been saying all along UFO's are time machines!!!In 1897 also this [happened](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Texas_UFO_incident)  in Aurora TexasOw thats amazing! I would have loved to have gone and picked up a piece. I wonder what happened to the pieces? as it said lots of people were going out to collect them...What the hell does the picture have to do with this?It's a videoit only makes sense to believe that in the future our calculations are skewed/incorrect ones we derive from technology for space/time travel to meet ourselves before times recorded or recorded. science is made of factual events or plausible scenarios that have some sort of fact. i like the idea of inter dimensional beings moving through space and time that met our selves once before but it makes greater sense to believe we humans made leaps to go back in time to replace events for better ones. climate change world wars political takeovers etc. something about human nature and fixing our problems seems more heroic than abandoning life on our ‚Äúso called‚Äù terrestrial first world.In the romantic world of writing a good story maybe.  Real world it would be more like elon musk opening a portal to a safe reality for him and 30 billionairesThis opens the doors to two things: collective consciousness and metaphysical entities. It is possible for a group of people to experience something of an imagination together. It happens all the time in religion and could explain why UFOs mutate with the ages. The disturbing part in my opinion is that if these beings are metaphysical transcending our universe and dimension and are able to project whatever images into the witnesses mind‚Äôs we then are unable to understand them and considering their technology unable to protect ourselves from them.nicely written.Considering it didn‚Äôt have a spout I‚Äôm pretty sure it should be classified as a ‚ÄòGrotesque‚Äô instead of a gargoyle ü§îü§îConfirmed fantasist.

Didn't know I was in so deepHighly entertaining thank you!  I recall seeing a documentary or maybe it was a show like 60 minutes about a dozen years ago in which a contemporary of Patterson & Gimlin‚Äôs came forward and claimed to be the man in an ape suit.  In the show they even had him put on a hairy suit and walk the same path.  He did walk exactly like the Patty.  It seemed like a convincing debunking but today it seems as if the P/G film is considered a strong piece of evidence.  Do you know of the one I recall and what came of it?You should look into a more detailed breakdown of the P/G Film. There‚Äôs a lot more information that‚Äôs discernible from that video than a guy walking in a certain way. I recommend you check this out:  \s\shttps://www.isu.edu/media/libraries/rhi/research-papers/Munns--Meldrum-Final-draft.pdf\s\shttps://www.isu.edu/media/libraries/rhi/comments-amp-responses/Munns-&-Meldrum-Commentary_2013.pdf\s\sNo one who‚Äôs come forward claiming to be Patty has put forth a shred of evidence. They don‚Äôt have the suit they don‚Äôt have a picture of themselves in the suit and they can never get anyone to corroborate their allegations. That means it‚Äôs always their word against Patterson and Gimlin. \s\sPatterson stuck to his story till the day he died. His family continues to corroborate it. Bob Gimlin is still alive and he sticks to the same account as well. They never changed their story and they actually produced evidence of their claim. That‚Äôs a lot more than I can say for the hoaxers who allege to be the subject of film to get their 15 minutes of fame.I believe you‚Äôre remembering Bob Heironimous‚Äô recreation. As far as the walk goes I‚Äôm personally unconvinced.You can say what you want about the P/G film but my favorite detail that makes me believe it‚Äôs real is you can see the quad on it‚Äôs right leg jiggle when it steps and the calf muscle flex.As someone who lives near Mount St. Helens I want to know about the Mount St Helens bodies- is this in reference to that early 1900s incident of a supposed attack by Bigfoot or am I missing something something even better?Two events happened at St helens in the 20's was the ape canyon attack where miners shot one and where attacked all night. The second one with the bodies is reference to lots of tales of how the government took a few bodies recovered right after the eruption.very interesting video i didn‚Äôt know jack about bigfoot before i guess.If you believe BF is a natural animal like an ape or relic hominid I ask you to explain the sightings in highly populated areas like New Jersey Ohio Massachusetts.  And why no good photos or videos other than the PG film? Why no bodies? Every other animal is killed by vehicular impacts but not BF. why do the footprints disappear into nothing? Why the strange lights and other poltergeist-like phenomena that are frequently associated with BF sightings? Why are they shot at so many times and don't die?\s\sIt's because they are paranormal entities and will never be caught or killed.  BF is a super magic entity that will always be beyond our understanding or dominion.That the fantasy world next to the real world. That where they cast wizard magics and go poof. \s\sWoof that the underside world of the round moonsun that is of the daily changes of mana.It‚Äôs cool that there is an active cryptic showing up around the Midwest currently. I hope some good footage pops up.I really appreciate the analysis you put into investigating this case featured here. The specifics you make sure to include especially geographically. The comparisons to other similar cases nearby recent or not but still with dates included. That was a great addition to the article Most publications who publish material on the paranormal are blatantly sensationalist BS. Most of them do not have the qualities of journalistic integrity that your publication/investigative service seem to possess inherently. I look forward to reading some of the other reports by you folks at SF. This is very good stuff.The Michigan Dogman?If  they actually exist why wouldn't they do so in more than one place?Isn't the Dogman like well-documented as being a fabrication? The guy who wrote the song about it admitted he made it up and there was zero info about it before the song was releasedYup ole Dogman!Cynocephaly. They have existed in our history books for thousands of years.I saw something similar in AZ on the 93N towards Nevada. It had the head of a kangaroo no tail big torso long arms short legs like a gorilla. It moved quickly across the highway like a gorilla would (using the knuckles of their fore limbs).That's exactly how it ran in that video where it apperently attacked the camera man.""He said it was 6-7 feet tall and was walking around on 2 legs. ""\s\sThis ruins the account for me. We are very used to seeing six-foot people. We very rarely see seven-foot humans and it's eyecatching when we do. Uncle Jerry's effectively saying ""I saw a bipedal creature. It was between perfectly-normal height and astonishingly tall.""6 ft is taller than average and 7 ft certainly is. \s\sWhen was the last time you saw a large upright walking canine?I‚Äôm kind of surprised it didn‚Äôt see him. Maybe Jerry was such an experienced hunter that he could move around quietly enough. The terror he felt sounds unnatural; something not like what comes from seeing a regular animal.That‚Äôs somebody sister bro !

How often do visitors have red hair?Can you imagine if the lore regarding leprechauns started from people in the past witnessing these aliens?Looked like Mysteryon to meRick and morty in and outs.Could you imagine if these aliens decided to show themselves as Rick and Morty in these encounters? I'd be way more terrified of that than the Greys. HahaWhy would they even ask him? What the fuck is he supposed to say?\s\sIf he says ""no"" they could probably just kill him extremely easily and no one would know.\s\sAnd how would he survive on ""their"" world? Who says the aliens are even carbon based life forms that require oxygen and water? They could be silicon based organisms that require liquid ammonia and hydrogen gas to survive. How would the aliens know exactly what life support system to give him?Good questions but I would just assume if they've advanced over millions of years and are smart enough to build physics defying technology that can traverse the universe at the speed of light they probably thought of all of that and have the answers to those questions already. Plus asking that is assuming they didn't create our species in the first place and know more about us than we do.\s\sPlease don't take this as combative as that seems to be the default assumption on social media these days. Especially reddit. You make good points.I feel like they know that there are enough of us that will accept the terms. Plus the rate of speed they travel it wouldnt be any where near 7 years in our time. Check the experiment NASA did by sending one twin in space for a year he came back slightly younger than his identical twin brother slightly taller as well. I cant remember the scientific term for when time slows down but it is a literal thing!I would hope these beings know enough about us already for that not to be a problem... And they may just believe that it's immoral to kill and threaten people.\s\sIdk I believe all these different alien encounters aren't what they present themselves as being. Almost like they're studying how we react to these encounters more than anything else. They're consistently surreal and lacking in logic - to the point it gets to be hard to believe that people are making them up ironically.Sorry I'm just imagining them opening up the spaceship back home and the guy immediately inhaling an ammonia atmosphere and dying and the aliens saying ""Who knew??""Carbon is far more versatile and carbon-based life would always outcompete silicon-based life and maybe it already has on Earth.  There might be a lot more parallel evolution out there than we think because of the way molecules come together and interact. Some aliens might have iron based blood or hair or feathers or chlorophyll; they may shit brown and pee yellow and get drunk on alcohol. Why? Molecular chemistry.Well they came from a different planet they are probably here often an probably ain't the first human they ""asked"" this for. But i do like the idea of a silicon based life form advanced enough for very advanced ways of traveling. Theirs a curve that it takes a species a tremendous amount of skill intelligence and luck to make it past this curve before we destroy ourselves to be a very advanced species with a fancy name i can't remember right noww. Maybe the aliens finding us perhaps helping us advance is the luck we need.Def ask them about some alien weed and alien pussy then we could advance the ConvoAsk them about alien dick too man some of us are bisexual üëÄ I want to know about all the options..work for us first...then become specimen yourself..suuure well get you back home later..we never said alive..I'll have an oz of whatever hes smokin please. But ye in all seriousness if it is true then things are so far beyond the general public's understanding that even with solid evidence you'd get laughed out of the room. You'd literally have to put the alien leader on tv announcing he'd arrived and half the world would still be convinced it was cgi. Social engineering has been such a success that i doubt anyone truly knows exactly what the fuck is going on. Generations upon generations of brainwashing and rewriting history combined with good old propaganda. The true weapons of the people that think of themselves as the rightful leaders of this spinning rockHave you heard of Iran's account trying to intercept UFOs?

From the Pleiades star cluster Eduard Albert Meier That predicted the Iraq War AIDS and global warming. \s\sThis is in 58. \s\sDuring the course of researching thousands of pages of information Meier claims the extraterrestrials provided Horn and other researchers have found over 250 examples of specific previously unknown scientific information that Meier published up to more than 60 years before ""official discovery"". Ironclad proof that Meier published the information first is established by internationally recognized copyrights.\s\sConveyed in the clear language of science and subsequently confirmed by NASA discoveries is information about every planet in the solar system as well as black holes the speed of gravity the impending threat posed by asteroid Apophis and terrestrial environmental seismic and volcanic events etc.\s\sIn his presentation Horn will also show Meier's pre-digital era UFO photos and films which were authenticated by independent photographic and special effects experts beginning in the late 1970s. In 2017 former top investigator-supervisor for the USAF Office of Special Investigations (OSI) Joe Tysk analyzed Meier's even earlier UFO evidence from 1964 and concluded that it was indisputably authentic.\s\sMars\s\sIn addition to providing the evidence to Prof. Loeb Horn also brought it to NASA-USGS scientist Ken Herkenhoff who specializes in Mars astrophotography. In a recent conversation Herkenhoff told Horn ""I should say that I have long hoped that we have or will be contacted by advanced civilizations and that we could learn from them and that the statistics of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy suggests that there are probably many advanced civilizations.""\s\sRegarding Meier's information about lightning on Mars Herkenhoff said ""I have not heard of any observations of lightning on Mars."" It's not widely known that NASA first observed lightning on Mars in 2009‚Ä¶22 years after Meier verifiably published it in 1987.

I didn't even know about the Lovelock Giants until years later when I found a mention of them on the internet. It was like reading another side to what my Grandpa told me.\s\sIf you look more into this you can find Nevada News print articles of the Lovelock Discovery online the last that was ever known of the remains was that they were sent off to the Smithsonian and the trail ends there.Yeah and it's kind of suspicious how the Smithsonian ""lost"" the remains right? I thought I watched something that made it seem odd that the Smithsonian of all places simply can't find evidence of it.I went to high school around that area of northern Nevada and have never heard of this; I'm gonna have to ask my rez friends if they know any stories. It's amazes me to ponder what we don't know.Its possible that they were a remnant of  Viking explorers......many many generations of inbreeding and isolation and this is the result. There is evidence that the Vikings did manage to get a really long way inland into the US continent by sailing up the river systems. But eventually they were devoured by the endless forest and couldn't find their way back. That seems like a real and logical possibility to me. Gigantism is a possible result of inbreeding within a very small gene pool....it would also explain the fair skin and red hair. That makes the most sense to me.Awesome storyThis is really fascinating stuff thank you for sharing.

[https://youtu.be/66MbXX3qDBE](https://youtu.be/66MbXX3qDBE)BONKI live a few hours from Lovelock but I'm only a few miles out of the paiute reservation.  The paiute legend says that there were giants with red hair that would prey on the paiute people and that the giants lived in caves and refused peace saying that they would attack and eat paiutes given the chance.  The  skeleton found in the cave was about 6' tall  and some bones recovered with it were from cows and it was mistakenly referred to as 'giant bones'. The mummified remains in the cave had fragments of reddish hair which is due to the hair oxidizing in the earth meaning the original color can't be determined. Some people think it was a tribe of Neanderthal or Neanderthal hybrids that survived extinction for a few thousand years  and due to their physical differences to the paiutes they were seen as monsters. Neanderthals were also known for violence against other tribes and occasional cannibalism during ceremonies and times of low resources. \s\sHere's an article on the science behind it\shttps://nevadagram.com/the-red-haired-giant-cannibals-of-the-lovelock-cave/That‚Äôs for the great write up!youre right about the canniblism thing i think i remember hearing about a skull being found bashed open supposedly used as a bowl/cupThe info is really interesting but the guy narrating is hard to follow.

Further when our flesh decomposes including the cartilage bits that keep us together our bones spread outward. Adding a few inches with every little bone can make us look super tall. This is where a lot of so-called giants get their origins from people not terribly familiar with anatomy. \s\sEspecially when NAGPRA is initiated due to obvious tribal concerns things are handled privately and respectfully making people believe there's some kind of government coverup. \s\s(There are also bones from other animals that regularly get confused for human bones and other things like that too.)That's just what a giant would say....Ben KisselIt's pronounced Py(pie)-YootNephilim?r/HomoGiganticusMy best guess here is that they were members of a culture that bound skulls and red hair is a genetic mutation so it‚Äôs possible that they all were of a single lineage. Maybe iron dyed the hair as well. The weird shaped skulls also lends credence to my theory that they are a family. They could all be suffering from a genetic disorder like Gigantism.These look just like the Paracas skulls.[https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/breaking-new-dna-testing-2000-year-old-elongated-paracas-skulls-changes-020914](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/breaking-new-dna-testing-2000-year-old-elongated-paracas-skulls-changes-020914)\-\s\sI don't think these are human.

Neither Bohm Swann or Targ were Theosophists nor has the concept of the Akashic records ever come up in any of the work that these men participated in. Swann was the man that originally coined the term ""Remote Viewing"" and ""Astral Projection.""\s\s>which he believed contained the key to understanding how the universe  unfolded from a kind of Universal Mind that pervades the entire cosmos  at all times.\s\sBohm took this idea from Carl Jung's theory of the Collective Unconscious.\s\sSwann went down the rabbit hole later in life and started making a bunch of weird claims about his time with the CIA. Romanticizing and probably just making shit up towards the end about Top Secret projects that never existed to begin with. The CIA dropped the programs because the statistics couldn't justify the financing for the projects. Even Swann's remote viewing only had a marginal success rate. He continued this work later on with Jacques Vallee without much success.\s\sListen to enough Coast to Coast AM radio over the course of your life and you'll hear all about Ingo Swann and Targ. Art Bell has a few shows with Swann from the archives that are worth a listen.Check out [Itzhak Bentov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzhak_Bentov). He work with the CIA on remote viewing and many other psychic experiments. Somehow he mysteriously died in a plane crash.

The section which describes the degrees and sex magic as well are also fucked up describing situations which don't take place. Sex is discussed as union - search alchemical marriage. Lon Milo DuQuette discusses the sex magic portion of the OTO as just that. As well his chosen map of terminology is far different from Crowley's chosen map of terminology which includes the marriage of Whore and Beast (Crowley) rather than knight and queen (DuQuette).\s\sMost of the article is either humorous to hide what the OTO really represents or is pretty humorously inaccurate. Sensational is right. No sex actually takes place unless behind closed doors between consenting adults outside of temple/lodge settings and probably having nothing to do with magic (leave this one behind closed doors). The idea of being naked in ritual can be more than an idea yes but is representative of truth more than anything else.

It was some crazy back and forth but I'm still a little bit embarrassed to be from the same country where a chunk of mainstream society still seems to think that baby snatching witch satan cults are real and want to burn Wiccans because somehow in England they haven't heard of them yet.Veganism tends to kill your libido so probably not the best place for a sex cult to meet regularly.They were all eating pork pies.Then why am I always horny?Got proof for that one buckaroo?How to prove you know nothing about veganism in just one sentence!Vegans mad AFLolSounds like the Gardnerians just finished circle...Someone somewhere in the internet: Vegan is devil backwards!!!!Daily failJust looks like some Goth edgelords lol they could have even been actors on lunch breakWhere are people finding these satanic sex cults I wanna join :(Did she join?

The kraken was released yesterday in Seattle. Just Google Seattle KrakenI read that as ‚Äúmythical Karen was real‚Äù like the ultimate Karen!Chuthulu Karen is realHeres my take.. In olden times we didnt have motors or propellers to make loud noises or create fast speeds. All we had were oval shaped boats with paddles sticking out the sides or.. just an oval shaped boat (to the eye of a squid or octopus).  So these animals are highly inquisitive and curious most likely they approached the ships touched all over them with their suckery sucker pads and tentacles.  Maybe it was checking to see if it was edible maybe it was checking to see what it was in general?   Maybe it wasnt even aggressive it just appeared aggressive because it was so unknown. A tentacle touching me would freak me out and a sucker pad full of hooks would probably get hung in your clothes and cause you to fall over board.  But these squid or octos dont do this anymore because the boats now have motors or are huge.

Putting a face and a name to the music would strip that away. Intentional or not the quest to learn the true identity of Mr. Fantastik is a direct reflection of why DOOM and his fanbase have such a strong connection: we always want to know more. DOOM is the master of always giving fans just enough to always look for answers. In a day and age when a guest 16 has a one-hour shelf life on social media DOOM has fans asking questions about a 2003 verse in 2019. Incredible.This is so true imagine we we had like 3 mediocre Mr. Fantastik albums/mixtapes those two verses would absolutely lose what makes them special. \s\sAlso most people just know the feature in ""Rap Snitch Knishes"" (Mm..FOOD) but I honestly think his feature in ""Anti Matter"" (Take me to your leader) is even better.Its probarbly just one of his friends that doesn't rap and he wrote the lyrics forHe first met him at an arms deal what else do you need to know?Dudes def New York.

Grottos have been popular features in gardens since at least the time of the Greek city-states so this site could‚Äôve been part of a wealthy person‚Äôs estate.I'm of the opinion that this is two separate things. The shell part? 1700's or most likely even 1830 right before it opened to the public. That part is ""new."" They say the shells are discolored from gas lamps. Well how would they have lit the area before then? Would fire lighting not cause some extent of damage? Therefore the shells are newish. The cavern system? Old. Old as balls. Don't know how old. The website doesn't want to go into the area's history likely owners church records geological records or whatever else there is. What about that ground penetrating radar that they use to find old wood or stone circles or lost archeological sites in the jungle? Use some of that on the area. Or they just know the actual answer because the ""mystery"" hype on their website feels a little suspect. WhO could It bE? The 12 year old kid found it sure uh huh ok. Respect to them for maintaining this place and it is a cool question though. I just think someone knows more than they are letting on and a proper survey could answer a lot of questions.They address that idea on the site.\s\s- The land the Grotto lies under was farmland and as far as we know has never formed part of a large estate. So why would a rich man‚Äôs fancy be built under someone else‚Äôs pastureland?\s‚Äã\s- Follies were built as a statement: look at how much money I have look at how cultured I am look at me! So if they included shells the more exotic the better. In general they weren‚Äôt secret hidden away places.\s‚Äã\s- If the Grotto had been built in the 1700s is it possible that all knowledge of it had disappeared by the time of its discovery in 1835? The building of the Grotto would have been a mammoth task: the excavation of the passageways transporting 4.6 million shells to the site sorting those shells and enlisting enough labour to create the mosaic. How to do all this on rising open ground next to a busy track without anyone noticing? lolHonestly the nature of the symbols and designs they described make it sound as if it could have been a pagan site to worship in secret if this place turns out to be much older than the 1700s.I wonder if it is an example of 'outsider art' & specifically a 'fantasy world' (also visionary environment)?  So a person who had access to the land & was driven by a naive but powerful artistic vision created the site for their own internal needs then passed away & it was forgotten until found later. I suspect it is not very old personally so maybe constructed within a 100 years of its later discovery.\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art\s\s(""In many cases their work is discovered only after their deaths."" from above link)\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visionary_environment\s\sCheck out https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval as an example of how this might be relevant.\s\sPeople who are interested in this sub may be interested in lots of material in those links.I used to go there when I was a kid!

The epic indicates where their planet originally was which is somewhere near the horse head nebula and within the orion nebula or possibly flame nebula.  The account indicates of a growing fierce giant that's red and crimson in coloring that has the blood of other planets on her hands.  Then she's defeated this is a super nova event which is why she has the blood of other planets and stars on her hands...This is not a mythical story this is the ancient past trying to communicate with us.  I believe it's  possible these cuneiform tablets are from the survivors themselves and this was their way to show us where they/we came from.  The answer is orions belt and this is why we see huge tributes around the world like egypt.  These are not tributes at all  they are sign visible from space like a flare for any other survivors. Hence the nazca lines messages to possible other survivors.

Two US harbour patrolmen Harold A. Dahl and Fred L. Crisman had spotted a UFO over the water of Puget Sound Washington. Dahl said that a man dressed in black visited him shortly after the sighting and forcefully advised him not to discuss the incident further. A similar meeting happened to Carlo Rossi from the area near San Pietro a Vico in Italy. In the early hours of 25th July 1952 Rossi was fishing in the River Serchio when he witnessed a strange circular craft hovering over the river. Rossi hid watching the craft as it passed over him and then sped away. In the following weeks he told no-one about what he had seen but on 15th September he found a stranger dressed in a dark blue suit waiting for him by the river. The stranger spoke Italian but with an odd Scandinavian accent and had very strange facial features.Smith's men in black and Kevin Spacey but the 1st 2 are actually ironically funny.\s\s.bruh this shit is retardedIf you say so ""Geoffery"" üòÇHaha this is brilliant better than most modern day comedy‚Äôs I love it thanksBut we know the people who made the crop circles with ropes and planks.Fake afStop spamming it in every sub possible.

One of the most fascinating ideas brought forward from ancient times is the concept of a hidden world existing underneath the surface of the Earth. Agartha (also referred to as Agharti Agartta or Agarttha) is arguably the most popular version of this type of legend being mentioned in one form or another by several different ancient societies throughout history.  There are a plethora of oral traditions and popular legends found throughout several countries detailing the existence of an underground civilization of beings who possess supernatural intelligence and significant spiritual power. These subterranean people are commonly believed to be the inhabitants of Agartha.

In all her cases she never discovered a negative experience where someone who encountered aliens or were abducted. She said the human minds strongest emotion is fear so when she worked with her clients she would put them in a trance that put their state of conscious out of the picture so we could get past the fear or that blocks the process. Cool stuff!Dont buy sex with aliens or hybrid etc... abduction victims have similar stories yes but I would guess this is more of an MK ultra type situation ..prepping/ creating a false alien invasion narrative Among the many harrowing tales of alien abduction there are scores of cases where abductees have reported interacting with alien hybrids. According to the various testimonies of these victims they have personally encountered creatures that shared both human and alien features and characteristics.Any time I see an abduction victim talking about having sex with aliens I know they are lying through their teeth.

Care to summarize ? In 1924 archaeologists found the remains of red-haired giants the Si-Te-Cah of Piaute folklore in Lovelock Cave Nevada. Is this fact fiction or legend?  Lovelock Cave in Nevada was first discovered in 1913 when prospectors found a huge deposit of bat guano in this cave. Since guano is the basis for saltpeter the main ingredient in gunpowder the value of the find was obvious.‚ÄúAccording to Paiute oral history the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants. Mummified remains of a man ""six feet six inches tall"" were discovered by guano miners in Lovelock Cave in 1911.[4]:168 Adrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book Fossil Legends of the First Americans.[12] She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However about 100 miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature soil etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red.‚Äù"

The Pentagon seems to have had carte blanche exclusive access to all UAP information at least in the U.S. - and now that others that have equipment that can possibly detect and reveal more than the Pentagon wants to reveal and are showing interesting in studying the phenomena they need to take measures to keep the lid on their secrets.\s\sPerhaps because they still think this should be information only the military should have access to... or perhaps their lies of decades gone by will be exposed.

Doesn't hurt to get a FOIA I suppose.I believe he said he was briefed on it when he was part of the intelligence community and he talked to the Navy pilots. Which could've been last year. I don't know what his previous job was and i think he joined NASA this year right?Yes: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/10/nasa-bill-nelson-q-a-493288So Bill Nelson's decision to look into the UFOs wasn't a sudden impulse it was already underway.Kind of both and neither.\s\sThat recent interview where he says he was briefed about the topic he definitely implies to have been briefed very recently. After the report dropped I assume all depts involved were on high alert and NASA being famously involved with the public probably felt now is as good as ever to brief the public with our [most recent developments as well](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-space/2021/06/11/bill-nelsons-nasa-agenda-493209)\s\s'*A couple of years ago as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee I was briefed on what those Navy pilots saw and I have talked to the Navy pilots‚Äù Nelson recalled. ‚ÄúThey are quite convinced.

What is so top secret about a desolate planet?Part of it is because bandwidth between Earth and Mars isn't very good and often reserved for other often critical mission objectives. Another part is how much power the rover and drone can expend before having to recharge it's reserved mostly for the missions as well and life support.It is millions of miles to Mars.

Let‚Äôs just discount the years of disclosure from people with government credentials that tells us these programs have been going on since WW2. We‚Äôll never get the truth from our government because it isn‚Äôt ours anymore. They‚Äôve proved that over and over that they don‚Äôt answer to us the people.This is a different world. That report has just said this UFO stuff is real.\s\sThe USG is attempting to ascertain intent but can't. The USG admits something is occurring in our national security space in a way where pilots and people looking can't figure out what it is they are looking at and therefore cannot ascertain what it wants.\s\sPerhaps we should go back to calling them UFO? Given that it seems most of the P in Phenomenon are O as in Objects. But I digress the USG admits and acknowledges these are real-world phenomena.\s\sThis is now a conversation of is this us as in of human construction on this planet or not? Is it a foreign adversary that has developed technology so radical and leapfrog us in such a way that we have no idea the intent of that device? I find it humorous that the best idea the Russians or Chinese can come up with to use this technology is to buzz our fighters. Come on... Think more along the lines of first strike via uninhibited placement of tactical nuclear weapons via a single Tic-Tac?\s\sThis report is saying:\s\s1. These are real.\s2. We don't know what they are.\s3. If this is a foreign adversary we've been technologically triple-leapfrogged.\s4. Clearly this could pose a threat to national security. But is this true if it is a foreign actor but not of this planet? This document says we don't know and need more data.\s\sThe report specifically addresses the stigmatization of reporting UAP sightings in the military. Moreover it states that socio-cultural stigmas are real and debilitating. Professionals REALLY don't want to be laughed at or ridiculed or potentially lose their job.\s\sThis report is saying that we need real data and describes a ""giggle-factor"" that is hampering the ability to get that information. I'm looking directly at you NDT. Sam Harris literally tried to warn you.\s\sThe scientific community has been absent on this issue. They have betrayed not this country but you could say on some level this planet. Science as an institution has utterly failed on this issue. The point the report is making is this is hampering the ability to do real science because scientists are behaving in this dogmatic way and not actually doing the observation.\s\sDespite the resentment towards science it's worth making a point that you are still needed to help bring the public to awareness. You can't have a document like this and the world go on as normal. We need more information.\s\sDisclaimer and warning: This is currently being heavily framed in terms of national security. It would be appreciated if the scientists could get their heads out of their asses and start providing their take on this evolving situation. Start doing their own experimentation and petitioning the USG for what it knows.More like wont be explainedthis photo if real makes me wonder if it's American tech. it looks like a test device like everything you need to make it fly but it just doesn't have the polished outer finish.Hard to tell from one pic.Let's just desensationalise this a bit shall we.\s\s**SOME** of these ""UFO"" incidences remain unexplained.\s\sWhich in of itself is amazing but don't phrase it like every graining picture of a frisbee is now somehow legitimized.If you want to desensationalise it further Blue Book stated some of its cases were unidentified too and that was 70 years ago.

Extremely credible witnesses especially the pilot.  I want to know more about the thrusters he observed what they looked like etc.  first time I‚Äôve heard of craft operating in that way.

FAA Division Chief Callahan gives an illuminating interview here: https://youtu.be/HUak1jfA2HgGood article.

Example video from 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6QL0VjqYgI&t=0sHmmmIf anyone is interested in my UFO sighting I posted it here. It was before drones were readily available to the public it definitely wasn‚Äôt a Chinese Lantern it occurred during a snowstorm and I have confirmation it wasn‚Äôt a civilian aircraft - my dad was a helicopter pilot at the time and he told me the nearest base/airport  was closed due to the intense snowstorm.\s\sI saw a blinking orange/red dot in the sky that was sort of bobbing up and down. It was blinking because the snow would disrupt the light so as it got closer it wasn‚Äôt blinking but definitely had some variation. It looks like a big ball of fire.\s\sIt was a sphere of energy/plasma and I estimate it was anywhere from 6-10 ft in diameter. When I stopped my vehicle to look at it it also stopped and hovered above the trees seeming to acknowledge me (but who knows). \s\sAnyway so I wrote this report 11/24/2010 it was before cellphones had cameras that were any good. \s\shttp://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79047.html\s\sUpon researching my area I also noticed others has similar sightings to mine.Tictac is your Apple design influence on uap perception.iTacNah would have a dongle hanging off of itUfos have been described as wheels shields chariots pillars etc and it's literally just a contextual description based on what the observers knew as similarities/references of the time. To speculate that there's technology that alters a person's perception is quite a leap especially once you take into consideration multiple/mass ufo sightings where individuals all report to see the same thing. If the technology/method that's described in this video exists surely people would have conflicting descriptions/accounts when it came to ufo observations/experiences?  \s\s\sWhen have you ever heard a credible ufo report where person A said a UFO was round and person B claimed it to be square? Plus how does a seamless tictac with two rod/antenna protruding from it; which bounces around ""like a pingpong ball"" help anyone's brain understand what they're seeing? Also why? Why have a technology that does this? And why have a technology that appears to evolve alongside man's technological evolution? I can understand a wheel a shield and a chariot...why does it then become more complex so complex I'm no longer able to understand what I'm observing?I responded below as well but I think your questions can actually be answered pretty well through quantum physics. At the most basic level - quantum physics would allow for something to be 'really present' in two places at once/ non-binary - potentially something we would perceive as 'a pingpong ball' motion; because our brains biologically create our reality in a binary way (ie. each neuron is either receiving/ transmitting electrical signal(s) or not 1 or 0) we may not be able to effectively process what we are seeing if the info is both 1 and 0 or 0 and 0 or 1 and 1 at the same time.I do think incidents like the Ariel School where the children mostly reported perceiving the same rough shape but had different reported perceptions about the aliens looks/ actions of aliens/ sizes of aliens/ hair...etc. is an example of the way many people could experience 'the same' thing and have disparate memories.I mean anything's possible? \s\shttps://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a36329671/is-the-universe-conscious/\s\shttps://newatlas.com/physics/charm-meson-particle-matter-antimatter/I agree. This line of reasoning is so damn lazy. In fact it so encapsulates conspiratorial thinking that whoever puts forth this theory should be embarrassed. It's a classic example of connecting any and every dot whether it makes sense to or not.\s\s""Hmm strange phenomenon happening here. I know! It's all connected it's all the same thing! You see?! Don't you!? We are all one and we create our own reality through the sheer fact that we are conscious beings!""\s\sAny theory that has ""we create our own reality"" at its core is total buffoonery.Yo a thought just occurred to me what if there aren‚Äôt any reports of sound because sound is somehow too messy to project? \s\sBut this kinda falls apart since it can‚Äôt be proven but here it is anyways \s\sWhat if these things are able to induce false signals in networks of any kind? Create a visual illusion or an illusion in sensor system that results on everyone agreeing to see the same phenomenon. That works just fine for things that we see. The problem with sound is that it can‚Äôt be reduced to some change in a network it‚Äôs literally the uniform vibration of trillions upon trillions of particles in 3D space. But we can accomplish that vibration by the use of any object. The problem with this projection thing is that it isn‚Äôt there and thus can‚Äôt have that complex effect on reality. \s\sIt can make any network feel see or hear something that isn‚Äôt there. But can‚Äôt affect matter even in the most rudimentary way. \s\sAnd this is assuming that the complexity of the network doesn‚Äôt matter. A 20 million dollar FLIR system is treated the same as an analog thermometer \s\sThis probably applies to light too equally untestable but it probably doesn‚Äôt emit IR light to physically heat anything either. Or any sort of real interaction with any set of particles. \s\sMaybe we can trick it. Shove an ungodly amount of sensors at it to prove that there physically isn‚Äôt anything there by somehow overloading it.\s\sBut this is most definitely just a ham fisted way to explain away the weird lack of sound from case to case. Maybe the lack of sound just sounds futuristicThere's a book by Patrick F. Galouye called The Dark Universe. I don't want to give away too much because it's actually a very cool book and I recommend it to anyone.. but the gist of it is there is a group of isolated people living underground who have not seen light in a generation or two.\s\sThey have lived in perfect darkness. One group developed pretty sophisticated echo location and another some sort of infrared. The people with sonar see light for the first time and just cannot wrap their heads around it. ""Silent sound"" they call it.  \s\s\sI'm open to the idea that what we consider the physical world is actually psycho-physical.\s\sWe could be a tribe of people who have developed this sort of physicalism as our way of deciphering reality.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø\s\sDon't knowOh man.. Or what if this is the prison reality but now they need people who can expertly navigate 'this' band of the electromagnetic spectrum bc troubles in the wider spectrum. Starring Vin diesel.Thank you. I had read that book as a teenager and had totally forgotten about it.This video postulates that there is a mass hallucination taking place. This makes no sense. This means that something is causing the navy sensors to somehow be affected. I guess if whatever is causing the mass hallucination it is powerful enough to make our minds hallucinate but also the navy sensors? I find that hard to believe and to me that makes it much more believable that it is actual aliens that people are seeing.I think the phenomenona materializes into this dimension which is why it gets picked up by radar sometimeswe would see tits food and money if it's mass hallucinationCheck out my response above. I think a mass hallucination implies a sense of delusion but is actually closely linked to the biology of our brain. While it's not a perfect answer and I take your point regarding the navy sensors the sensors themselves are built outside of/ below quantum perceptions and the sensor data has to be interpreted in a way that our mind can perceive what is happening. The example within the TED talk when he shows how google AI creates an interpretation is related - watch from about 7:00-8:30.[deleted][deleted]When I was younger I had this thought that consciousness lives on after death but separated from all life and anyone else in eternal darkness.So what does fit the mind of a camera?good watchThis channel is a gold mine. She also links the source documents in the description.\s\sShe‚Äôs working on a documentary so they are on a hiatus but it will be well worth it.What if we live in a simulation and all ufos/paranormal occurrences are just outside equivalent of 4chan trolling us?Source Documents: https://itsredacted.com/the-most-unsettling-u-f-o-theory/This seems like such a bullshit theory.  \s\sWe have infrared alert systems that respond to these things?\s\sAre they influencing our minds and then being sure to also go in and edit magnetic thermal and satellite imagery captured by devices potentially hundreds of miles away in real time?It's easy to rule what's suggested in this episode out when you are looking for ""serious proof"". By cherry-picking your data you throw out all the cases where someone saw bigfoot near to a UFO independent sightings of weird creatures (as in ""not my bailiwick im after aliens & tech"") etc. When you see the larger context it becomes clear that there is a connection between most of these strange types of encounters. You are free to still conclude they are all imaginary but with more vigor. Or you conclude the other way too that a lot of this stuff is eerily related.\s\sIf you found this video interesting do not pass go: read Passport to Magonia. Even if you disagree with it Vall√©e presents much more detail to this theory which is very damn interesting. If you have seen and read hundreds of UFO witness cases you can immediately see that there is something to this once you see what Vall√©e is talking about here. \s\sAlso note that the 2nd half of this book is all UFO reports in chronological order starting with north american air ship sightings around 1897.‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt tic tacs‚ÄùTLDR?Man.\s\sI won‚Äôt do it justice but I‚Äôll try.\s\sThis phenomenona plays off our consciousness and what we as a collective expect a ufo to look like or something like that. \s\sThroughout the years this phenomenona has changed shape the video goes through how in the past people saw cones and fighters with shields. \s\sThen we saw saucers and now tic tacs. Basically our mind is trying to make sense of what we are seeing so we basically see what we want to. It derives off of Jacques Vallee theory. Here‚Äôs a link to his [ama](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3url1s/i_am_dr_jacques_vall%C3%A9e_a_computer_scientist_and/)Nah. The most unsettling ‚Äútheory‚Äù would be the demons/fallen angels. That‚Äôs why they never discuss it. They‚Äôd lose their entire grip on your reality people would turn to God and their plan for a one world government/NWO would be shot. But‚Ä¶no. People would rather believe whatever their tv says and believe in aLiEnS.They're fallen angels abducting people so they can use us for reproduction. That's the most unsettling conclusion for me.\s\sI hope I'm wrong. Been studying UFOs for almost 27 years since I saw one hovering over a house. It would explain everything.\s\s- Why they don't communicate\s- Why they hide\s- Why our laws of physics don't apply to them\s- Why human looking people reported aboard UFOs\s- Why they talk about God\s- Why abductions happen\s- Why their technology is so far ahead\s\sGenesis 6 describes it happening before.That we‚Äôre a harvest and them watching us is basically tending the stock..tldw; a few weeks ago Tim McMillan told Steven Greenstreet something that was pretty significant: an intelligence/aerospace source alluded to UFOs not being flying saucers or tic tacs but ‚Äúsomething that possessed the ability to make your mind see what makes sense to you.‚Äù\s\sIn isolation this is just one comment.

Maybe he had them on his page because they were choosing which ones would be visible on the show.So uh the possibility that 1) their technology also changes over time or 2) they may have multiple types of craft or 3) there may simply be different ETs visiting us at different times... has never occurred to these folks?That too. As well as our minds not being able to make sense of what it is so we are projecting.So what Are they imitating Apple AirPods now?Anyone interested in considering what this may represent should look up Donald Hoffman on Youtube. As our interface evolves so our icons for whatever these craft actually represent in objective reality (the realm of conscious agents) does too.Vallee also says it is a technology. Hence the materials he has been parading around for years.This is a bad theory because its basically unfalsifiable. Every observation you make of any object conforms to the theory.\s\sYou see a stick falling? Its a UFO making itself look like a stick.\s\sYou see an airplane? Its a UFO making itself look like an airplane.\s\sYou see a saucer? Its a UFO making itself look like a saucer.\s\sHow do we distinguish between an entity that takes a form based on our psychology and a set of distinctly shaped entities? You cant.\s\sA theory that automatically conforms to every observation is a sign of poor Epistemology. \s\sFurthermore the fact that UFO shapes change over time to reflect the designs and fashions of the time is evidence that pareidolia is the primary cause of most of these sightings. \s\sFlying saucers from the 1950s have a distinctive 1950s look. This is evidence for the null hypothesis not evidence for the reality of UFOsIt really does come across as a hand-waving explain for why they don't have any substantial evidence of E.T.s or to brush over the clearly contradictory positions of ""experts"" when they want to believe both. \s\sIt's borderline of ""well if there was a successful conspiracy to keep it all secret then there would be absolutely no evidence of a conspiracy. There is no evidence of a conspiracy so conspiracy confirmed!""The very first flying saucer report that kicked off the trend was a misunderstanding! The actual craft were described as flying wings their movement was described as that of skipping saucers. This got reported as flying saucers and suddenly thats what everyone is seeing.It's not a theory to prove ufo's are real but rather explain what may be going on. I'm pretty sure the TTSA are all in on them already proven.\s\sAs a theory is it testable? Yes but with time and collecting samples. Does this mean it is testable?Or maybe like humans do with automobiles aliens are constantly changing their ship designs due to years of engineering.If anyone has read the book ‚ÄòSupernatural‚Äô by Graham Hancock they‚Äôd see the same ideas that are presented here.\s\sIn that book he posits that the phenomena of Shamanic initiations with chimeric gods seen in cave paintings accounts of fairies & elves alien abductions angelic apparitions and DMT/Ayahuasca entities are all accounts of the same phenomena of contact with inter-dimensional intelligence.\s\sThe book is wild. Even wilder than the rest of his body of work. I really struggled with it when I read it but I have to admit that it‚Äôs only seeming more prescient as whatever we are collectively going through right now continues to unfold.I cant roll my eyes any harder\s\snot against that channel btw.  I actually really like it.  but man some of this stuff is just woowoo.I actually see this as the exact opposite of woooo. If you read Jacques Vallee you‚Äôll start to see what I mean. He‚Äôs as serious a scientist and intelligent as they come imo. It‚Äôs about perception and subjectivity. When primitive tribes saw airplanes for the first time they thought they were birds. When you see something unexplainable and outside of your scope of experience your mind tries to identify it as best it can based on your subjectivity level. It makes sense that this could be happening to people who are looking at something that our minds can‚Äôt make sense of. It‚Äôs a pretty simple concept.Ur wowThe AATIP slides about psychological effects aren't necessarily about the morphing theory. They could just as well be about telepathy and people sometimes feeling overwhelming urges relating to UFOs. In many cases eyewitnesses describe getting telepathic messages from the UFO and being able to control it by simply wishing it would do something. This ability is a key point relating to national security.\s\sThe senior intelligence official's comments about a craft with an occupant crashing at Roswell are at odds with him also saying the phenomenon changes to reflect our ideas and concepts. Is the crashed craft they have at a warehouse somewhere constantly shape-shifting over time? The whole morphing theory is based on the objects NOT being real metallic saucers from other planets but some sort of mental projection based on a physical trigger. Which is the opposite of what the Roswell crash supposedly was a real reverse-engineerable metallic saucer with a biological pilot inside. You can't really claim both at once.They‚Äôre metaphysical manifestations of demonic entrances into the Geist obviously.We jest but that's the sort of thing the TTSA guys keep vaguely pointing towards as being their overall theory of UAP.  They seem to be trying to reconcile Ufology with the Skinwalker shit.  It's dumb and really unfortunate they've created a nice little monopoly for themselves on the whole UFO narrative./s\s\sStay erect and out of serious discussions.[deleted]I think we are often so focus on the observation and trying to find an explanation for these things that we actually don't pay attention to the psychology of the observer. At best we label the observer as credible or   a conman but we never really ask: how has a persons unconscious participated in a specific observation or claim. How did it try to make sense of  an indescribable phenomenon.\s\sI think there is definately a link that makes that the same phenomenon can appear in different ways and invoke totally different experiences ranging from fearful to almost blissful.\s\sIn one of his last books Carl C Jung looked at the ufo phenomenon and he theorized that in a world thats now ever more fragmented the circular aspect of a flying saucer was a symbolic shape signifying mans subconscious longing for wholeness amidst the tensions brought on by a world-disrupting cold war and the nuclear threat.\s\sSince the 50 ies we see less and less saucers but more and more triangular or TicTac shaped objects. The ufo symbolism changes with time it seemsHey here's a thought; what if it was both things? What if there are transdimensional and extraterrestrial intelligences visiting Earth at the same time? And...what if they both knew they were here?\s\sI'm playing devil's advocate here a bit. I'm certainly a proponant of Jacques Vall√©e's theories (which is a somewhat unifying theory of UAPs) but it might not be the only explanation.Some of us have known about this technology for years. It‚Äôs called a chameleon circuit. These crafts typically use them to hide in plain sight but the circuits are known to be a bit unreliable.It is odd how often you see a blue police box around london and cardiff these days.*The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man has entered the chatroom.Then why did we see white ball UFOs in 1952? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsHlFeC5vic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsHlFeC5vic)  \s\sModern times (just one example of many): \s\s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfjz7PknBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfjz7PknBQ)This has to be the most ridiculous thing I have heard.\s\sWe canr explain.why everyone's ufos are.different so let's just explain it by saying the morph. LolIt truly is retarded and over complicating things. Simply because it's more entertaining.Cool story bro.\s\sNo but for reals I would have to disagree. \s\sI've had several sightings alone as well as with groups of friends of various sizes.\s\sIf this theory held any water then my friends and I would have all seen our own personal versions of these things rather than the same lights shapes hues and movements.\s\sFor example: my friend his girlfriend and I all would have seen something different but my phone has no imagination. It is merely a light sensor picking up light so in [this video](https://youtu.be/KxF5SOUcnnA) who's ""imagined version"" of a UFO are we seeing? Mine? My friends? Or my phones?Maybe. But lights shapes and hues are open to interpretation. We can‚Äôt know that the red I see is the same as the red you see. But if you had seen a large object up close with a group of friends and you could all draw it in detail it might look very differently based on your level subjectivity (past experience life experience etc.) 4 friends and I saw something up close back in 97 and although I am completely certain that I saw 5 huge black triangle ships with lights on the corners etc when I talked to all of them recently each one of them remember seeing something mind blowing and other worldly but their description was no where near mine not even in the same ballpark. Besides that we all experienced the same thing at the same time but what it looked like to each of us was very different. If it had been a point of light or something without exact details it would be hard to know if what we saw was similar. But in this case what I saw was very detailed. And my friends apparently saw different details. This theory is one explanation of why we all saw different things. So it makes sense to me as a possibility. Either way cool stuff.So the observer predicts the outcome just like in the slit experiment? An effect of quantum physics?Do they change or does our perception of them change?Oh shit they're time lords?What if they were just bots sent out by the simulation. Like Smith Agents in the matrixNaah thats not itOnce again we're going with what's more entertaining to our imaginations and over complicating things.Posted on another sub with this vid but:\s\sI would be careful about Valle for a couple reasons:\s\s1. We know of sightings historically that are similar to sightings today. IE Neuremberg Aerial Phenomenon ~1560AD\s\s2. The fundamental principle behind his theory is intense paranoia and the belief that UFO's aren't real\s3. He worked for the CIA while developing these theories\s\s4. Inconsistent beliefs surrounding remote viewing sometimes treated as pure deception sometimes extremely active and supportive of the community\s\s5. Unlike virtually every ET researcher there is not a single critique of him from the scientific community that I can find. Screams ""hey trust this guy!"" \s\s6. It seems relatively obvious that world governments have been working to cover up UFO information for decades. Mirage Men Unacknowledged Black Programs redacted or incomplete FOIA requests (ie bluebook NASA sections) etc\s\s7. The ""government"" information here is not coming from a verifiable source and could easily be fake or pure disinformationYou should read some of his books because all of those points you made make you look silly and like someone who doesn‚Äôt know squat about Vallee.This would immediately destroy all\sstories of crashes retrieved parts (at least bigger ones) captured beings and reverse engineering. It would also make some hallucination inducing atmospheric/environmental effect much more likely than anything else. It is way more probable that the whole thing is experienced as real but that this experience is entirely made up in our minds. Then you have two possibilities - some sort of control mechanism as suggested in the video or a reoccurring psychological effect. Well I go with a malfunction of the human brain in this case.And dr. Davis saying we have recovered off world vehicles?I guess the question is to what degree are they able to manipulate physical matter? It seems that existing outside of time is a possibility which could limit the effect they have over this dimension. But if they can manipulate matter at the molecular level a la nanotech then purported crashes could certaily still be a thing. Bottom line is that this theory creates a cascading set of additional questions. The but the question of *how* they manipulate our 'reality'  is the key one for me. Is it physical is it psychological is it temporal?Lol wutI'm confused what does this have to do with UFOs?Meh. It's probably more relevant to paranormal subreddits. It's loosely relevant to UFOs and part of the article seems to be trying to rule out the UFO hypothesis. From the article:\s\s>In 1990 the prosecutor Ivanov who had retired published an article in which he claimed that while compiling his 1959 report he‚Äôd been pressured not to include his views on what happened. The article titled ‚ÄúThe Enigma of the Fireballs‚Äù said that the skiers had been killed by heat rays or balls of fire associated with U.F.O.s. In his original examination of the scene Ivanov had found trees with unusual burn marks which ‚Äúconfirmed that some kind of heat ray say or a powerful force whose nature is completely unknown (to us at least) acted selectively on specific objects‚Äù‚Äîin this case people. The last photograph in Krivonishchenko‚Äôs camera showed flares and streaks of light against a black background.Hi confused I'm Dad! :)Sightings involving ufos that night in this area and potential radioactivity on the site.Hi confused nice to meet you I am also dad.\s\sActually some us ""researchers"" theorized that there might have been UFOs involved as some people of the local Mansi tribe saw ""strange lights"" in the area around the time the incident happened.Text as it's behind a paywall for some:\s\s>The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has probably written close to 2000 columns since coming to The Washington Post. Among those that generated a steady stream of responses was one from 2019 headlined ‚ÄúUFOs exist and everyone needs to adjust to that fact.‚Äù That column did not say that aliens have visited Earth. Among the things it did say was that there literally are objects flying around that no one including U.S. Navy pilots can identify and we have to puzzle out what that means.\s\s>In the two years since that column appeared the U.S. government continues to tiptoe toward the normalization of the idea of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Last year the Department of Defense released three videos (one recorded in 2004 and the other two in 2015) of U.S. Navy pilots seeing something and having no idea what it was. In its news release the Pentagon said ‚Äúthe aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as ‚Äòunidentified‚Äô‚Äù putting the U in UFO.\s\s>The Pentagon went further in August 2020 announcing the establishment of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force. Beyond developing a new abbreviation that is less loaded than UFO the Pentagon explained ‚ÄúThe mission of the task force is to detect analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.‚Äù\s\s>Then 10 days ago former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe went on Fox News and made a whole bunch of claims about what the U.S. intelligence community knew about UAPs including that a Pentagon report would soon be released revealing even more information. According to the New York Post‚Äôs Tamar Lapin and Jackie Salo:\s\s>    ‚ÄúThere are a lot more sightings than have been made public‚Äù he told host Maria Bartiromo. ‚ÄúSome of those have been declassified.‚Äù\s\s>    ‚ÄúAnd when we talk about sightings‚Äù Ratcliffe continued ‚Äúwe are talking about objects that have been seen by Navy or Air Force pilots or have been picked up by satellite imagery that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain.‚Äù\s\s>    ‚ÄúMovements that are hard to replicate that we don‚Äôt have the technology for. Or traveling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom.‚Äù\s\s>Still it would appear that in June there will be an official U.S. government report acknowledging the existence of UFOs or UAPs or whatever you want to call them.\s\s>It is increasingly respectable to acknowledge that unidentified aerial phenomena are a thing. But this leads to a few follow-up questions. Does this evidence point toward the prospect of extraterrestrial observation of our planet? If so how should we feel about that?\s\s>I am not going to speculate on the first question beyond noting that if Harvard astrophysicists are making that suggestion about interstellar phenomena perhaps we need at least to consider the possibility that these UAPs might also be extraterrestrial in origin.\s\s>The more interesting question is how we should respond to this. There has been increasing apprehension on the part of some very smart people about contacting extraterrestrials. In 2010 Stephen Hawking told the Discovery Channel ‚ÄúIf aliens visit us the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America which didn‚Äôt turn out well for the Native Americans.‚Äù Similarly physicist Mark Buchanan argued in 2016 ‚ÄúAny civilization detecting our presence is likely to be technologically very advanced and may not be disposed to treat us nicely. At the very least the idea seems morally questionable.‚Äù\s\s>If UAPs are extraterrestrials however this is a different scenario: It is not humans contacting extraterrestrials but rather those extraterrestrials actively observing us. Furthermore they seem to be doing so in a way that is not destructive.\s\s>That is promising! Observation without the intent to destroy suggests a civilization that is much less violent than say Spanish conquistadors.\s\s>Furthermore it might be better for U.S. national security if these UAPs turn out to be ETs. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told the New York Post ‚ÄúFrankly that if it‚Äôs something from outside this planet ‚Äî that might actually be better than the fact that we‚Äôve seen some technological leap on behalf of the Chinese or the Russians or some other adversary that allows them to conduct this activity.‚Äù\s\s>I get the concern from physicists that technologically advanced extraterrestrials might behave as powerful human civilizations have in the past. But maybe the concerned physicists should engage a little more with social scientists. The assumption is that powerful technologically advanced civilizations will act in a destructive manner. That is possible but perhaps civilizations that reward destructive entrepreneurship are less likely to generate the technological wherewithal for interstellar travel. And if those UAPs are ETs maybe there is more hope for interstellar relations than either scientists or science fiction envision.\s\sEdit: Thanks for the gold kind human.\s\sEdit numero dos: Thanks for the *To The Stars* award fellow redditor. Imagine if UAP had the same enthusiasm as GME.You the real MVP and this should be top post. \s\sAlso I don't know about everyone else but I can usually get around the paywall if I right-click the link and open it in incognito mode.Thanks for posting the article!\s\sThese mainstream articles are fun to read they‚Äôre so careful about what they say and come across as so naive it‚Äôs almost cute.  \s\sOnce you‚Äôve listened to dozens of hours-long interviews of retired military personnel read up on all of the major incidents reviewed all of the pilot sighting reports listened to abductee interviews read countless books on the topic... you get such a more interesting complex and compelling story. It‚Äôs not 100% true of course. But it‚Äôs so much more than ‚Äòthese might be ET!‚Äô \s\sThose  who still claim we lack evidence for ET are simply unwilling to ‚Äòeven entertain‚Äô evidence that doesn‚Äôt come from mainstream sources. You don‚Äôt have to believe it to read it. But those who dive in with a scientific mindset most often become believers and advocates for our ET companions.Thanks!\s\sI never understood how anyone could state that the most likely explanation for UAP are either secret US Chinese or Russian military projects. The observed and documented flight characteristics far surpass our most advanced planes (rockets fly fast but they can't hover obviously). These objects have been observed for a long time too.\s\sSo to me it is incomprehensible to assume that the ET hypothesis is STILL the must unlikely. Given what is known it is the MOST likely.Do you think its scientific to extrapolate our barbaric behavior onto beings we've never met? That's not exactly giving our creators a fair shakeWow. I am shocked that WaPo published an article that bluntly asks the question ""What if it *is* ET?""\s\sHopefully this article gets some traction in the MSM and goes viral on social media. Things may get really interesting in the next 3-6 months.War EagleI love that main stream media is less afraid to touch upon this subject!I think this is actually happening folks. I think we are on the cusp of disclosureGlad this is being brought up again (and I hope again and again) because no one seemed to fricken notice the first time!It's crazy that all the good UFO stuff is locked behind a paywall because its from a legit news site.The idea what if it‚Äôs aliens that would actually be less dangerous than Russians or Chinese is incredibly arrogant. We can only guess as to their capabilities and intentions and should be very cautious.Roswell was what 73 years ago?

We've already made life hard for large whales.Its as if we're not supposed to go poking around down thereAliens are far less scary than whatever might lurk in the shadows deep in the ocean.I seem to remember a situation where someone found a beacon checked it out and killed the entire population of an atmospheric processing colony along with most of an expeditionary detachment. Building better worlds my ass.What?Don't they blur out all unusual structures on the moon massive ones?Yes NASA denied but they had a dept. comprised of a few people to wash out 5So tired of the ""we doubt it's aliens""to me it's intellectual narcissism on the part of many scientists.Yet ignoring the things in our own sky.I will never trust NASA unless they show us the stuff that Gary McKinnon found on their servers.I‚Äôm out of the loop on this one. What‚Äôs the story?>Gary McKinnon\s\sInteresting.Here for the loop>These are things like radio signals or even megastructures; that is artificial objects on a gigantic scale such as hypothesized star-sized supercomputers. \s\sWhy not just call it a *Death Star*?I think we need them to put geostationary satellites pointed at the oceans.Stupid. Why not just contact the intelligence that is here and ask.Why the fuck does it have to be quiet? Let us know your searching for shit we have no idea what to expect. It‚Äôll be interesting if anything comes out of this.It's not quiet they have been doing this for years. The title is just clickbait.They're in Antarctica........your welcomeWaste of moneyTabby's Star may also have a Dyson sphere according to it's strange light changing behaviorThe thing with Dyson spheres / Ringworlds etc is if in theory possible where would the raw materials to actually build them come from?One theory is that they are built like a puzzle from multiple spaceships/satelites.  Much like the ISS which was enlarged and upgraded over time.I'm sure it took a really long time but probably from nearby planets. Mine and then fabricate and then transport.You know if you assume controlled full-knowledge disclosure (and the even more extreme alien-planned disclosure) and the eth then everything any part of the government does might be assumed to be in preparation for disclosure and public alien contact. So for example a 'hunt for alien megastructures' might mean 'searching' and 'finding' an alien megastructure then another and another (amazing!) to ease the public into the idea of alien life and alien civilizations. Then lo and behold aliens are visiting us; crazy! Though the government was aware of all of this the whole time\s\sA doubtful idea but conceivably possibleWhat a waste of money and should not be funded. It's all guess work and assumptions for what exactly? They should use that money to thoroughly investigate what we are seeing on this planet right now. SETI seems like a bunch of astronomers who simply like playing with radio telescopes but don't really want to think about how to really find intelligent life. I suspect advanced cultures have something better than radio to communicate with across distances. They should investigate the science behind faster than light communication using quantum mechanics. \s\sInstead fund a research team looking at UAPs and USOs. They appear to be intelligent already. Would put SETI out of a job as they only want to look outwards and playing astronomer so they don't really want to find ET intelligence it appears.

0,classified,UFObelievers,23,"What if the UAPTF reached out to NASA to request that the task force brief them on the classified aspects of UFOs?\s\sWhat if it included the Space Station manager and a NASA official who previously worked for Bigelow Aerospace?\s\sBecause that's EXACTLY what happened: https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/uap-task-force-initiated-contact-with-nasa-to-brief-them-on-ufos-but-they-wont-say-why\s\s(Edit: I can see my original post could be read two ways if someone didn't bother to read the article so I added a word to clarify)What impact does this have on everything?

I want to say these Germans in Sonora California working on their anti-grav airships said they could fly across the country.\s\sAs for the hypothesis yeah I agree with m3551xh.Carl Jung proposed the same theory about UFOsOr it could be demons. Pause. Ok so if I grew up Christian or some other religious back ground I would latch on to this explanation tightly. Or I if I just watched the matrix a bunch. Why is it so difficult to believe that an alien civilian has been visiting us?Because of social conditioning.I'm not Christian but I sincerely doubt they are demons but I also doubt they are from our plain of existence entirely. I'm a firm believer these beings or entities are interdimensional and are not from a physical place like Mars or Kappakappa 321382. I mean because.of the sizer of our blah blah blah I'm sure there are life forms out there probably even incredibly intelligent and advanced life forms but I think alot of people sadly and unfortunately just can't or refuse to grasp just how much Earth and the milky way in general is literally in the middle of no where. I'm not saying you don't understand or know just how lost and hidden we are in the universe but yeah. Since I came to believe these Craft's and beings and interdimensional I can totally see the demon correlation now. Which I never been able to do and I use to scoff at people who did make that correlation.  Because what I find creepy any maybe you will too is that once we die we will be on the same plain of exsistenc as these beings.Imagine playing a computer game. A game you played hundreds of times. When suddenly a ufo appears in your game. It wasnt meant to be there. Still it is there. And it disappears.\sConclusion? They are an anomaly in your game.\sIf our reality has a digital layout made of data and why not because even DNA has data. Why not the universe?\sUFOs and aliens can be a 'virus' anomaly in our reality. Popping up whenever and wherever it wants.It's funny you said this I was actually pondering this today. Do you know if others have wrote on this idea and also maybe expand on what brought you to this conclusion?You should play Signal Simulator.I'Ve got a question here. Does he say ""TikToks"" or what word does he use? ""Tic Tocs""? And if so what does this mean? Because I am really confused about this word :([deleted]Ah the ending reminds me of something.\s\sThere were once heavy electric phenomena going on in our athmosphere you know like northern lights but probably nothing looking like the northern lights of today but the electricity in the athmosphere taking on weird shapes like forming figures that must have been like dancing humans with a vibrating circle around their hips.\s\sWatch the video of joe rogan with robert m. schoch about this. What I will type from now on on this post has nothing to do with the mentioned video but it delivered the basics for what I was thinking when I watched the UFO video from above.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSo as you can imagine this influenced mankind pretty heavy as seen in artwork and probably some oral traditions. Now WHAT IF these caused a genetical memory in mankind that now manifests in these UFO-thingies? Connected with the theory shown in this video is this to ""make us look up again"" and to ""inspire us""? Did these sightings in the sky these heavenly phenomenon that no human back then could understand finally parted us from the animal kingdom as we now looked to the sky and wondered about our past and future? Is it a collective experience manifesting in a way so we can all see them and even videotape them? Are these trhings supposed to spark our imagination to solve problems as a species and all? I mean I don't know how to explain it right now... is it something we cause ourselves always changing depending of our cultural background and with the purpose of reminding us that there's something bigger out there waiting for us as we should one day inherit space?\s\sARE WE projecting these things these events as a manifestation of our own thoughts desires worries needs do they remind us of staying strong and be more creative to solve the problems of our times? Is THIS the reason why there is an apparent increase of sightings?I think the data collected from abductee recollections is the most underrated information available in the ufo field today. These aren't manifestations. People from different times/places/languages all tell the same story with highly accurate detail. The answers lie within the story the abducted are telling.Or the evidence has been downplayed and covered up?Super interesting. I believe it was Terrence McKenna or Graham Hancock the JRE that first put me on to this thought. Everything we make will disintegrate or become completely unrecognizable in about 1000 years except for things made of stone.Even plastic?  \sAnd are you sure about that?  The ancient [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) has bronze in it and has been dated to about 70-60 BC.100%Great answerI believe there have been many different iterations of civilization since the beginning of time. There are countless Ooparts (out of place artifacts) that have been found that indicate so.We will never know if there‚Äôs no evidence. But it‚Äôs fun to think about.I mean did we really build them pyramids just a little over 2000 years?I don‚Äôt believe so. I‚Äôve heard some experts say they‚Äôre at least 12000 years old. Personally I don‚Äôt believe there is any way in hell they could cut and shape 1000+ ton blocks of granite with copper chisels. I feel like the proof lies in the precision.  There are polygonal megalithic stone structures all over the world that appear to be built by the same group of ‚Äúpeople‚ÄùIf old civilizations were advanced as we are why would they need to build pyramids out of stone?From the Earth yes.I've wondered this same question.  If other advanced civilizations have existed on Earth before us I'd think there would be some bit of evidence - We might find things like plastic old technology that hasn't fully degraded yet etc.  Even an old device such as the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) is recognizable as a human-made thing even though it has degraded a bit.  Also if an old advanced civilization got to the point of using fossil fuels perhaps we'd have less fossil fuels available to us than we currently do.What's your definition of advanced?Good questionOne argument speaking against that and it's ruining the whole theory for me is... Resources.\s\sAny civilization needs resources. Wood metal food lifestock.\s\sIf they were using all these resources well why is there still metal left for our civilization? Metal uranium rocks granite all the good stuff? Woods can regrow earth can be fertile again but once oil and metal is gone it's gone right?\s\sThough this isn't a concept we came up with just recently--- in Hinduism the major deity ""resets the universe"" every ... I believe I heard 1.4 billion years? Around like that but please go check it for yourself I am not 100% sure there and just heard about it very recently (1 week ago even) as a side note on another topic and haven't looked into it yet myself.As I've said elsewhere you're assuming that our civilisation is the model of perfection for an advanced society. Our way of doing things is not the only way and is arguably very inefficient. This also really depends on how long ago that civilisation existed. What if it existed during the Triassic or Jurassic?\s\sPeople tend to underestimate the vast span of history. Here is an example that I like to give. Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus are further apart in time from one another than we are from Tyrannosaurus Rex.Speaking of that...\s\sI found this site: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu98VWSRL2hrSlkvEo\_jrrw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu98VWSRL2hrSlkvEo_jrrw)\s\sAnd this video: [https://youtu.be/n85BwMBo-bE](https://youtu.be/n85BwMBo-bE)\s\sAnd this video: [https://youtu.be/Fs1JNG-K9Dc](https://youtu.be/Fs1JNG-K9Dc)\s\sThat asks some pointed questions about our human history (it seems from and engineering point of view).

0,classified,AliensAndUFOs,36,"A million. I‚Äôm calling BSYes as crazy and unbelievable as it sounds it is true.  The ETs have been abducting humans mostly from the US it seems for two generations.  I was abducted in 1964 not long after the Barney and Betty Hill case happened.  I have had decades to understand the complexities of our plight.   \s\sUnder the cover of the supposed ""medical exams"" done upon abductees they change our memories and even ideologies.  And our DNA so that our off-spring will be less aggressive more thoughtful beyond our basic animalistic ways.  suffice it to say as in an old joke of mine *they make us and our children into liberal Democrats* ready to discard the old ways and embrace the new.  These children today are the disenfranchised frustrated ones that we see around us today that they themselves see no clear way forward.  \s\sSeveral factors are concurrently working to bring the world to its knees that will in turn led to a growing consciousness that we are all united and the world should be refashioned into a sane state of balanced ecological  sanity and equality for all living matter.  But old structures of mankind tangible and intangible must fail/change/disappear before we can be welcomed to the higher levels of intelligence that thrive in the cosmos.    \s\sAll done for a good reason but few citizens--not to mention governments would be willing to directly take on the transition.  So higher powers have deemed that the work commence as  seemingly natural forces to speed the tearing away of the old.  Conventional governmental and social forces of the old Earth put on a show of good faith as the current civilization sinks into oblivion.  \s\sYou may learn to begrudgingly accept the goals sought for us but never will you love ETs in truth their arrival and interactions have destined the end of humanity as we know it.He looks less CIAish and more tinfoil hattish.Hot air baloonThis I would love to see and read if possible?There is a lot of talk about a military base in Antarctica with UFOs but no evidence.

0,classified,UF0,47,"Math is your answer. The have predictions about the way something is and then test that theory with math.\sThen a collection of peers reviews that math in an attempt to disprove it. If they cannot it's considered a new theory... Still not fact though. Theoretical ideas that were one believed to be set theory have later in history be proven very wrong and our whole idea of matter is changed... Like quantum theory.Too bad the math is wrong. I think we'll find out this decade that dark matter is incorrect and the reality that billions in wasted tax dollars have been lost on experiments to prove it is real will hit the science community hard. At this point they're in so deep I think they're scared of the truth it could hurt future funding.The real question. \s\sVice can be unnecessarily sensationalist on occasion but they hit the nail on the head with this piece.It is true. I have never liked VICE but they are oddly ok with being a platform for the UAP phenomenon.Imagine in the distant future mankind discovered this fifth dimension is where ""souls"" or living conscientiousness goes to rest after death The implications would be ridiculous. What happens to (most) religion? Which ones remain relevant? Which ones collapse? Or do they eventually rationalize this? And incorporate into their belief systems?Ask Neil deGrasse Tyson how he would do it with recent admissions about U.F.O.'s he is trying to walk back years of denial. That would be a good starting template.That's a huge misunderstanding of dark matter. u/teflonPrawn's statement on this thread is absolutely spot-on. One thing they didn't mention is that dark matter's posited existence is consistent with current scientific understanding of astrophysics because it is all founded on theories that have been proved accurate time and time again. All physics rest on some simple laws and it's where the dynamics of interacting forces are seen that things get more and more complex such that you eventually need huge supercomputers to ""do the math."" \s\sEssentially the very same laws that apply to understanding the dynamics of a ball thrown by a toddler are the same that govern all matter in the universe and since the ""laws of physics"" have been demonstrated to be accurate time and time again and are assumed to be the same in the entire observable universe so we find that something strange is afoot. When astrophysicists make detailed estimates of the amount of matter in galaxies they find that there simply isn't enough of it to keep the galaxies from flying apart. Therefore it is reasoned physicists predict that there must be a form of matter that is presently unobservable in any direct way by the means available to us EXCEPT for its gravitational interaction with ""baryonic"" matter. There are no positive claims being made as to what its nature actually is and our effort to understand dark matter could very well be the key to lock on the door to an entirely new understanding of physics. If not and they're totally wrong that's very exciting as well because we'd somehow have to reconcile observations with theory in a way unimaginable to most of us.[deleted]Or the previous physics is incomplete / wrong (i.e relativity and QM relativity and black holes).The moment world governments admit it is a real phenomenon it gives credible scientists the real go ahead to use grant money for research into alternate energy sources. Likely sources that can‚Äôt be sold. \s\sThe entire world economy runs literally on the petrol dollar. What if that rug was pulled out from us immediately? \s\sWhen something is made in China it‚Äôs not the labor that exponentially inflated costs by the time it gets to market or the manufacturing. It‚Äôs the shipping and getting it to where it needs to go by burning dinosaur bones. \s\sThink what you will about disclosure but an immediate announcement puts a finite and maybe even immediate (if we already have this tech-we do) death sentence to oil and the world economy. \s\sTook me over a decade to realize this. It‚Äôs the real reason for secrecy I believe.It would if some magic little box pop out of flying saucer we would be able to reproduce it on mass scale and give it away to everyone on earth equally. Now can you see that happens anytime soon? :) First hydrogen photovoltaic and windmills have to be played out and this change is now tokamaks and artificial suns are nextThere‚Äôs plenty of evidence for dark matter we just don‚Äôt have a physical quantity of it. Dark matter is detected by its affects on regular matter and we have observed these affects change in anticipated ways. The only aspect of UFOs that we can verify with this level of confidence is that sometimes there are lights in the sky that cannot be identified. All other details are often different from experience to experience. Even the commonly held belief of the greys is really more a mythology than an observation. Most of what we claim to know comes essentially from word of mouth.>There‚Äôs plenty of evidence for dark matter\s\sThis so much.    It's clear that either our understanding of physics is wrong or there's extra matter out there.  \s\sUFOs/UAPs probably are similar -- radar tapes probably exist that confirm something moving in our atmosphere in ways human technology could not replicate.  But Dark Energy can't start a panic -- proof of Aliens might.Dark matter is inferred by gravitational effects seen in cosmology. So it's a second order inference. But it's based on an assumption built from Michelson-Morley to disprove aether theory. Which ironically almost exactly the same interferometry experiment was used (with greater precision) to confirm the existence of gravity waves. There's a fundamental disconnect in the physics community here.Lol as a physics graduate this title really triggered me.No one says it doesnt exists sure but lets be completely honest here dark matter is temporal construct to explain away the matter distribution across the universe hence 'dark'. So that it would make 'sense' with our observations which in the end might turn out completely different. I love to watch science festivals when all these scientists - celebrities just sit and group talk about universe and stuff but it often reminds me conversations about ufos :). Complete speculation based on observations and deduction based on math but zero evidence nor lab testing methodology and they all agree that 'we just dont know' whats out there but these are the leading candidates. And they all know very well you cant drag everything on the lab table and dissect it yet you gotta work with it somehow and push the narrative forward.\s\s If we now move to ufology there is similar narrative. For instance there is such a commandor Fravor and Nimitz fuzzy grainy video who claims he saw incredible things and we just 'gotta believe him'. If we do what then? He clearly saw 'dark matter' on his own eyes it was there it flew away why someone who is willing to study and know the science behind that considered a kook in scientific community while guy talking about 'invisible' literally matter a ghost particles literally ghost surrounding each atom in proportion 12:1 or more being taken serious? This is a challenge not for us to tackle but we can all agree its absolutely fucking idtiotic prejudice.\s\sNow point is this - what benefit will give us that we will detect dark matter which they will announce as some derivative form of neutrino like they did with Higgs bozon which just conveniently appeared in certain GeV mass scale and what benefit would give us cracking the ufo technology? Wasn't that what science was all about? Lack of balls and prejudice is really hurting our progress these clever guys at Heidelberg in Max Planck institute could be studying now the crashed Roswell craft as we speak.\s\sIf the early 1900s scientist would also be such a prejudiced ball less cowards(but cant blame them) we would be probably writing these posts as telegrams :)Dark matter is fantasy material invented to balance mathematical equations.Because all this ‚Äúscience‚Äù around dark matter and strings is attempts to theoretically justify the continued maintenance of Newtonian/Cartesian dead world monotheistic World view. Ufology and less accepted science like quantum mechanics rely on things very similar to animism and panosychism which Europe has spent between 500 and 2000 years trying to destroy to center itself and enrich its elites.Mainstream science is corrupt and telling lies purposely or through peer reviewed ignorance.Because there IS evidence for Dark Matter. It's just not known what the cause of it is yet hence it's name. [https://www.uaptheory.com/](https://www.uaptheory.com/) \s\sJust read here that they are actually thinking of ditching the dark matter explanation for something more related to quantum gravity with the expanding universe having a more likely explanation based in entropy.  Sounds cool but I got a D in P-chem II so I will probably need someone to explain it to me.I think dark matter is the same concept as the 'ether' from the 19th century. \s\sSome day we'll understand the principles and there won't be the need for that construct anymore. \s\sAs for UFOs it's probably the same. It's a construct that we made since we don't know anything about the true nature of the phenomenon. \s\sScience doesn't accept that construct because of the ridicule that comes with it.Thank you OP. That is the heart of the issue. Career suicide ought to not even be a thing. Let‚Äôs change that rh and rn.Dark matter was ""selling"" but other than that who ever considred it serious ?\s\sit was a mean to an end.... need funding talk dark matter..\s\sneed paper published ? need audience = dark matter but i don't belive it has any real credibility...ever!Sorry.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/UF0) if you have any questions or concerns.*Over a decade and billions of dollars later not even so much as a bread crumb of evidence for dark matter. Almost comical in a wayr/titlegoreProbably because a lot of nutters and crazy people believe in UFOs being alien ships and while not everyone that believes in aliens and ufos are crazy the crazy ones just tend to get the most publicity dark matter in the other hand is on the cutting edge of theoretical physics and is respected due to the people that believe in it those being respected physicists. So really the legitimacy of a certain subject really depends on the people surrounding itThere is a whole field devoted to studying questions like this about science it‚Äôs called Science & Technology Studies (STS). The scholar Harry Collins has written about the sociology of the non-detection of Gravity Waves (and then their eventual detection) so I‚Äôd definitely recommend this as an instructive case study or analog. Other ‚Äúsciences without a subject‚Äù include astrobiology the hypothetical study of potential extraterrestrial life and what they do is study earth analogs like extremeophiles and the bigger question of the origin of life.Because the UFO topic if true would change everything about our existence.  All the world's religions the earth's history everything.\s\sDark matter is just another thing we don't understand and doesn't have immediately identifiable impact upon our place in the scheme of things.  Edit: meaning to the everyday person.I think that could be an simple answer. Our understanding of physics could be and probably is wrong. And how interesting that would be. Religion would be turned inside out and upside down for one huge reason. Science and religion go hand in hand.Haven‚Äôt seen any of these before. Second vid could possibly be Starlink but the rest look legit.I saw something like the third one when I was a kid with my brother and my cousins. I remember the way it moved going up slowly but going down fast in a zigzag patternEXPLOSION!!!2 short sightings in Spain and India and the rest of the video is flooded with USA and Russian ones. Should change the title broBut if expectations drove the form why are we seeing tic-tacs and getting these on video? They're not expected and make no more sense than classical saucers. On the other hand the mysterious airship flap did seem like mimickry or foreshadowing the very next technological step.\s\sThe same with the use of propellers.\s\sIf these are all connected in a consistent way I may propose a new hypothesis -\s\sThe 'visitors' are able to create either\s\s1. illusionary craft (that are material enough to appear on video and camera) but not necessarily physical as we understand it\s2. possess physical craft that can shape shift by advanced programmable materials\s3. construct purpose made craft that change in appearance over time and in different missions\s\sand that one motive for this apart from for technical reasons evolution of our weaponry is that the craft are intended to get us to think technologically about flight. The airship flap was intending to start the process of human flight.\s\sFlying saucers might be the next step and already achieved and whatever these tic-tacs are the step after that.\s\sI don't put a lot of stock in this. I think whilst it is true that human expectations do influence what is described in reports this in part can be due to the effect of memory and post-experience rationalisation.\s\sThere is also a during-experience rationalisation that can influence what is being seen or not seen. The most well known example of this is the man in the gorilla outfit at the basket ball game that most people do not see despite being close to the centre of vision. The brain already knows that people dress strangely at sporting events and so totally screens it out.\s\sSo we then have some further things to consider -\s\sThe UFO is not fully physical and its appearance is entirely manifested by the desire of its operator\s\sThe UFO is not fully physical and its appearance is manifested by the combined observation of the operator and the external human observers and might be thought of as existing at the interface of 'dimensions'.\s\sThe UFO is not fully physical and is entirely manifested by human observers\s\sThe UFO is what it is and physical but appears differently to us which manifests its appearance to the extent recordable on camera by a strange bubble that interacts with us the observer\s\sThe UFO may impact human observation perception independently of cameras and the UFO may cause hallucinations as a by product of fields that it generates both intentionally or not intentionally.\s\sAny combination of the above could be occurring.\s\sEDIT typosIn all cases all happens as if it was an intended enigma to solve in order to stimulate humanity a stimulus shaped in the form of an enigma.\s\sMythological creatures of antiquity or in many cultures often present an enigma to the heroes once this latter solves the enigma it gives him somehow a key that helps him in his quest/goal. Sometimes the hero is blocked until he finally solves the enigma and can continue to move forward.Vall√©e is referring to a control system which is global and specific to humans. I believe he is suggesting something so complicated and controversial that it can‚Äôt be explained without serious ridicule or with our current scientific methods. He has tried to explain it many times but people simple don‚Äôt understand. My interpretation of his writings and the evidence is that when he says human consciousness he is referring to a human gestalt consciousness. In other words the control system is our combined awareness or ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äù trying to interact with us to assist us.... very much like how we take a synthetic drug to interact with our cells for longevity. \s\sIf that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense that‚Äôs what I mean by complicatedHi could you please explain further what you think? if you like please pm me.

0,classified,RealLifeConspiracy,10,So the last part that this video makes is that pharisees and other egyptians had a spell for preventing the loss of a man's heart in the afterlife a punishment given to those who essentially lie or who were not good during their life. For example a thief would cast this spell to prevent the overlords/gods from seeing that he indeed was a thief (and pretending that he was not) allowing him into paradise. I love how people no matter who or when are convinced that they can deceive those that they would call gods especially if a god were truly omnipotent then they would be fully aware of your attempts to deceive them in it's entirety would they not?My question is \sAre these objects a product of Earthling technology \sOr alien . . . .these aliens look uglyThis is complete bullshit.

However in 2009 the Rijksmuseum of the Netherlands declared that the ""goodwill Moon rock"" it had received in 1992 from the estate of Netherlands Prime Minister Willem Drees was bogus. This ""Moon rock"" which had been exhibited for more than a decade on a gold-colored piece of cardboard weighs 89 grams (3.1 ounces) ‚Äì far larger than the 1 gram piece of lunar basalt 70017 affixed to the Netherlands Apollo 17 lunar sample display. Testing of the Rijksmuseum ""Moon rock"" in 2009 showed it to be a piece of petrified wood likely from Arizona. The Rijksmuseum had insured this ""Moon rock"" for ∆í100000 (‚Ç¨50000 [$85000] in 2012 currency) upon its receipt.\s\s>An investigation showed that United States Ambassador J. William Middendorf II had presented Drees with the ""Moon rock"" on October 9 1969. The Apollo 11 astronauts were visiting the Netherlands at that time on a goodwill tour. Drees' grandson speculates that his grandfather who was nearly deaf and blind at the time formed the mistaken impression that the ""Moon rock"" he received was from the Apollo 11 mission. When Drees' ""Moon rock"" was received by the Rijksmuseum in 1992 the museum phoned NASA to verify its provenance and was told over the phone without seeing the piece that it was ""possible"" it was a Moon rock. USA Today says the discovery of a bogus ""Moon rock"" at the Rijksmuseum should serve as a wake-up call for all the countries of the world and all the states of the United States that received the Apollo 11 and 17 lunar plaque displays from the Nixon administration to locate the displays and fully secure them.\s\s>According to Moon rock researcher Robert Pearlman both the Netherlands Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 lunar sample displays are in the National Museum of the History of Science and Medicine in Leiden Netherlands.Why is this being downvoted?Tree's used to live on the moon.

Thompson grandkids who will most certainly fail to live up to the family name.His great great grandson will be soon winning the award for proving that they are in fact 'Wavicles'. ah the long conSmarter than me and my dad.The best father son game of one up ever.I don't browse reddit as much as most people but this is the 3rd time seeing this from a casual redditor by the way.[Here's](http://images.npg.org.uk/800_800/7/2/mw69672.jpg) a sweet family portrait of them\sWhat a twist.Unfortunately the barman charged them both for their beer. I bet dinners had some intense debates.By our powers combined we become CAPTAIN PARTICLE!\s\s\sI'll show myself out....His grandson will win one for showing that electrons don't actually exist. This was like a whole 2 months of my physics degree. Classic father son duality.damn son where'd you find this\sI don't know if you're waves or particles but you go down smooth!Did Louis De Broglie get one for saying the Son and the Father were both correct?TIL: Children always think different than dad :) The biggest ""That's my son"" moment in historyDoes he have a grandson? Because that area of physics still needs work!and his grandson became a hippie.Don't study my or my son's electrons ever again.whats HIS son doing ?Who got the one for wave-particle duality? His grandson?Amazingly gifted individuals.  My uncle then earned one in 1985 with [this](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) scientific discovery.Interesting fact is they were both right. All electrons have a wave-particle duality exhibiting characteristics of both.Seems like they both had positive results.So you could have seen who had the prize depending on whose house you looked in.in between De Broglie won it for showing they were bothPor qu√© no los dos?are ions required or involved in these electron waves?Ions are atoms which are missing or have extra electrons giving them an electric charge. They have little to do with electron particle/wave duality.Thomson and his colleagues at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory used to laud the fundamental particle with the toast: ""The electron: may it never be of use to anyone.""\s\sMan they sure were wrong about that. In class my professor told us that because it was so small it was useless in their minds.\sAren't waves made of particles?They're the same thing just in different conditions. They act like waves until they're observed (i.e. they interact with some other system) and then they start acting like particles. I JUST was told this last week at a Story Telling in Teaching seminar.  At first I was all ""ugh repost"" and then realized nope just coincidence!It made me happy to look up and see that he was still alive when his son won his award. So is this accepted in Wave-Particle Duality? It's still one thing exhibiting behaviors of both in truth fuck if we know what they are they don't even truly exist until observed a probability wave is literally not in existence... Damn nature you crazy tf is matter then? Another fun fact: William H. Bragg shared a Nobel prize with William L. Bragg his son.\sLike father like son.Then he killed his sonSomething tells me our data gathering abilities are way beyond our capacity to make sense of it.Sounds like the case of ""Fuck you Dad I didn't even want to be a physicist!"" in history. They aren't either such thing. Those are only allegories.TIL that this person was straight.

\sAm I the only one that feels this was completely unnecessary information to include in his bio?Any reason why sexual orientation seems relevant to the bio? Awkward Thanksgiving dinner conversations..So if I find a way to prove that waves are electrons will I win it for coming full circle?Science is a bitch SOME times.Meh. I learned that yesterday. #YILThis is a complete misunderstanding of light frequency. A Photon does not vibrate enough to show any signs of Electron stability. NASA BS lies as usual.With the discovery of the Higgs boson particle (and the Higgs field) we now understand the mechanics of what's happening. Particles exist and as they pass through the Higgs Field the resulting friction is experienced by us as electro-magnetism.\s\sThis process gives bosons [particles like photons] heft and mass. This electro-magnetic value given to every physical particle is responsible for the phenomenon of what we perceive as ""gravity"".\s\sElectrons are subject to the same process. They are particles. But as they pass in a straight line through space it is the space around them that is bent--giving the illusion of a wave effect.\s\sThe electrons themselves are never deviating from their straight path. But because the space in front of them is warping it gives the appearance to outsiders as if the particles are traveling on a wave [when in reality they're not].\s\sThink of the heat-waves over a grill. If you send an object up through it in a perfectly straight line the resulting waves from the rippling air will make the object *appear* to be traveling in a wave . . . when in reality it's not.\s\sIn the case of electrons the ""air"" is the Higgs Field. It is the medium the particle is traveling through as it gets from one side of the Ether to the other. On one side of the permeable curtain it's a mass-less boson; on the other side of the curtain as it enters our universe [due to the resulting electro-magnetic charge] it acquires heft and becomes what we perceive as a particle.\s\s* Footnote: http://www.independent.com/news/2012/jul/20/higgs-field-new-ether/ Interestingly three years before JJ Thomson won the Nobel Prize for describing electrons as particles an Italian mathematician named Olinto DePretto correctly described what we today know as the ""Higgs Boson"" effect. In fact he coined E=mc2 (several years before Einstein) to describe the phenomenon. DePretto's discovery was ignored largely because Einstein banned the Ether upon which the theory relied. Einstein himself later admitted (after Quantum Mechanics proved it) that the Ether was in fact real. But in the early part of the 20th Century when DePretto submitted his work the Establishment was turning against the Ether (so the damage was done). Today the Ether has noq quielt been re-instated in Physics albeit now euphemistically called ""The Higgs Field"" to save face. But the Higgs Field has most of the same attributes as the classical Ether. Long story short: DePretto's description of the phenomenon turned out to be correct. Because he was so far ahead of his time he never received a Nobel Prize for his discovery of the ""Higgs boson"" effect nor for his coining of E=mc2. His contribution to Physics can't be overstated. (But his work is still largely ignored--because it would force the Establishment to have to re-evaluate Einstein's legacy in terms of having banished the Ether from physics. An act that set back Science 100 years. It was a blunder as massive as someone denying that gravity existed--and getting the establishment to go along with it for a century.)>Olinto DePretto correctly described what we today know as the ""Higgs Boson"" effect\s\sNo he didn't. You sound as the same people that say that Bible predicted this or that. No no it didn't. There is a giant leap between DePretto's theory and the Standard Model.ah the long con!Why do they bother putting sexual orientation in the database?[deleted]Please read about the Higgs Boson discovery it seems you have also got some misinformation.""FUCK YOU DAD THEY'RE WAVES"". \s\sROFL this is fantastic.That's twice now that the science has been settled.Well that's gonna make for some awkward Thanksgiving Dinners.Given that he was English I doubt he would have celebrated Thanksgiving.Why?

I am against the death penalty. I believe following the principle of ""an eye for an eye"" makes you no better than the one committing the crime. \s\sThe only time I can ever see it necessary for someone to be killed is if that is the only way to prevent them from killing others. However when the death penalty is enacted that person is not in a position to hurt others.\s\sNegative reinforcement is not particularly effective with human beings so the death penalty as a deterrent is not really that valid. However lifelong imprisonment can provide a strong enough deterrent in addition to keeping the convicted murderer safely away from society. This is also a more humanitarian approach and shows respect for human life as a whole.\s\sI can certainly understand emotional reasons behind wishing a murderer dead. However for me it is morally wrong to advocate the death of another.The death penalty is wrong for many reasons. For one thing our justice system is not perfect. We get it wrong. Texas has recently put two innocent men to death that we know about. There are probably more. When we put them to death we deny their right to due process. When evidence of their innocence comes to light there is no way for them to be set free because they are dead. The punishment is too much for our imperfect system.\s\sFurthermore it's cruel and unusual punishment. Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan had it right when they took the position that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. At no point did either justice accept the Supreme Court‚Äôs holding in *Gregg v. Georgia* which held the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment.In an article by New Scientist it was revealed that when 43 of 49 people executed were studied they did not have adequate anesthesia and as a result likely would have felt feelings of asphyxiation severe burning sensations muscle cramping and cardiac arrest. It was also noted that due to the muscle relaxants given to the person being executed they were unable to move or otherwise express the amount of pain they felt. They had to suffer in silence as they died a cruel and painful death. \s\sIt also violates human dignity. When we lock someone up the odds that they are going to escape are extremely slim. We have the capacity to put people away forever and make sure they are no longer a threat to society. Once we have them locked up forever there's no reason to put them to death other than primal urges for retribution. We shouldn't act on those instincts. We're better than that.[Because of this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/15/carlos-texas-innocent-man-death). There is no moral way for an imperfect court to issue permanent sentences.For a lot of us the death penalty is seen as an easy way out especially if you don't believe in any sort of hell.\s\sI know if someone killed my son I'd much rather he be locked in a cage for the rest of his life to suffer guilt and regret only to die at the end anyway.\s\sOh plus with the death penalty you can't reverse it if someone is found guilty but later found innocent.This is going to be short compared to the other posts. Watch The Thin Blue Line. It is an immensely compelling and sad movie that explores the distinct short comings in our justice system. The death penalty is void if it takes the life of one innocent person. [deleted]Prison is where Zip zop zoobity bop you're gonna rot.It's expensive but at least you can apologise and compensate the person somewhat if new evidence is found and it turns out they were innocent. \s\sDeath has no ""undo"".Maybe Cosby wanted the man to suffer as long as possible instead of getting the easy way out. He's probably a sadistic man who wanted to inflict as much punishment as possible. Haha.\s\sUnrelated: I wanted to point out his comments on black communities and the crime surrounding them was intelligent and well said.Out of sadism?Yeah I'd rather die than be in prison forever.> I can't even talk the way these people talk: 'Why you ain't' 'Where you is'... You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth!""Cosby was also a college football player for Temple U. That's because he knew that living in prison for a life time is way worst than just dying and being done with it. This doesn't mean that he forgave him.Dad always told me I helped born you into this world and I can take you out! ‚ÄúBill Cosby said some real shit and the whole world freaked out on him. For what? For having an opinion? Just because he was selling pudding pops for the last 20 years people forget that he‚Äôs a nigga from Philly in the projects and he might say some real shit from time to time.‚Äù\s- Dave ChappelleWhat was this in context to? This is very important. I don't want to spark a race riot but the black community has some real issues and the larger part of that community tries to make having these issues ""cool"". Black Americans like Bill Cosby that stand up and say ""Enough is enough start acting civil take care of yourselves take care of your families and stop blaming other people for your problems"" are vilified by the black community.  The whole [acting white](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_white) thing is ridiculous. It's not ""acting white"" most of the time it's acting responsible learning proper grammar fitting in with the community around you educating yourself and striving to be a better person trying to give more to your children than you were given and treating everyone equally..... In many parts of black America this is considered ""acting white"" and it is looked down on. Many black people look down upon Barack Obama because he is just ""acting white"" because he educated himself tried hard and speaks proper English because a ""real nigga don't be fuckin wit no white folk. A real nigga be stayin tru tru to his hood. A real nigga don't be pullin no Bill Cosby shit tellin other niggaz how da be treatin folk. Dat nigga Cosby need ta shut da fuk up"". It's an awful shame that more famous and respectable black Americans don't step forward like Bill Cosby and and speak up about the ignorance in black counter culture. LeBron James Barack Obama Michelle Obama  Laurence Fishburne  Will Smith   Beyonce Oprah Omar Epps Rihanna  Derek Jeter Tyler Perry  Michael Jordan Maya Angelou James Earl Jones  Neil Degrasse Tyson Morgan Freeman Venus Williams Ken Griffey Jr  Don Cheadle Kobe Bryant Jamie Foxx Usher Denzel Washington Magic Johnson Halle Berry Mos Def Dave Chappelle Lenny Kravitz Levar Burton Danny Golver.... Where are these people. All of them ""act white"" by trying hard succeeding speaking with proper grammar educated themselves beyond street talk... These are the people that need to stand up behind Bill Cosby and should have come to his side when he was lynched by his own people. word.I dreamt that I was at an outdoor concert and Bill Cosby approaches the group I'm with. He's very friendly and casual but then I take my phone out to take a pic of him so he gets offended and leaves.  I felt bad.  :( lolDid this remind anyone else of [Cry The Beloved Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry_The_Beloved_Country#Plot_summary)?Well I'd rather die than live in pain for lifedid anyone else click on Sun Myung Moon? that shit is crayThat's cool that he is willing to stick by his own personal beliefs but I don't like the implication that it would be considered inferior if someone who is pro death penalty would remain that way if someone close to them was murdered. Or if they decided the death penalty was necessary after being personally affected. Bill Cosby is one of the greatest comedians of all time. He kept his routines clean and never had to curse.  It makes me sad when people only remember him for the couple years he did jello commercials or how Family Guy portrayed him as some bumbling idiot shouting random words.  Listen to any of his stand up and you'll see how much of a comedic genius he was. Pudding industry shill.  niceI wonder what he thinks about abortion.  You know parents killing their own children.I wonder what he thinks about Mitosis. You know cells dividing on their own.I didn't realize that 85-year-old women posted on Reddit.\s\sWhy don't you go knit something gramma?Death is too easy.I dont think this means Bill Cosby supports murder it just shows his stand point on the death penalty.What a guy.The only positive outcome that I can think of for the death penalty it is that tax dollars are being saved. They are not. People wait an eternity in their cells because if the state kills someone they got to make sure they got the real culprit. The legal proceedings are more often resumed anew because nobody wants to die.\s\sHere are some [stats](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty).I remember when his son was killed because it was so shocking. You just never imagine something so horrific happening. He was shot to death by son young kid who if I remember offhand was 19 or so. He is currently serving life in prison.   His son was studying for his Doctorate in Education and for a time Bill Cosby had a foundation called ""Hello Friend"" which is how his son used to greet people.  I always admired that he truly was working towards his goals and not riding his father's coattail.  I also remember watching Rita Moreno being interviewed after Ennis's death and absolutely BAWLING saying what a nice kid he was and how she had known him since he was little. \sWow I forgot how sad that whole thing made me. Bill Cosby is a mother fucking pimp.\s\sIt's a fucking shame that such a seemingly successful and happy person that he was has transformed into the grumpy old man he is today.It takes a truly remarkable individual to refuse to give in to the desire for revenge in a situation like that.  I hope that I could do the same.I think mainly he sees the irony in it when you murder to say that you are against murder.I am against the death penalty completely. However if someone murdered my son or daughter then I would not hesitate to rip them into several hundred pieces. The victim or a member of the victim's party should never be the moral decider of a situation because they have no moralsI'd rather die than sit in a cell getting buttfucked for the rest of the time I was alive. \s\sI'm sure he knew what his life would've been like sitting in that cell dying would be getting off easy.Most of the develop world has been like this for quite a few decades now only in America is death considered revenge. Many places had a 30 or 40 year gap between their last execution and abolishment of the death penalty mostly because people realized it was not an acceptable punishment anymore.\s\sThankfully a dozen of America's states have abolished it however they're all particularly small.Why is executing a man considered ""revenge"" and making him rot in a prison where he will be surrounded by violence not? And either way why is ""revenge"" a bad word in this context?Bill Cosby is an amazingly strong man and an inspiration. I had the privilege of going to one of his shows in the later 90's. He did a comedy piece about his son's childhood and when that was over gave a heartfelt piece of advice to cherish those you care about. He was in tears I was in tears the whole audience was cutting onions. And then like the pro he is snapped back into his routine and had everyone laughing in seconds. I would love to simultaneously high-five and hug him.Personally I don't see why it's SO wrong to want the death penalty. Let's just say that whoever the suspect was in this case ABSOLUTELY committed the murder and there is no doubt. Our options are to execute him leave him in jail forever or let him go.\s\sThe option that balances cost-effectiveness and safety of others is execution and I believe it's the most ""realistic"" option- there are billions of people on the planet consuming its resources why waste them on a scumbag murderer?I hope I never have to consider this situation in real life.I don't think there's anything credible about it. I'd give in to the desire for revenge because that's what the guy deserves.>refuse to give in to the desire for revenge\s\sDid he?  He may see life in prison as more of a punishment than the death penalty.  Let the guy rot for decade after decade instead of effectively ending his sentence after a relatively short period of time.\s\sI don't have kids or anything to watch grow up but I think life in prison would be worse. Ghandi's son's attempted to stop the execution of his assassin but they failedHonestly I disagree. The death penalty can be highly appropriate for a number of situations. Let the punishment fit the crime: you killed someone in cold blood for no good reason? BAM. Death comes to you.Is it not revenge to have the person behind bars for (hopefully) the rest of their life having to face what they've done? Whereas once they're dead they do not know suffering or guilt or deprivation. Good guy Bill Cosby?  Bout to get on a plane maybe someone can make this happen.Kind of sums up how ridiculous internet culture is when Bill Cosby is mostly considered a punchline and someone like Drew Carey a great talent.I had the pleasure of meeting this man randomly in Red Bank New Jersey after he had just got done speaking at some theatre many years ago. I was only eight at the time but I remember him being extremely polite to my parents and to me and striking conversation. Fantastic gentleman.You're probably thinking of Count Basie Theater.FUCK Bill Cosby! He bought the rights to the little rascals and had it removed from ever being aired again because he said it was racist towards black people. Not one kid I grew up with ever felt that way and I had Chinese polish Italian AND black friends! Everyone of them loved that show!  TIL the same site has him credited as a ""pudding industry shill"" on another page:\s\shttp://www.nndb.com/tv/775/000050625/I'm only against the death penalty because rotting in prison should be worse than a quick painless death. That and they *miiiight* be innocent.I'm sure this will get buried and I have no way to confirm this that I would feel comfortable with since this is my main account but I actually met the guy that killed Bill Cosby's son when he was doing time at Calapatria State Prison. I had a friend who was also there and was visiting him when he introduced me to the guy (dont remember his name anymore). He told me some shit about stay in school and don't become a fuck up. I should have listened more honestly but this was probably 13 years ago now and I was a kid. The guy I was visiting told me after that he was the guy that killed Cosby's son. He seemed real remorseful and part of me felt bad for him but I knew his crime was pretty heinous and horrible. That's probably what stuck with me the most though was the true sorrow and remorse in that man's eyes and how he knew how bad he had fucked up and how much it was going to cost him. Was depressing and enlightening to say the least.good guy billAll these people hating the death penalty are the same people outraged that the govt spends more on prisoners than they do on students in universities.\s\sWell guess what? **You still have pay for that fucker rotting in his cell.** and thus perpetuating the cycle. Go ahead. Downvote me.It costs more to execute somebody than it does to sentence them life in prison. There's your shocker for the day.Let's play a game of spot-the-people-who-would-have-joined-the-Nazi-party-in-1930's-Germany.Scary isn't it?ITT everyone is praising Bill Cosby for showing mercy on his sons killer. All the while he just wanted to make sure he would suffer for the rest of his life.Good on him. It's amazing in this day and age we say murder is wrong ""unless i don't like this guy. Then i want him dead dead dead. Electrocuted in a chair holding a bowl of raw top ramen if possible"".\s\sTrying to explain to my daughter that murder is wrong but the justice system kills people is damn hard. I dread the day i have to explain the other ways society kills people like lack of affordable healthcare. ""Having a gun to kill someone with is a right but living is not""Cosby's son Ennis was a 27-year-old doctoral student at Columbia University when he was shot and killed while changing the tire on his Mercedes. The killer Mikhail Markhasev is serving a life sentence after Cosby spoke against giving him the death penalty.\s\s>Ennis\s\s>implying Cosby didnt troll the fuck out of the kid anyways with that name\s\s>implying this isnt the plot for the next GTA\s\sIf I were in his position I think I'd prefer the killer live out the rest of his life in prison than take the easy way out and die humanely.\s\sThen again a life sentence might allow parole and (depending on your location) implies only 25 years imprisonment in which case I'd rather see the fucker fry.living with the thoughts that you have killed someone must be pretty intense.My father was murdered and I'm against the death penalty as well. Putting the murderer to death wouldn't bring my father back and state-sponsored execution makes a killer out of the executioner too.Thank fucking Christ really. This is compassion good for you. The death penalty is the only time I see normally sane people suddenly believe that two wrongs DO make right.i'm so sorry for your loss.This is the thing about it. We always say it's about the victims' families but I for one would not feel one iota better if the person who murdered my loved one was also killed. In fact I would feel worse. My opinion is that giving the government the power to take a human life is too dangerous along with the risks of taking the life of an innocent.My father was also murdered. My opinion differs from yours but I respect your compassion.\s\sAnyways I'm sorry for your loss.>and state-sponsored execution makes a killer out of the executioner\s\sSo? State sponsored imprisonment makes the guards and warden kidnappers and imprisoners. That's irrelevant. The difference is that the victim of the murderer was innocent. The ""victim"" of the justice system (the criminal) is not.\s\sYa I'd rather have the murderer rot in jail for the rest of his life than have him spend *some* time then getting executed.This is why I love Bill Cosby.Just a little anecdote on Bill Cosby: He owns a house in Greenfield MA where I went to school (his property is gigantic and nicely they let a local man garden on their property).  When his son was killed the funeral homes in the area had no idea who got the account except the one who landed that account.  One of the classes I took had us visit a nearby funeral home.  It just so happened that this was the funeral home that buried his son.  The director said that the Cosby's were very private and buried him on their property.  She stood out front while they conducted a nice little service for him.\s\sIf it hasn't been said anywhere his son died while helping a stranger change their tire.That last part isn't true he died while changing his own tire. He had a friend there to help him. \s\shttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennis_Cosby#MurderAn eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.\s\sIf you murder someone in cold blood then you deserve to die imo. It's not really an eye for an eye more like a we-are-all-better-off-with-you-dead mentality. Good Guy Bill Cosby.Didn't know that. On the other hand I haven't really made that much of an effort on ""know your Cosby"". \s\sHowever the interesting question to me is why he spoke against the death penalty. Was because he's against death penalties and/or generally is a forgiving person? Or did he just want the guy to rot in jail forever and make sure he gets the worse threathment ever?Probably he feels as many do that killing another person is wrong and that capital punishment is a blot on our society.Bill Cosby is not only one of the top 5 comedians of all time but perhaps the only funny ""clean"" comedian of all time. No easy feat.I understand exactly where he is coming from there should be laws against pudding a man down.That pun was in bad taste and you should feel bad.\s\sZip zop zoobity bop.Your cleverness has left me a little Jell-ous.TIL a lot of people did not know this because they were too young..""**Cosby's son** Ennis was a 27-year-old doctoral student at Columbia University when he was shot and killed while changing the tire on his Mercedes. The killer Mikhail Markhasev is serving a life sentence after Cosby spoke against giving him the death penalty.""\s""it's easy to forget that he used to be funny"" <--- after reading this I really did not want to continue.>  it's easy to forget that he used to be funny -- and hip.\s\souch!Life in prison is worse than death imo.I remember this and another great dude Robert Anton Wilson speaking against the death penalty for the man who brutally killed his daughter in a botched robbery. He has lots to say on this subject and others.Bill Cosby was the guy who should have been commended for saying what he did to the black community. Instead he was condemned shamed and alienated from the community whose image he bolstered in the eyes of non-black people. It's a shame that the fraudsters like Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson and the NAACP are the leaders of the black community. People who reinforce the victimization mindset to line their pockets and defend niggerism at every opportunity to ensure that the victimization mindset continues unabated.\s\sThere was a time when it looked like the Black community was rising up as contributing members of society. When they were putting out real music with a positive message. Then rap and crack happened and its been a downward spiral ever since. Now we have an anti-white entitlement culture whose form of self-empowerment is attacking innocent random white people and it's all thanks to the efforts of pieces of shit like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton that help perpetuate the victimhood and injustice mindset of the black psyche.\s\sListen to people like Bill Cosby. It's not white people keeping you down. It's that nihilistic self-centered niggerism perpetuated by  rappers and race hustlers. If you want to be happy you need to have pride in yourself and contribute. You'd be surprised at how many white people want you to succeed and are willing to help you should you demonstrate the will.i am proud Temple Grad Bill Cosby's Alma Mater. He spoke at my graduation he actually speaks at literally almost EVERY graduation because Temple loves him to death rightfully so. The man is dedicated to Temple is at every sports game almost in his Temple attire and I would honestly thing go to the mattresses for this school. I remember him saying in his commencement speech as basic as possible ""you probably fucked up  you may not have done well or close to what you wanted to achieve but we all love you anyway. and if you did well well congratulations. We love you too. "" he is the man. BC all day![wikipedia entry] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennis_Cosby#Murder)It kind of sucks that more than 1/2 of his Wikipedia page is about his murder...What a senseless waste of life.Bill Cosby is the kind of guy who has so many strong opinions that I have to respect him whether or not I agree.This man is a giant.  A friend of mine was murdered earlier this year.  If you don't believe in the death sentence it takes a lot to not wish it on someone who killed a loved one.  One more reason Bill Cosby is an amazing man--and I am perhaps not so amazing.I was so confused when I first read this. I thought there was a boy who was shot and killed by his own father who Bill Crosby defended in court.Well that was dumb.No it was compassionate and forgiving. Smart man if you ask me.[deleted]As typical many people here have used their own personal desires and emotions as argument for using the death penalty. What you personally desire however is not what is actually objectively good for society. If you desired to savagely beat your wife because she did something negative as is legally alowed in many parts of the world does not mean it is objectively good. Nor is something good if it's practiced or believed in by a majority of the population. Using logic and reason are the only ways you can find out genuine truths.I don't care about any political stances or beliefs - this was classy and professional of himClassy without doubt I do not think the term ""professional"" would apply unless he was actually a lawyer or something.\s\sI think the word you were looking for was ""principled"".\s[deleted]Very classy. I don't think I would be able to do the same but he is a good man.thank youBill Cosby did more for black people in the 70's & 80's than people give him credit for.\s\sBefore the Cosby Show black people weren't given much opportunity in prime time TV and black people were stereotyped in negative roles. Along comes Cosby as a Doctor his wife a Lawyer and they showed white middle class America not to be afraid of black people.\s\sDecades later and outlets like FOX have done nothing but insinuate the negative stereotypes and push race relations back where they were in the 70's.He only wanted to speak out so he can torture him by flopping his flabber flopper with the frazzle snazzle that goes bzzow and Hooeey!Isn't this BS since the crime happened in CA death penalty didn't apply... As it has been banned there since 1972\s\s\shttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_California\s[It was reinstated in the late 70's.](http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=48)\s\s\s>August 11 1977\sLegislature re-enacts the death penalty.

Were you around a few years ago for the Tookie Williams incident? Was all over the news. Yes there are still executions going on. Damn I have so much love and respect for this man. Always have always will. He is a remarkable human being.Bill Cosby is like Morgan Freeman mixed with Johnny Carson. Classy and soothing.I'm against the death penalty but one reasonable argument for it is that it's not so much a punishment but it gives closure to victims/victims' family. \s\sAlso what happened to the killer of BC's son? Did he get the death penalty or is he still in jail? On deathrow?\s\s(on my phone having trouble searching through the thread. So i'm not sure i'm repeating other peple here)letting the guy live would be revenge.You made it sound like the killer shot the killer's own son. ConfusingGood Guy Bill. I'm expecting to find that in the comments somewhere.[This is for you Mr. Cosby.](http://i.imgur.com/kmQeK.gif)\sAnd your point is.....?Story time fellow redditors! Gather round the circle!\s\sSo when I was in fifth grade my class was scheduled to go to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield MA to see Bill Cosby speak on hate crimes and whatnot. I was so excited. Unlike my fellow classmates I was a fan of '90s television such as The Cosby Show and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I enjoyed watching Bill Cosby perform with his eccentric personality. \s\sThe day of the field trip approached and my excitement grew more and more and more by each passing day. The day before the field trip my world was crushed as I learned Cosby had cancelled his speech. I was devastated but my mom told me it was because Bill was sick. I understood and went to the Basketball Hall of Fame with my class albeit reluctantly.\s\sI wasn't expecting to see Bill there but I was surprised when it was announced to us that Bill would actually be speaking and he had flown in from Philadelphia to speak to us. His speech was great and I was so ecstatic as he came and met each one of us afterward.\s\sMy dad told me two years later that the reason he was going to cancel was because he had supposedly sexually assaulted some girl ion Philadelphia along with a multitude of others. Needless to say Bill Cosby was no longer my idol.May I point out to the Christian right you see that? That's a Christian.I consider myself part of the Christian right yet I am a Catholic and do no believe in capital punishment.I'm not sure why Reddit *loves* shit like this so much. Whats the point of making a good deed from a good man into a condescending remark about the religious right? Yeah there are a lot of Christians that aren't as moral as this guy so what? There are also a lot of blacks that aren't as moral as him. \s\sIs this one okay: ""May I point out to black people you see that? That's a black guy.""\s\sI get so sick of shit like this Reddit I'm an atheist and I get really sick of it. \s\sI'll take the wave of downvotes for speaking my mind thanks.That's a true Scotsman there.""Thou shall not kill""\sit's kind of right there. seriously you guys it's RIGHT THERE.May I point out to non-Christians that most of us aren't vengeful much like movies and society would like to paint us. If my son was murdered I would do everything I could to forgive him for what he had done no matter what happened.A very Scottish Christian at that.[deleted]There is only one thing worse than the death penalty and that's life in prison.People say this until they're in a situation where they can preserve their life at the cost of their personal freedom.\s\sIf it were universally true death row inmates wouldn't constantly trying to get their sentences commuted.If it was my son that was murdered I would hunt the mother fucker down who did it and kill him myself.\sDoesn't anyone else think this is a worse fate than death? Having to live with the terrible consequences of your actions until you die of natural causes? I suppose it depends on how tough on yourself you are but I used to think it would be the worst thing in the the world to be wrongly imprisoned but being imprisoned for something I did and knew I deserved it for would undoubtedly be worse. I like a man who will stick to his principles even in tough circumstances. I got forwarded [this fake Cosby meme](http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/billcosby/a/I-Am-76-And-I-Am-Tired-By-Bill-Cosby.htm) from a religious aunt who probably honestly believes all the hateful shit it's ranting about. \s\sNice to know that the REAL Bill Cosby is probably classier than that. [deleted]It's remarkable because people have emotions and vengeance is a rather powerful motivator.\s\sIt's remarkable because [even now 2/3rds of Americans support the death penalty](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150089/support-death-penalty-falls-year-low.aspx).\s\s[deleted]So this won't get read because the thread is too old I guess but I'll put it out there.\s\sIn the profile I read that Cosby had a mistress. So I looked her up and found this article from People: http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/02005956100.html\s\sNow People magazine is known for taking it 'light' on celebrities. They *never* write anything bad unless it can be proven and in this case it went to court. Bill Cosby drugged and raped women apparently.\s\sI know it shocked me too. Read the article for yourself see what you think.Man I just can't see that pic of Cosby without [thinking of this](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/tunak).Who the hell would kill Bill Cosby's son?The death penalty is WRONG and I'm so proud of anyone that can put personal feelings aside to help justify that the idea of murder in any sense as horrific and that every man woman and child is better than their worst crime.  +1 Karma to Cosby!! :P\sYeah the death penalty is wrong. Let's all serial killers like Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer have their rights and live on after claiming the lives of many people! They really deserved a chance to live after their horrific crimes. \s\sI understand your point and you have the right to feel that way. But I agree with the death penalty. I think it has gotten rid of some of the worst scum. Jeffrey Dahmer for example. Or Charles Manson who is awaiting his opportunity to be next in line on death row. People who do not deserve to live. I say Let the fuckers fry. They deserve it. Karma is a bitch and the death penalty is karma fighting back. TIL Bill Cosby's son was murdered.Much better idea. Have him suffer in prison.And the killer was never seen again some say he turned him into pudding pops. Glory to morality.Bill Cosby. Moral man.The title should be more clear that the son is of Bill Cosby and not the killer.Bill Cosby did another remarkable thing in connection with his son's murder.  His son was killed very late at night.  Earlier in the day a young black girl back East had been murdered and her killing was a lead story in the news until Ennis Cosby was killed - at which point the media seemed to forget about the little girl entirely.\s\sThe next day (less than 12 hours after his son's murder) Bill Cosby got on the phone and called the little girl's mother.  Amid his own grief he reached out to offer his condolences to another person - a stranger - who had just lost her child.  That took a lot of compassion and a lot of class. \s\sEdit:  Typed the wrong word. Oh my god is that true? I genuinely don't think I'd have that kind of strength.This whole thread's gotten me all teary eyed but this did it for me. Fuck blaming onions and shit. I'm a soldier and man enough to admit that it's human nature to cry. Cosby has an iron spine. You know something though?  If the tables were turned and the girl's mother had called Cosby she'd be labeled a creepy celebrity stalker. Something y'all may not have known about capital punishment in the US is that it's far more expensive to execute someone than to imprison someone for life. When I did a research paper on the subject a few years ago I found that it costs around $14 million to put someone through death row and finally execute them. Life imprisonment costs a little over ten grand per year per convict. Of course there are better reasons to be opposed to state-sanctioned murder than its relative cost but I have heard a lot of people claim naively that it's cheaper for the judicial system to blow someone's brains out than to lock them up.What a class act. This guy makes me proud to be Black (among many others as well).TIL Bill Closby's son was shot and killedAnyone remember Gradual_BillCosby? I miss that dudeRespect.I like how he is described as a comedian/pudding company shillWhen it comes to permanent punishments it is no longer about the criminal or the crime. It is about society.\s\sIt really doesnt matter what a perp does. Kills and rapes children. I dont care. Sure he is more than abhorrent but it doesnt matter. It isnt about him and what he did.\s\sI think that is the mistake most people make. They want to make it about revenge. It isnt. It is about removing them from society. If it was about revenge we would tie them down and let the family members of the victims have their way. In the end I doubt they would get the relief that they were seeking.\s\s\sThis is one of many reasons why I am against the death penalty. And I refuse to debate the issue based on hypothetical crimes. IT doesnt matter. IT ISNT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT REVENGE. It isnt about the perp and what he did it is about US and who we are. Being the good guys can be painful at times being the bad guy tends to be easier. But you cant let a bad guy goad you into being like him. Then he is back in control again. It is he who is forcing your actions.\s\sFuck that. I dont kill. Even those who do kill. If it is at all possible to avoid. If they are locked up you can avoid it.\sBill Cosby is a better man that I could be in that situation. I'm sorry but that's just stupid. This man KILLED your son and you want your tax dollars to pay for the rest of his life? And you want the man who killed your son to live? That's just ridiculous.because he would rather the guy rot in jail and get raped anally for the rest of his lifeThe thing about revenge is that you often sink just as low or lower than your enemy in your course for vengeance. Good for him to not succumb to that temptation. Not sure how I would react if a loved one was murdered not do I ever wanna find out.People who are truly and sincerely against the death penalty should be against it in all circumstances with no exceptions. Why? Because if you can come up with scenarios where you agree with the death penalty then you are not against it.\sCould someone come up with a hypothetical situation where a criminals transgressions were so outrageously egregious that almost anyone would feel they should be killed? Perhaps. But genocidal maniacs aside if you are against the death penalty then you are against it in every situation.\sPersonally I am not against the idea of the death penalty but I think that since DNA has cleared a large number of people originally sentenced to die we should probably put a hold on executions until we can be as reliable as we expect others to be.I am against it in every situation anyone who has thought it through to a reasonable degree would be.\s\sWhat I can't understand is people like yourself who somehow feel like murdering someone regardless of what they have done is the path to the sort of society we all want to live in. That this helps the human condition. That is one of the saddest things I know.I'm saddened that [GradualCosby](http://www.reddit.com/user/gradualcosby) hasn't shown up in this thread yet :(I think murders and rapist should do save labor I have thought this as well.\s\sIf they hurt society they should have to pay their debt by improving society in some way.\s\sPicking up litter and clearing brush is a good start but I'm sure there are jobs that no one else wants to do we can put them to work at. The kid who ""shot"" him was actually my friends cousin. Its a bit too late for me to preach that he didnt do it[deleted]Yeah I'm sure that was entirely logistically possible given that the murderer was in police custody.I read the whole article and I have to say I'm impressed on his comments on blacks. That took a lot of course because he wasn't just taking a side in his own life he was taking a stance on an entire ethnicity. And I will admit I don't listen to his comedy at most I've watched his show but he has my respect.\sAlso TIL Bill Cosby has children. I honestly didn't know.You really should check out some of his stuff.

The whole thing was so tragic. If he had gotten the electric chair Bill Cosby would be like ""Bip bop boopity zap.""Man that is just not zip zop not zoobity bop at all.Goddamn. This didn‚Äôt age well. Funny how much can change in 9y.Bill Cosby should be president of the united states. I'd trust him more than most people out there.Executive summary: Pudding industry shillI haven't read all the posts but has anyone corrected the OP's syntax?  ""His own son"" refers to the last subject ""the guy"".  So the way it is posted makes it sound like ""the guy shot and killed his own son"".  I know ticky tack but that's how motherfuckers be on reddit.Loved how he didn't let pride stop him from pointing out the flaws of people who are of the same race as him.This reminds me of the [amish school shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish_school_shooting#Amish_community_response) where the whole community forgave the man who killed 5 little girls. Amish are hardcore about forgiveness.I am amazed and humbled by reading this.  There is a strength in the Amish I can't even start to get my head around.  Thanks for posting that.>After I Spy ended Cosby starred as a gym teacher in his first sitcom The Bill Cosby Show then hosted his own The New Bill Cosby Show variety hour and later a sketch comedy show called Cos.\s\sWow TIL. I grew up watching Fat Albert and The Cosby Show (not to mention listen to his standup) and I knew about I Spy but all these other shows were news to me. But what would be worse? Death or spending the rest of your life in prison and having every hope of getting out crushed and shot down by the system.I am for the death penalty. Why should society pay for a murderer to sit in prison for the rest of his life? The prisons are filled to the brim. I say death penalty and be done with it. Next. How about dont murder someone changing their tire on the side of the road and you society won't be forced to make these decisions for you.It costs more to execute somebody than it does to sentence them life in prison.I think he didn't want him to get the death penalty so he could actually think about what he's done. And his way of making him suffer. Probably thought that death was too good for him. Smart.> Probably thought that death was too good for him. Smart.\s\sLearn more about Bill Cosby and you'll find that nothing could be further from the truth.I haven't read all of the comments so forgive me if this was said already but isn't it possible that he was not coming from a place of forgiveness but instead wanted the man to live with his guilt instead of getting off the easy way?Wow.  So much respect for Bill Cosby.  I wonder how many people in the same situation as him have changed from either side of the fence.  People are remarkable concerning the choices they make sometimes[deleted]Aw poor murderer his life is hard :(You are so right. \s\sIt would have been way classier if Cosby bought him an Xbox and a 65"" LCD TV.You're either opposed to the death penalty or you're not.Poor Theo :(TIL that the pin he wore on the Cosby Show in the early 90's was not for Ennis (who was still alive at that time) but for Sammy Davis JR who had just died.TIL that people are surprised that some people are against the death penalty and aren't hypocrites.Bill Cosby is a symbol of forgiveness for me.\s\shttp://www.cnn.com/2012/04/15/us/bill-cosby-trayvon-martin/index.html?iref=allsearch\s\she overlooks racism completely in this interview.

It makes me sad that he's looking so rough. :( He's also famous for telling black college students to stop blaming white people for their laziness and start blaming themselves for their lack of work ethic.\s\sThe man is amazing.what's with his eye?Wow thanks so much for the link. The amount of ""not-jumping-to-conclusions"" clear thought Cosby put into this astounded me. And I think he's spot on. \s\sWhile I don't think making guns illegal is the answer I do think guns are the problem. A **HUGE** problem when it comes to crime in general‚Äîbe it by ""the bad guys"" or ""the good guys"" (AKA the police). Because it all boils down to the state of mind that having a gun puts you in. You have power and you have control over someone's actions and their life. And power often clouds judgement and rational thought.\s\sIf there are two things that I think need **MUCH** stricter restrictions regulations and scrutiny it's guns and alcohol. And it all boils down to the same reasons.I have a lot of respect for this manDeath is an easy escape from life in prison. Then again that would be a waste of resources.Principle'dWeird shit about his Son death:  I use to go to a church as a teen and 2 weeks before his son death the pastor was making an example of Cosby's Son dying like God's Son Jesus.

Make it your priority one! Similarly Chris Paul forgave the boys who murdered his grandfather and would have chose lesser sentences for them. \shttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=6436820\s\sAlright I was undecided on this issue for a while because there are so many valid points on both sides. For example one could argue that life in prison is merely a death sentence over time and that it is actually more cruel. Then there's the issue of the death penalty costing more. Then you have repeat offenders etc. It goes on and on. But I've came to a final conclusion. If someone is convicted of a crime that warrants the death penalty or life in prison let's let them choose. This would give them a chance to redeem themselves by trying to make up for their mistakes or let them avoid a slow death. Also since it was their choice the probability of an innocent getting the death penalty wouldn't matter. It would get rid of the legal costs of the death penalty. So I think this is the best possible way to deal with this.Thats why he always seems so jolly cuz he knows that assfuck of a human is rotting in jail instead of getting the easy way outTIL Bill Cosby had a mistressWow I imagine that took some incredible integrity.I came here looking for Cosby jokes......If you want things done right....http://drecosby.ytmnd.com/I like that they list his '74 mistress but not any othersThe murder happened on the street I took to get to school as a child - I was in 7th grade when it happened.

You act like all of the royal wealth is 'on the books'. Exactly.  Someone gets it.It's a shame that the richest author of all time isn't even a top 100 author of all time.That's not a shame so much as its a reflection of her actual readership versus the amount of her wealth and fame that's come from licensing her characters to adaptation and merchandising.She's not in the top 100 authors for good reason. Just because her books are entertaining and popular doesn't make them good literature.Technically most of the Queen of Englands wealth cannot be measured (value of crown jewels Buckingham Palace ect.). In pure liquid funds J.K. Rowling wins.\sshe is also a robo-babe.Soley from writing? Doing this without including movie revenue is quite impressive. She's probably still a billionaire when you include that money.She is very rich but I call bs on being 'richer than the Queen of England'.Rowling Oprah and The Queen tend to switch off for world's wealthiest woman. However J.K. Rowling knocked herself off the 2012 Forbes billionaire list by giving away [$160 million to charity last year.](http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/jk-rowlings-charity-giving-knocks-her-off-forbes-billionaires-list)Actually she's given so much money to charity she lost her billionaire status and is now only a millionaire. I wish I had that problem.Pretty impressive considering the fact she use to be homeless. but the real money came from the movies....Oh THAT J.K. Rowling...I'm glad you clarified.today you read.\sShe deserves it because god damn those books make sense! I watched it today and EVERYTHING comes back full circle. EVERYTHINGI never cared for the movies but I did like the books though! Do we really have to clarify that she wrote Harry Potter?wasn't she homeless before she wrote the books too?Well deserved!Harry Potter is one of the very few fantasy series I really dislike. But hey good for her I guess.Can you really say it's solely from writing when she makes money off of the film adaptations?thus proving the pen is mightier than the sworddoes the Queen carry a sword? If the book publishers knew that the Harry Potter books would be so successful they would have negotiated better in their favor.To me JK is Queen of England. People adore her regardless of whether you've read the books or not. She should be knighted (can women be knighted?).If Stephenie Meyer ever becomes a billionaire I'll seriously contemplate suicide.Nobody is wealthier than the Queen of England. JK may have more cash sitting in her disclosed bank accounts but in terms of asset values the Queen blows everyone else on the planet out of the water. Don't forget that she OWNS Australia and Canada. As family heirlooms go they're pretty much as good as it gets. \s\s""Queen Elizabeth II head of state of the United Kingdom and of 31 other states and territories is the legal owner of about 6600 million acres of land one sixth of the earth‚Äôs non ocean surface.\s\sShe is the only person on earth who owns whole countries and who owns countries that are not her own domestic territory.

It'll become a thing that only the wealthy can do if it is.  Her books are amazing though.That is utterly insane. It made her so much money precisely *because* it was good art priced cheaply. Today *I* learned that Rowling rhymes with ""bowling"" not ""howling""She didn't make her money solely through writing. unless every movie and piece of harry potter memorabilia ever sold gave her no money whatsoever.Good for her.  She spent years of her career with disappointments and failures.  It's a credit to her persistence really.http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/03/09/j-k-rowling-no-longer-a-billionaire/Well...writing and MERCHANDISING MERCHANDISING MERCHANDISINGI thought I heard no one is richer than Queen of England because she possesses so much jeweleries that are priceless. I don't know. *Thank god you told me who this J. K. Rowling person is otherwise I would have been completely confused.*The monarchy isn't hugely wealthy quite a lot of people are richer than the queen. simon cowell is something like 20x richer than the british monarchybullshit. the queen is worth trillions. the crown estate technically includes all the land in canada and australia.Cash on hand. Canada and Australia cannot be considered cash liquid assets.Writing ALONE? that's nuts. ""Writing""It makes me sad that many amazing authors died practically dirt poor while Rowling had made over a billion. Not that her writing is bad or anything but writers like Fitzgerald sure deserved a lot more respect.As much as I love Fitzgerald and The Great Gatsby that's a poor example.  Fitzgerald got sidetracked by booze and parties didn't write full novels and passed by on short stories to newspapers then got in a hole he couldn't escape.  It's sad and he didn't deserve it of course but it's not like he didn't have the chance to be rich because he sure as hell did. Respect unfortunately is not currency.She made movies too...She didn't become a billionaire solely through writing...Since the movies are all based on her writing and she didn't direct any of them it's just considered another royalty payed for her books.Queen of England? Fuck... Wales Scotland N.Ireland Southern Island etc etc have suddenly become emancipated? ;) Its not like the movies helped or anything.Lol I always subscribed to the theory that the whole harry potter series were the hallucinations of a child as he starved to death under his abusive uncles' stairs.I actually think she should be richer than just $1 billion. She's sold 450 million books shouldn't she have gotten at least a few bucks per sale?Those publishers take a big cut of that.Generally about 10% of the (domestic) hardcover price up to 20% if you've got a kick-ass contract/ lawyer. Then between 6-8% on paperback sales. Again domestic. International deals are usually flat-rate unless they're worked out by your domestic publisher in which case you're lucky to get anything but if you do it will be (max) half what they get... so not much.\s\sSo generally about 2 bucks/pounds/whatever per hardcover and 30 cents or so per paperback.Licensing of the materiall from her books not from sales of the books themselves.well she only got thet licensing money because the books sold so wellTIL we (New Zealand) should stop being in the commonwealth and start being in the Rowlingwealth. Solve all our problems.Doesn't the LOTR phenomenon have a lot more to do with the NZ economy these days than anything Potter related?Atleast we know now that she's straight.. [deleted]But *she* didn't direct or act in them. She only wrote the story. \s\sEdit: I don't actually care. I just wanted to be a pedantic ass. [deleted]J.K Rowling has been wealthier than the Queen for quite some time now. I believe it was after her 4th book came out. The Goblet of fire. That's when she became wealthier than the Queen.\s\sThis is really old new no idea how it got to the front page. Still interesting though I guess. Well the movies are based on her writings. So I'd say however you qualify the income if it's derivative of the books it's fair to say the books did it.http://www.forbes.com/maserati/billionaires2004/cx_jw_0226rowlingbill04.htmlDon't forget the toys! Yea her book sales alone most likely didn't net her one billion remember her agent gets 15% of it too. Stephen King sold almost as many books as her made many more movies but he also started in the 70's and was paid less he is worth $400 million but he never had a big merchandise book also idk the numbers but Harry Potter is  huge on DVD I'm sure a lot more people received copies of Harry Potter movies for Christmas over say Cujo or the Shinning.Came here to say this thank you. Yes but I think this is quite common with any great accumulation of wealth. Even Charles Dickens who became quite wealthy ""from his books"" also did a lot of merchandising. She only owns editorial rights. Once she said 'yes' to the film she had a one off payment and that's it.Counting Merchandise J. K. Rowling wins. But if the only counting factor were to be book sales Danielle Steel would most likely win with her 800 million books sold to Rowling's 400 million.Did she become a billionaire before the movies were made because I'm pretty sure she made quite a bit of money for helping guide the direction of the movies.She would have made money from selling the permission/getting a cut of the profits.She didn't really guide the direction of the movies (per se... Directors guide the direction of a movie). Authors get money from movies through license grants. They aren't employed or paid a salary by the production company or anything like that. Not all authors necessarily have the foresight to be saying what should or shouldn't be in a film the two skill-sets (writing and film-making) aren't related and you can be good at one and terrible at the other.might be a little late but she didnt make a billion dollars from purely writing.  What about all the merchandise and shit she sold...its amazing how much false information people provideGood for her!Well deserved.imagination!She deserves every penny.She is also no longer a billionaire having given a HUGE amount of her money to charity... LIKE A BOSS!She was in [welfare](http://www.biography.com/people/jk-rowling-40998) in one point. Things like that tend to change your perspective on life. Isn't Charity dead?Charity? Is that the stripper you keep emailing me about?I was always talking shit about JK Rowling like how she obviously just rounded up all fantasy stuff made it kiddie and sold it off. And how she gave nothing back.\s\sThen she donated Billions in Charity.\s\sI then stopped talking shit for all time.\sHow much did she donate and to which charity?I think the movies and the plastic wands helped.I'd hit that...wrong the queen of england owns all of canadaShe's properly called the Queen of Canada here.[deleted]When I was in middle school this lady wasn't even around.DAMN YOU MUGGLES! LOVING YOUR $the queen owns trillions and trillions and trillions she owns whole countries you lease the land-from the crown for your life you never own it- it always is always still goes back-  \s\sthe queen is the largest land owner on the planet.... \swhat is a billion dollars when you own countries like canada australia new-zealand seriously billionaires lol lmao \s\sshe is hot for a british woman better then most j.k is hotty fer her age She's done well in writing one of the most popular book series ever but I don't like it when people praise her for her originality. If anyone has read the Earthsea books by Ursula Le Guin they have practically exactly the same plot and were written 40 years earlier.\sPopular..yes. Original..not at all.\sBut she gives to charity so fuck it.The Queen of England OWNS the land of all commonwealth nations (think Canada Australia Nigeria etc.) something like 6.6 billion acres. That's got to be worth something...Not Nigeria as it's a republic.Don't publishing companies usually make all the money?  How did she do it?What about the guy who wrote the bible? He must be pretty rich because there are a lot of bibles sold.She became rich because she was very careful who she licensed to. If I remember correctly the breaking of the deal was she kept a good percentage of all profits. Not revenue.Well she worked a lot harder for her money than the Queen ever did.\s~~It just got republican up in this biznitch.~~ I actually believe she is no longer a billionaire due to giving most of her fortune away to charity correct me if I'm wrong?She was richer than the queen ages ago and has since given most of her money away. Um she made all that money from the royalties of movies toys etc. too of course. Not solely through writing. (Just saying!)> now wealthier than the Queen of England\s\sShe's been wealthier than the Queen for like 5 years. I remember it was all around the news when it was announced or whatever....solely through writing licensing and merchandise deals.\s\sFTFY\sHow are her other books?Proud to say I haven't given her any of my money.Story aside her writing style is truly amazing.  She has a way of capturing an audience far wider than any one genre and the character development was better than so many other books I've read.  Following in the footsteps of legends. Jack London was the first millionaire writer. Solely through writing but there is no inclusion of movie deal money or did she sell 100 million books?400 million actually.Chipping Sodbury?  ***CHIPPING SODBURY?*** As an ignorant American I revel in the amount of British that is contained in the name of this town.this is a very old fact She also called herself J K Rowling so people would not know she is a woman which would likely have affected sales. \s\sBet you her ex husband has been facepalming for a few decades now.TIL J.K. Rowling wrote the Harry Potter books.\s\s(come on man.)J.K Rowling responsible for an entire generation's literacy. [removed]This is true of every fantasy or sci-fi author. Seems a bit unfair of you to single out JK.Doesn't the queen technically own all the land in Britain?[deleted]The [Royal Collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Collection) alone is worth over ¬£10 billion (if one could even attach a price tag to such items). That being said it's really owned by the state more so than the monarch personally so it wouldn't factor into measures of her personal wealth.Came here to say this.. and pretty far down the comments.\s\sFor example the largest and forth largest diamonds in the world belong to the queen.\shttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullinan_Diamond\s\sShe owns a few palaces a few islands here and there shit ton of land everywhere bunch of priceless paintings and on and on.[deleted][deleted]Do you mean Queen the band?Man she a god damn inspiration to be a good writer. Hope she gets to see that.does this take into account all the land that the Queen of England owns?She doesn't make a penny from it though and doesn't have the ability to sell it.Odd that it lists her nationality as England and not UK or GB.Her books are terrible also!She may be wealthier than Elizabeth Windsor Queen of England but she doesn't have more money than the Crown.It's also worth noting that she pays her taxes rather than being a tax exile.\s\sI'd give a source but unfortunately it's from The Times which is behind a paywall so [here's](http://mgalligan.com/post/7048192908/taxation) a quote from the article.Because of taxes and charity she is actually a millionaire now. [Source](http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/03/09/j-k-rowling-no-longer-a-billionaire/)you seem british...can you explain how the queen's wealth is calculated? because doesn't she ""own"" all of the UK plus all of the castles art work jewelry and various other assets? That's got to be in tens of billions of pounds right?\s\sAlso how do you feel about the institution of the monarchy? It seems a little outdated and unfair to meThat was a little while ago actually. Recently tax and large charity donations have just taken her of the billionaires list of which there are very few women on.i seriously doubt thatShe's going to burn in hell that devil writing. Warlock lover. [deleted]""Solely through writing"" is MEGA debatable. The Queen of England spreads her assets through many properties.  It's kind of stupid to amass wealth under your name instead of a business in today's world.  Didnt she give it all away a few months ago?Not all. A fair portion but she'd probably make that back ""eventually"".That can't be true.... I torrented some of her books so she must be poor now.Regardless of what you think of her writing that's fucking impressive. She has been wealthier than our gracious maj for a couple of years now. I would argue that her money is from licensing deals and not from writing.  Her writing paycheck must be nice and fat but the Hollywood monies and toy sales and other merch is where the big bucks came from.  I'd wager.More like 10% writing 90% merchandisingIf you were a writer and made 90% of your income from people wanting to use your material I'd say she's doing the author thing right.I really wish the OP had bothered to phrase it this way because she's absolutely *not* the top selling author of all time or anything not by a long shot.  The vast majority of her wealth comes through Warner Bros and various other adaptation and merchandising deals.  Saying she made the entire fortune through ""writing"" would be like saying George Lucas built Lucasfilm on the success of his screenplay for THX-1138.""(author of the Harry Potter books)"" Like we don't know that.it's not solely from writing....she got a bunch of money from the movies.Old news but still. the fact that she's the most popular writer in the world is really something to marvel at. I love JK Rowling to freaking death. POTTERHEADS RULEExcept she didnt. Movies and stuff.She deserves it. The world she made is unbelievably brilliant. Its going to inspire a generationThe story is older than hitlerAmazing and i understand she was suicidal when she started and her books werent popular yet. I hope GRRM gets to a billion as welland by ""solely through writing"" you of course mean movies toys and all other aspects of the franchise?naw you got the concept of rich and wealthy fucked up.\s\sThe queen is **wealthy** shes got money and assets to back it up she will never become 'broke' unless some freak shit happens in Britain and shes beheaded.\s\sJK Rowlings while a billionaire is still only rich\s\sRich and wealthy theres a big difference.wow...and she did it in the age of internet pirates...Since Widsors house colors are purple was it scylartology money?Solely through writing... so you're saying that the movies and countless Potter based products haven't been profitable?  I bet you half of the revenue she takes in is from the merchandising of all the Harry Potter stuff. 1% bitch.  Let's take her money and give it to lazy people.I just want to tell you guys while I'm drunk that she deserved this. Good for her.I also read that she is the first person to go from billionaire to millionaire because of donations. I though Charles Schultz was a billionaire too..but I guess he drew alsosomeone told me she used ghost writers to help out with the later books anyone know if there is any truth to that?TIL it is Rowling rhymes with bowling NOT howling.The publishers who printed these books are probably richer than her from her own books :|Yeah but J. K. Rowling can't declare war.[deleted]http://www.magespace.net/mugrev.html\s\s> Note: In interviews and news stories about the Stouffer lawsuit both Stouffer and her representatives have been rather evasive possibly unintentionally regarding the actual content of The Legend of Rah and the Muggles: specifically the existence of characters named Larry and Lilly Potter. **Larry and Lilly Potter do not appear in this book.** They are characters in a series of short  activity books written by Stouffer which will be republished later this year. \s\sThe link above also summarizes the chapters of The legend of Rah and the muggles. Basically there are no similarities between Rah and HP whatsoever.  \s\sAlso please. The similarities between Orson Scott Card and J.K Rowling's books are so vague and are basically archetypal fantasy/sci-fi stuff. If he really thinks that Rowling was borrowing from his book he needs to get his head out of his ass. I really hope the people downvoting you have a better reason than a knee jerk reaction to protect Rowling. If Harry Potter is a rip off it should be known.I always thought Stephen King was the first billionaire solely through writing. Oh well‚Ä¶. (shrugs)To be fair the Queen does own you know the United Kingdom.well those books are pretty fuckin good.Agreed!I hated the one I tried to read. But I think I am older than the target audience. \s\s\sI loved the movies though.Overrated but still good.Yeah like I don't really care for HP but I can easily recognize how great the whole series is. Back when it was new it sure fascinated me. I think what she did for children (and everyone else who's a fan LOL) with her crazy imagination is nothing short of hyper respectable.I always hear this ""wealthier than the Queen"" but I cant really imagine it's true. Maybe in straight up money but the royal families wealth is vast. The amount of land and castles etc would be worth hundreds of millions if not billions and then there's all the priceless da vinci/orther works of art they own. I haven't even gotten to the gold and jewellery...\sI just really cant imagine that 1 or 2 billion dollars make you wealthier then the Queen. The articles short little biography on her mentions ""Sexual orientation: Straight"" lol and thats important how?I'd fairly certain she was richer than the Queen before the movies even started. I may be wrong but I heard this state awhile ago she does well for herself. Great lady.TIL some people still need to explain who JK Rowling is.J.K. Rowling in dough!No she isn't.  The Queen technically owns all the land in England and thus owns everything built upon it all businesses and all people under her rule.  England is still a Kingship even though it is looked at mainly as a Democracy these days.I'd really hate to be the publishers that turned her down. Talk about feeling like a moron.Did she get a billion just from her books? Cool if so but I doubt really true. Figure a large sum of that was residuals from the movies and merchandise.Um I'm pretty sure she doesn't have more money than the Queen of England.  I would imagine Royal Family's Assets comes out to more than 100000's of billions of dollars.  None of which she can sell or make money from since she has agreements with governments all over the world.""solely through writing."" i'm sure the movies had something to do with that.SOCIALISIZUMANIMAGICWORD!Please someone tell me: why do you all give a shit?Why does anyone care about anything on reddit really? Interesting things are interesting.Am I the only one in the targeted age group that didn't like these books?\s\sI mean the first one came out when I was like 7 or 8 and I tried reading it in middle school but I just found it boring.I found them terribly boring in middle school and early high school when I tried reading them.  I think I was in the mindset also that they were childrens books and not worth my time.  I decided to give them a chance about 3-4 years ago (When I was 20 I think) and blew through all of them in a summer.\s\sI have read the series twice now and am rereading the books in German to beef up my language skills.  I HIGHLY recommend reading the books in a foreign language for language study.  Very diverse yet simple writing.Amazing when you consider she wrote the first HP book while on welfareDeserves every penny.My childhood would've been much more boring without her writings. Well deserved now just make sure to give some to those in need.JK Rowling is well known for her charitable acts.  She has written several books for the benefit of Comic Relief UK organizes many charity events and donates a large percentage of her royalties to different children's charities.  A woman who had to live in poverty as long as she did isn't going to forget about those in need.She was richer than the Queen *years* ago.Yeah it always annoys me to find TIL posts on the front page that I learned about 5 years ago. I guess this sub isn't named r/todaybreakfastnazilearned though so I shouldn't complain. Does the Queen of England have to pay for anything? Ever?Just the Comcast bill.  Nobody escapes that.The royal family owned a bunch of land that they lease to the UK for free. The income from that land to the UK more than pays their allowances and budgets let alone tourist income from watching the fellas in bearskins walk about. She likely doesn't know what a sterling note looks like even though it has her face on it.Yes. i don't have the source but i do recall reading an article when i was visiting my dad in UK a few years ago. she was going to parliament to access for an increase in her yearly allowance arguing that what she has is not enough to maintain her household - pay staff etc etcFirst person.. is there anyone else who has also become a billionaire through writing?Code?  Yes.Rhymes with ""bowling"" or ""howling"" which don't rhyme which each other. It's either an ""oh"" sound of an ""ow"" sound make up your mind. Solely through writing... *and black magic* you mean. Nationality: England\s\sHunh?the second person will probably be that ~~genius~~ that wrote teenage girl vampire porn....err twilightActually she is no longer classified as a billionaire due to the massive amounts she has donated to charities. \sWhich makes her the best millionaire ever. Man just so so so successful.  Kudos to J.K. Rowling.\s\sNow if my wife's book could just get a tiny fraction of that sort of success!!!   :-)  \s\s\s(Well I guess technically it already has a ""tiny fraction"" but it would be nice if the fraction could get a little less ""tiny"")\s\sWhat's the book?  Sell me on it.If nobody else is going to ask then I will.\s\s\sWhat is your wife's book? And goddamn she very well deserved that wealth! Can you imagine if her writing never made it to the level of success it is now?TIL that JK Rowling's father was an engineer for Rolls-RoyceAs a person who's fantasy job would be an author she's an idol.""solely through writing""? I am not sure that selling movie rights is just writing.Why was the first books title changed for US?\s\sPhilosopher's Stone vs Sorcerer's Stone wth?I kinda become a bookworm because of this books I grew up with them (I'm 18) and they definitely boosted my book-love since I've been a reader forever (I started reading when I was 10 years old approx). When you read you can trully see the world in a different and wonderful new way.\s\sJ.K Rowling deserves every penny she has.I agree with you. I'm 22 now so I was slightly older than you when they all came out but I remember reading the first 2 and waiting eagerly for all the others. Pre-ordered every one. I was always into books anyway but it felt really nice to be able to enjoy a book that was so popular. It was totally okay to admit you absolutely adore reading.\s\sJ.K Rowling did a fabulous thing for childrens literature everywhere. There must be so many people who feel the same as me (grateful that her books helped thrust reading into the 'cool' limelight) and even more like you for whom her books started off a really great hobby.I don't understand why anyone would downvote this. It makes my lost faith in humanity slightly less severe knowing there's people like you out there that still take time to read.\s\sedit: inb4 'must be a teacher' why yes yes I am.I'm more interested in that website's logo...She also gave a large chunk of her fortune in charitable donations and by paying her taxes in full. UK tax rates are insane even by our standards here in Canada and there are many many ways for a very rick UK citizen to avoid paying taxes but she refused to use them. She's probably personally paid for at least a couple of hospitalsSome husband is one lucky son of a gun.The ex husband who left her with a child when she was writing the first book is probably not happy with his decision.I'll be honest that is badassWell deservedSide note from the comments. But I would just like to say I would tap that!Queen Elizabeth II head of state of the United Kingdom and of 31 other states and territories is the legal owner of about 6600 million acres of land one sixth of the earth‚Äôs non ocean surface.\s\sShe is the only person on earth who owns whole countries and who owns countries that are not her own domestic territory. This land ownership is separate from her role as head of state and is different from other monarchies where no such claim is made ‚Äì Norway Belgium Denmark etc.\s\sThe value of her land holding. ¬£17600000000000 (approx).\s\sThis makes her the richest individual on earthNo it doesn't. She won't be able to claim most of that short of an armed rebellion and a very very bloody civil war.Also Harry Potter got turned down for publishing 15 times I believe.I think it was closer to 12 but even that is kind of an exaggeration. It wasn't actual acuqisitions editors reading her book and not liking it I think the initial problem she had was simply the word count--the bigger publishers were turning down the proposal from her literary agency without even having it on hand saying 120000 words for a children's book is unmarketable. \s\sOften when people hear that major bestsellers were originally ""rejected"" they're imagining people at their jobs who can't understand a good thing when they're presented with it when it's often just a formulaic algorithm that is applied before the book is even delivered. If that sounds counterintuitive to finding good books I think it's also important to note that it ends up saving the world from far more *bad* books than it ends up resulting in *good* books being missed if that makes sense. Definitely not ""solely through writing.""Whilst she might have more liquid cash than the queen I hazard she doesn't have as many assets I think the going rate for a castle in good working order is fairly steep.Not being sarcastic but I truly wonder if anyone on Reddit wouldn't have known what JK Rowling was famous for. I tend to think most everyone would know her name and book series. Anyone have a hard time placing her name?I think I can say with certainty as can many other people that Harry Potter influenced my childhood more than any other piece of literature and is still probably the most influential thing I've read.I was a fairly sad and friendless child. The Harry Potter books and a few great teachers were about my only solaces between the ages of 10-14. I remember thinking in junior high that I really didn't see the point in being alive but then I would remember there were still 2 more HP books to be written. Ditto. I've read The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Order of the Phoenix 15+ times as a child (those were my favorites) and the entire series around 8 times. I was going to say how I now feel old but then found out that Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997.So Harry Potter made you an anal_explorer? I knew witchcraft was evil! You're way too young to be exploring anuses.How did it influence your childhood other than being something you were interested in and enjoyed? Did it make you read more were you interested in similar stories?>and is still probably the most influential thing I've read.\s\sThis coming from a person whose screen name is Anal_Explorer. Sure says a lot about the influential writings of Rowling.If Harry Potter is the most influential thing you have read you should probably start reading more. It is pretty interesting and enjoyable but I don't consider it particularly influential but to each his own I guess.\s\sEDIT: didn't mean to start a shitfest. I know a lot of people lotter Harry Potter but if you haven't read books like The Great Gatsby Tender is the Night Frankenstein The Sun Also Rises or A Passage to India you should really give them a shot because they are all fairly fast moving and fantastic reads.Solely through writing...thats just not true. What about ALL those movies!?I want a documentary or TV show episode on how she started the books and how her life changed!!She's not even remotely close to being as wealthy as the Queen of England. Only a fool would believe this.and selling rights to her books\sI'm pretty sure that book sales alone did not make her a billionaire ;pYou don't need to say that J.K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter books. Everyone knows that.Insert slowpoke meme here?I would have sex with J. K. Rowling.  Not because of her writing or because she's filthy rich but because I have a thing for moderately attractive older women.\s\sIn the interest of full disclosure I've never read any of her books.  But I watched the movies.My niggaWell...in that case I'd watch a movie of you having sex with her but I won't read anymore on the subject.Awesome woman :DWriting and condoning awfulful scriptwriting.coulda sworn that nndb was non-nude database. i suppose this *could* be found on there somewhere...What makes it so much more amazing is that before she wrote the books she was a single mother who was living on welfare. Perhaps most admirable of all she didn't let the riches get to her head; she started charities and donated money to those who most needed it. If anyone deserves wealth like that it's her. I still wish she would do a little more with the harry potter universe...what else can we do with our imaginations?Am I the only one who did not read harry Potter Books?Solely through writing? So she didn't make money from the movies or merchandise....?Means she did it right. People out there the ones who do the original creative work they deserve more of the wealth it brings than anyone else involved. But that's not always the case. The ones with the idea often get screwed.I believe the ""k"" isnt part of her name either. She was told that she would sell more copies if she had initials rather than Joanne RowlingThe way she tells it her publishers came to her with a problem: They couldn't put Joanne Rowling because boys wouldn't buy it and they couldn't put J Rowling because it wouldn't look or sound good which even though it seems trivial would supposedly hurt sales a lot. They needed another initial and asked Rowling for one. She chose K after her grandmother.And yet a BDSM novel outsells her in paperback. I don't want to live on this planet anymore. From just writing? Try writing royalties from toys games and the moveis.[deleted]Exactly what I was going to post. Anything that has the name ""Harry Potter"" on it she gets paid for.I love how you put her job description in parenthesis like we don't know herWouldn't it be wrong to say solely through writing? Most of her wealth probably came from royalties from the movies merchandise and the theme park right?The Queen is the world's richest welfare recipient. The queen isn't on the welfare system. shes effectively a landlord and a figure head. in this analogy the UK is an apartment building the the british government is comprised of the management company the queen employes but is staffed by tennents elected by other tennents. She's inspiring. TIL she's also kind of a MILF.everyone knew this years agoSolely through her writing AND selling the rights to her writing in order for movies card games video games dvds blu-ray re-releases etc.>It was the publisher's idea to have her use a gender-neutral pen name as they feared boys wouldn't read a book written by a woman\s\sTIL there may be boys out there who won't read a book simply because of the sex the author happens to be. Sigh.When I read this I was so confused. I just remember reading it and assuming it was a girl. (At the time I assumed all writers were women because my mom is a writer). I never once thought that someone would decide not to read something based on the writer's gender. I was maybe five or six when I started reading these books.Eight-part movie franchise is not exactly ""solely through writing"" although I realize that she had very little to do with actually making them... but even the royalties from it I mean good lord!  Can you imagine?  It's the biggest thing since big things!That's because Harry potter isn't just a bunch of story books. It's become it's own entity; it's own industry. Just like how star wars became a mega industry with its own following and all that from just books/movies. Why re fuck isn't Stephen king a billionaire is don king his agent? His books aren't able to be made into merchandise for little munchkins like harry potter is.I find $400 million to be pretty damn good for an author especially with 49 books writtenShe became richer than the queen a few years ago. The only problem I have with this is that the Harry Potter is series is nothing special just popular.[deleted]She made a huge amount but it's far less than Rowling. Last estimate put Meyer at ~125 million.J. K. Rowling actually wrote her books. Meyer just took a dump on her keyboard.Jesus I feel old when people talk about reading these books when they were children.I wonder if she knows I could use some of that money.I don't think she's that wealthy anymore. Supposedly she's been pretty busy giving a lot of money away. \s>When you're writing children's books says Rowling ""you need to be a ruthless killer"".Why don't more people care about this as much as I do......care about what?I was very good in binge drinking.When i first time heard for this guy I read somwhere that his professors did not take him serious at the first time in college.....he is smart.  Is it... Leonard Hofstadter?I heard he chose the adviser that he did because he didn't want to be known as the ""Feynman student"" or ""Gell-Mann student"". He wanted someone low profile and told this to his prospective advisers...I fucking love this site.

Awesome brainpower!This guy also logged every keystroke he typed since 2002 [and plotted it](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/).Shit that's actually kind of awesome.I wonder how much of that was porn?george constanza is a damn geniusI would say Dr. Wolfram does not really suffer from a deficit in the self-appraisal of his intelligence. \s\sAnyone who opens his book with ""Newton invented Calculus and my book is that good too"" (a [tome](http://www.wolframscience.com/) just shy of 1200 pages discussing random stuff and cellular autonoma that sits precariously on my shelf that - among other things - is my go-to reference for why smart people should not self-publish) is somewhat overstating the facts at hand. \s\sI have every confidence that someday genetic algorithms and ideas based or generated from systems based on computational evolutionary models could in fact change the course of our entire civilization but I think that owes far more to [Mr. Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) [Dr. Holland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Holland)  and [Dr. Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) than to what Dr. Wolfram has done.\s\sDon't get me wrong he's a exactly same kind of jerk as Steve Jobs was and more than a bit of Steve Wozniak (who is reportedly kinda cool) mixed together and his work on [Mathematica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica) & Alpha was/is in fact revolutionary in many respects. Looks sort of like Total Biscuit in the thumbnail. [deleted]My dad is a computer scientist- and to my knowledge one of the only people who's read the book all the way through. I asked him what he thought of it a while ago and he said ""Somewhat interesting but the guy seems like a real dick.""I've heard him interviewed he seems like kind of a jerkWhere's the article that talked about units of smugness being measured in Wolframs?(from The American Scientist review)\s\s""Consider a one-dimensional automaton where the cells have just two possible states (black and white) and where each cell interacts only with its nearest neighbors. There are eight possible configurations of a cell and its two neighbors and for each of these configurations the next state can be either black or white. Hence there are 2^8 possible rules for the evolution of the system. These 256 rules are all the available candidates for laws of nature in this tiny universe.""\s\sYou can't argue with Wolfram there. When it comes to all the possible laws of nature for a tiny universe you can't get much tinier than 1 byte.[rpf thought so too](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/06/you-dont-understand-ordinary-people.html?m=1)I have that book in my office. On the one hand it contains a lot of very good science which is really useful to the field I'm in. On the other hand it's literally 100 times longer than it needs to be and holy shit does Wolfram ever love himself.This is also a great review: http://masi.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/wolfram/\s\sAnd allegedly the working conditions at Wolfram suck: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3y26tf?context=3\sThose were some good reads. Thanks for posting.Seems like I'm the only person here who read the whole book and thinks it's just as absolutely amazing and ground-breaking as he does. I didn't get any kind of egotistical tone from the book just the tone of someone who has put forth an argument very carefully with a shitload of evidence to back it up. Of course he's a nutjob but so was Tesla and Einstein and most other brilliant scientists who've made huge contributions. \s\sThe ideas in the book just make too much sense to me.\s\s\sWhen that book came out he did a guest lecture (on a promo tour) at my university. A bunch of profs from the math dept all but laughed Wolfram off stage during the Q&A portion. It was a blood bath. Still got Wolfram's signature on a first printing. \sThat looks like one big link.Did he program the Wolfram Alpha website code?

Anyone else think that's beyond absurd?Couldn't have been simple possession. That'd be possession with intent to distribute for 1.4 lbs and chances are it was Federal because he was at an airport and I assume he crossed some state lines. Nobody cops 1.4 lbs just to snort it.

This is not the same as usage.  \s\sI know no one that is pro drug trafficking (which is what this is).  Regulating is not equivalent to people pushing it on the streets.

I need to upvote someone who mentions that any sane person would take the 5 years. but EVERY drug? I can't upvote that. Snitches die slowBecause you get into it with these people and you know the consequences before you commit the act. The problem with snitching is GENERALLY if nobody says a fucking word to the cops everyone takes a smaller sentence. There is really no way to say this as sounding racist but this is why you don't commit crimes with white people. Their propensity to snitch is just so much fucking higher it blows my mind. You just found out about the coke?!TIL Tim Allen is a crazy asshole.If only there was a way of spelling out that weird sound he makes on Home Improvement.

I went to go hear her talk and she was unbelievable old fashioned. She talked about how women who dress ""inappropriately"" are ""asking to have sex"" and that if you are already naked in a bed with someone you have already consented to have sex and therefore can not be construed as rape. \s\s... any person anywhere has the right to refuse sex whenever s/he wants. Any person can feel uncomfortable and not want to continue with the situation and they're allowed to say no.

To keep infants quiet in the night she drugged them with paregoric an opium derivative. To keep older slaves from having second thoughts she wielded a revolver and told deserters they would be shot. In a particularly daring move she abducted her own parents in 1857 (it was of course impossible to seek their consent in advance) and brought them to her home in New York.""\s\sHoly shit. HT.

Glad to see this comment as I was going to say this myself. \s\sMy grandpa has some crazy refugee stories and one of them was about giving opium to small children to keep them quiet. Sadly sometimes the children would be given too much opium and had to be left behind. I don't think he ever gave any to my mom though and she was only around 4 or 5 when they were fleeing. He carried her on his back for four days straight and even across a fucking river.

Fox news would have a field day with this one. I can see Hannity frothing at the mouth on this one.Apparently she was not an idiot.  I suspect she learned very quickly that drugging babies was far better than smothering them to keep them quiet in those times when any sound would get them all killed.*waits for Scumbag Harrit Tubman meme*gotta do what you gotta do. it was for the best.\searly exposure to a potentially addictive substance a single time is still better than a life of slavery.I think the addictive potential of opium is overstated. Addiction comes when you smoke the stuff waaaaay too often. One hit isn't going to make your brain spontaneously fiend for opium. Maybe if you had a really addictive personality. I dunno. Going from personal experience and my friends' experiences with it it's not the life-wrecker you hear about.To be fair most small children were doped up on opium 24/7 by their parents in those days.Also this: \sShe carried a gun not just for protection but for 'persuasion'. Sometimes slaves would get scared and want to go back and when they did she threatened to kill them. I also remember hearing there was an especially rickety bridge she had to 'persuade' the fleeing slaves across. Like you guys said Gotta do what you gotta do! I'm sure they were all incredibly grateful in the end.*This is not an option nigga; if you do not get across this bridge we have a problem.*Hey whatever works.that shit crayyy. what a smart ladyMental Floss.Yeah that wasn't a big deal back then at all. I'm pretty sure it was like a warm glass of milkDoesn't matter; became free. thats why i use opium tooThe train ride must've gone by quickly!Yeah. So what?The opium was the least interesting part for me. God damn what a badass. TIL Harriet Tubman was the first drug dealer in america!Uh...no probably not.Republicans believe this is why their descendants are drug addicts!Actually most major drug addicts I know are white especially the heroin addicts.I like stories like these when I'm being an asshole and inform people they can ""never say never"". ""When is it ever okay to give kids drugs? When they won't shut the fuck up whilst you're on the run from slave owners. Der you moron!""\sI hope this isn't trueCompletely understandable if you have ever been around small children.I also doubt it would harm that much. I wouldn't recommend it but apart from the addictive aspect opium doesn't do any long term damage. Or children in general. Or young adults. Or humans.I FUCKING HATE kidsCompletely understandable if you have ever been around anyone from the south.No matter how smart or well-behaved they are there are times where they will just not shut the fuck up. My parents uesd to 'gravol' me for long trips to keep me calm and sleepy.  I'm not sure if I will use this trick on my own children or not but I did do something similar to get my four month old to sleep.  She had a habit of going down for the night around 5am so a friend suggested giving her baby benadryl.  I did it two nights in a row at 10pm and she has been sleeping at that time since without medication.\s\s[Drugs drugs drugs!  Which are good which are bad?!

I took a prescribed amount of morphine once and spent 5 hours running into a wall in Resident Evil 0. Then I fell asleep on the side of the couch and destroyed the nerves in my arm. I have to wonder what giving immeasurable doses of its much less purified ancestor did to children.It freed them?I took 600 mg of morphine the other day and felt nothing.Just wanted to mention that opium was in a lot of medicine back then so it was given to small children for far less serious reasons.\s\s> In the seventeenth century laudanum was recommended for pain sleeplessness and diarrhea by Thomas Sydenham[27] the renowned ""father of English medicine"" or ""English Hippocrates"" to whom is attributed the quote ""Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings none is so universal and so efficacious as opium.""[28] Use of opium as a cure-all was reflected in the formulation of mithridatium described in the 1728 Chambers Cyclopedia which included true opium in the mixture. Subsequently laudanum became the basis of many popular patent medicines of the nineteenth century.\s\s> During the 18th century opium was found to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its sedative and tranquilizing properties it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis help with people that were considered insane and also to help treat patients with insomnia.[29] However despite its medicinal values in these cases it was noted that in cases of psychosis it could cause anger or depression and due to the drugs euphoric effects it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.[29]\s\s> The standard medical use of opium persisted well into the nineteenth century. U.S. president William Henry Harrison was treated with opium in 1841 and in the American Civil War the Union Army used 2.8 million ounces of opium tincture and powder and about 500000 opium pills.[6] During this time of popularity users called opium ""God's Own Medicine.""[30]\s\shttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpiumI read that there are signs in Iran telling parents not to blow opium smoke in their children's faces. Apparently it's an old remedy to sooth coughs and to get them to settle down among other things.Yep. Plenty of references in literature to opium dating back to previous times. It wasn't uncommon to use opium to sedate kids. See ""The Wizard of Oz.""Better than the Hawkeye Pierce approach. Also pretty sure Jews in Nazi occupied places did the same thing.I'm glad the children were saved from the miserable under-ground journey and instead a wonderful world on a puffy cloud of comfort and dazeUpvote for linking to NNDB!Going after rails on a crazy train ! So what you're saying... is that the Government got the idea for giving crack to the black community from Harriet Tubman? \s\sThat has to be the most absurd thing I've ever heard. Good day sir.I believe you mean *Milk of the Poppy*To be honest I prefer Dreamwine[deleted]Well...it workedIt looks bad at first glance but hey drastic times call for drastic measures.Is it possibly because of Charles II of Spain that the apocryphal story of the Castilian lisp developed? \s\sOr rather maybe the [prognathism](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/xdhl5/til_the_the_spanish_monarchy_was_so_inbred_that/c5lire1) that was inherent in the Hapsburg family was repeatedly passed down through the inbreeding of the line going back to Phillip I of Castile until it culminated in the extreme disabilities of Charles II.\s\sSo actually the lisp was possibly of earlier provenience in the family and became more pronounced with successive generations. Then it was adopted through prestige borrowing by courtiers and finally the general populace (I doubt that people would emulate Carlos II out of deference or respect if he could not chew or *speak at all...*).\s\sIf one compares the development of the [*seseo/ceceo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceceo#Castilian_.27lisp.27) ""lisp"" it fairly closely follows the [Hapsburg rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_segundo80.png). \s\sThis might also explain why American Spanish does not lisp- the lisp originated in Spain at some point during the reign of the Hapsburgs and the American varieties of the language speak the earlier original form.\s\sMaybe the myth of the Spanish lisp is plausible after all.http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/slowpoke.jpgLet this be a lesson to morons who think that breeding for 'purity' is the smart thing to do.Joanna of Castille wouldn't let them embalm her dead husband and followed his body across the country. She was crazy too.Wait what was his body up and about for?We don't really know that actually. Her ""crazyness"" could very well been propaganda. Maybe she was just a pretty normal women who was later imprisoned supposedly to protect her from herself.Yup. To this day we call her Juana la Loca ""Joanna the Crazy"".

Not the spanish branch that Charles II was part of either.my AP Euro teacher called him tweety bird because his head was supposed to be huge and his body really tiny.I don't even understand how this works.Not sure if you're talking abut the family designations or the genetics but as someone who studies genetics I can explain why he was so messed up. There is nothing about inbreeding inherently that will make you look funny. Basically there are a lot of traits hidden in our genomes because they are recessive. They don't actually show up in anyone because after years of selection they have been hidden away and for the most part will never be seen again because there are better dominant traits that have overruled them. However when you have inbreeding going on for this long you lose the heterogeneity of the genome that tends to crowd out these traits. Because everyone in your family has similar genomes if you keep mixing only one family together eventually hidden recessive traits that natural selection had put away long ago start cropping up again.Philip IV of Spain married his niece Manana of Austria. Manana's mother and Philip's sister is Maria Anna of Spain. Maria Anna is also the aunty of Charles II. However since *her* daughter is Charles' mother it also makes Maria the grandmother of Charles. The mother of Philip IV and his sister Maria Anna is Margarita of Austria. This makes Margarita Charles' grandmother. However because Margarita is the mother of Maria Anna who is in turn the mother of Manana--Charles' mother--it makes Margarita the great grandmother of Charles.\s\sCheck the diagram posted in [the comment above](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/xdhl5/til_the_the_spanish_monarchy_was_so_inbred_that/c5lf71s).It's like Big Brother... but for many generations.Yeah gotta watch those ""silly fantatic""s.First love second cousin.Targaryens of the real world.He sounds more like Robert Arryn.Weird watched that last night for the first time.So he's so inbred that he is actually a sandwich ""I'm my own grandpa I'm my own grandpa It sounds funny I know but it really is so.

And there are situations where it isn't as bad (physically anyway.

This usually causes bad things like dwarfism mental disorders etc.  But if you and your sibling were separated at birth and you've both been checked for horrible genetic disorders go ahead and fuck your sister.Enter the Game of Thrones House of Borbones ""Pride and satisfaction"".

I am not making fun of the guy it sounds like he had a really hard life but is it possible he was afflicted with this? The description of him makes it sound reasonable to me but perhaps I am missing something.His portraits dont demonstrate any of the physical signs of Down Syndrom. Most likely he was physically weak and abit slow so he was babied his whole life.The Habsburgs had a genetic trait of [Prognathism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognathism) also called ""Habsburg Lips"". Many times you cannot tell due to facial hair but a lot of them had it.Prognathism the troll face of facial diseases. Well one of the popular legends is that Charles V jaw deformity was so bad that he lisped his S and Z when he spoke and that all the other nobles and commoner copied him as not to insult him and that is why Spanish still to this day lisp the s and z while the reset of the Spanish speaking world does not.  \s\sAlso it's rumored that the huge rounded collars popular in fashion at the time was actually a bib the Hapsburgs had to wear because their jaws gave the a propensity to drool.  The rest of the court again wore them to not insult them and it became a fashion.

If you know which way is north (which you should from observing Polaris) You can take a stick (gnomon) at sunrise (or sunset) and tilt it until the shadow is pointing west (or east at sunset). Of course for this to work well you would have to do it at the vernal or autumnal equinox.

I thought his wife said it was an accident though it was more likely suicide.\s\sEdit: She denied it until 5 years after he had died. And in an interview she admitted that he purposefully shot himself but claims no note was left behind.My mother is related to Ernest Hemingway on her fathers side. Her paternal grandfather committed suicide.I learned that my sophomore year of high schoolFive finger cats can work a shotgunIs there a genetic predispostion to suicide? Like what has been established for say alcoholism?Suicide is a symptom more or less of other factors and some of these factors can be genetic. So in a way yes but probably not in the way you are imagining it to be.There is no proof of a genetic predisposition for suicide discovered yet as far as I know but it is widely accepted by psychiaters that suicide does run in families*. There is a genetic predisposition for depression but in some families with this predisposition those depressed do not commit/attempt suicide more often than the average depressed person while in other families almost every one with depression commits suicide. \s\s*my source: the psychiatrists I worked for. I understand that this is a meager source on the internet but it'll have to do for now.apparently he suffered from [Iron Overload](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemochromatosis) or ""Hemochromatosis"".Depression can be genetic.If there is the gene can only survive if it express itself after the host has kids.I knew a man who's father & brother both killed themselves on their 69th birthdays both with pistols. This man thought strongly this was also his destiny. He died at 72 of natural causes but hid away in his home for the last 3 years.Apparently his suicide was linked to the heriditary disease [hemochromatosis](http://celticcurse.org/hemingways-death-and-hemochromatosis-awareness/).I reckon is has something to do with being followed and no one believing him as well.Did no one read the bit about his mother dressing him as a girl and calling him Ernestine until he was 6 years old? I am going to commit suicide if this gets posted one more time...You have all but guaranteed the immediate and frequent re-posting of this for at least the next few weeks. Thanks. r/hemingwaysuicidewatch thats a fucked up family right there.His mom kept him as a girl until he was 6 and demanded to be a boy. WTF?Does anyone know if that Predators quote is real or accurate?  \s\sAnd no I don't have google.Are you in my abnormal psyc class?  The chapters we are studying now mentioned this.Many suspect a genetic difficulty in processing iron - which leads to mental issues. Hemingway committed suicide in part because he was being surveilled by the FBI but no one believed him and the FBI lied and said they were not. He was put in a mental institution and given electro shock therapy for his ""delusional"" beliefs of being followed.Go on...As a person whose father committed suicide I wonder if it will catch me too. I'm pretty happy with my life right now and I would never want to cause my family the pain he caused me..Sometimes I wonder if it's a defect in the brain something that is destined to happen..weird.Only if you make the same mistakes as he does.\sSuicide in itself is not hereditary only the depression that causes it. \sThe fact that you know this should make you very aware that you are predisposed to depression and not being able to cope with it so when you find yourself depressed you should really do something about it before you become REALLY depressedMy grandfather killed himself mom attempted and I've had serious thoughts before getting help. It's funny we all are well liked happy on the outside people.\s\sOn the other side I've got 2 suicides. But those were due in part to alcoholism.\s\sMy mental health is fucked. A ton of the characters in his stories killed themselves too.Mass suicide is never good. Fun fact: My mother lived next to him in Key West back in 1960... she was very young but the only thing she could remember is ""he had a lot of cats""Hemingway may have had a condition called hemochromatosis which made him depressed. Hemochromatosis is where your body has too much iron in your blood and it begins to deposit in your organs causing diabetes cardiomyopathy kidney failure arthritis and cirhosis.  Hemingway's fathermay have also had this same condition.Depression is a hell of a disease.After finding out that her husband Ted Hughes had impregnated his mistress (with whom he was living at the time) Sylvia Plath killed herself by sticking her head in the oven. She left their two children locked in their bedroom lining their door with towels so the gas wouldn't seep in. Ted Hughes' mistress also killed herself and their daughter over a pile of Plath's manuscripts and Hughes' and Plath's son killed himself as well. I believe Hem was bipolar as well. That is believed to run in families.He was a member of the Lost Generation pretty sure most of them committed suicideHmm not really. Fitzgerald Eliot Steinbeck Dos Passos Stein Sherwood Anderson all died natural deaths. Erich Remarque did die in WWI and Zelda Fitzgerald died during a fire in a sanitarium though neither of those would be suicides either. Hemingway is pretty much the only artist from that loose group to have committed suicide.[""Isn't life pretty?"" Ernest Hemingway once said and then he put a bullet through his head.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPKEk2aHjow)To be fair to the guy though. He survived car accidents  consecutive plane crashes divorces loneliness and electro shock therapy many many times. That's enough to make anyone to seriously contemplate suicide.And he was an ambulance driver in WW1. Many of his stories reflect that period of his life if you want to get some idea of how it was.

By the 1950s he was disenchanted with the quality and commercial control of television describing it as ""a way for people to waste a lot of their lives"" and forbidding its use in his own household.""\sThe real question is if someone else would have invented it sooner would his 14 year old self had been the same genius? Would he have been just as brilliant if there was a TV when he was a kid?He invented a type of nuclear fusion reactor as well.at first his thumbnail struck me as a young willem dafoe grafted with young marlon brando's chin.I get confused here. The first television broadcast was in 1925 in London by John Logie Baird. Is the distinction purely between one being analogue and another being electronic?Baird invented a mechanical television which was the first overall of the technology. Farnsworth inspired by Baird's invention got created a completely electronic version of Bairds mechanica spining disc Television. The distinction may seem like a minor one on the surface but it's actually quite important because it was Farnsorth's electronic television that came be the basis for the medium going forward. Unlike Tesla and Edison Baird and Farnsworth became friends and visited each-others labs.  \s\s[I can't be the only one who thought this](http://i2.listal.com/image/484173/500full.jpg)I am a descendant of Philo T.

My stepfather says he worked for him when he (stepfather) was in high school in Idaho. Not saying that he told me about the plowing thing. He talked more about how disappointed he was at what became of TV because they had a different vision in those days. Planned Parenthood could use that donation.So she proved she's not a smart liberal?  PETA kills animals.There are a few layers of weird here. First of all even though Chrissie Hynde is credited as the sole songwriter the bassline that was used was composed by Tony Butler so she gets to claim credit not really due to her (side note I have no idea why The Pretenders had this arrangement not to share credit equally). Also if you read the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_City_Was_Gone) about this song you see that ""she said her parents loved and listened to Rush and she did not mind its use"" and it was actually the record label that wanted the usage fee.I can't remember where i heard it right now(may not be 100% true) but she said her parents listen and she doesn't care who uses her music. Never heard about this royalty business. My dislike for PETA is only slightly below that of Rush. Positive outcome IMO.ACLU and or DNC would have been much more satisfying. PETA is even worse than Rush. :( Why would you donate money to an organization that hates and kills animals? Dumb bitch.I was almost glad that someone stuck it to Rush until that whole PETA part now I hate BOTH of them.You should listen to Rush.  Dont lie you never have. PETA? WHYYY. It could have gone to support Occupy Protests. That would have pissed Limbaugh off to no end. ""A-O WAY TO GO OHIO"" was a reference to Bush carrying the swingstate? Hate Limbaugh but it's kinda clever. Do you mean the first Bush? Because Rush was using that as his theme song wayy before 2000.The song's title says it all.  She went back to Ohio and her home was gone.  Paved over.  I think the built a mall where her house used to be.\s\sOh look Wikipedia has the info "" the lyrics take the form of an autobiographical lament with the singer returning to her childhood home of Ohio and discovering that rampant development and pollution had destroyed the ""pretty countryside"" of her youth. The song makes a number of specific references to places in and around Akron Ohio including South Howard Street (line 5) and the historic center of Akron which was leveled to make way for an urban plaza with three skyscrapers and two parking decks (line 8).""\s\sAlso the song came out in 1982 which predates the election of either Bush by a few years.What a waste of money.DNC would have been better satire.Nothing spent pissing off Rush Limbaugh is wasted. Also PETA has done some good things.I was happy reading that title all the way up until the last word.I don't really like Limbaugh... but I fucking hate Peta. What a dumb bitch. So she took money from one cunt who just runs his mouth to a group of cunts who support and fund terrorists/murderers...Radio doesn't work that way - however instead of fighting they cut a check. Every radio station in the US pays for the right to play songs and royalties - if the Pretenders didn't have a record contract when they recorded it and remained independent it wouldn't be so clear cut but it's not like these things are completely pre-negotiated across the board with ASCAP and BMI to avoid this kind of shit.  It is not cheap and has been this way forever.\s\sCan you imagine what a quagmire of red tape it would become if every individual song required personal approval from the author to be played on the radio and could be denied if they disliked the individual DJs? It would end commercial radio in the US because it would be impossible to employ a staff large enough to handle the number of negotiations required.This is only the case when broadcasting music programming which Rush does not do.  When a piece of music is used as a promotional material it is subject to negotiated licensing agreements.I wonder if he attempted to negotiate to have the checks sent to the ASPCA instead.The NAACP or the SPLC might have been a more ironic destination.its a catchy intro songgood point.talk about leaving on a high note..Gunshots actually have almost all audible frequencies in their spectral pattern.Net worth: USD $95 million at the time of his death (approximately 1/611th of US GNP)He also surrounded himself with wet towels and blankets so any sparks from the weapon wouldn't accidentally burn down the house (which eventually was turned into a museum).

I doubt that an earlier anouncment would have changed the way things went.The PCR test kits were ready in January 2019.The antigen tests ( not PCR) we got free from the NHS are all Chinese made.Wonder if this was the Biden administration if this would have been reportedWhatever it takes to destroy Western civilization.[removed]reddit doesn't allow bit chute links sorry.Can anyone explain to me what critical race theory is?race communismWhat is this audio clip from?It's from a speech given by Mario Savio in Berekely CA over [50 years ago.](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/mario-savios-bodies-upon-the-gears-speech-50-years-later/Content?oid=2271095)\s\sSame as it ever was huh?And THIS is the old school real left liberal ethos I remain proudly in alignment with.\s\sBut I am now nearly numb to the shock and horror of witnessing nearly all from my camp not just fall to propaganda and fearporn but aggressively embrace the very evil corpo-govt power and DEMAND the true fascism they spent a lifetime loudly warning against. üò≥üòêüòîit's sad and i hope you can understand why a lot of people on the right are just beyond disgusted with liberals. but i know it's not all liberals. we need unity.This audio is fire!In Truck we trust \sKeep on truckingAlmost ironic to stick a left wing protestor from Berkeley over a Conservative anti-mandate protest.[Meanwhile it's actually ironic that people are demanding those same protestors be enslaved.](https://i.postimg.cc/VwGFKfYJ/image.png)Nothing is ‚Äúconservative‚Äù about a worker revolt and this merging of financial control with law enforcement is ultra-right authoritarianism.\s\sDon‚Äôt you people feel like you‚Äôve been fooled and don‚Äôt know what is what?Don't panic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo0o_XXqNosThis was known back in Dec 2020March 2020They're [the same](https://youtu.be/7WCfTREZSdQ)  picture.Perfect.

So this sadly is nothing more than speculation.Golly that seems pretty close to the ratio of vaxxed to unvaxxed ...If you use the actual 26% unvaxxed number that they buried in the article the vaccines are actually negatively effective at preventing both infection and now hospitalizations as well.So does that mean omicron is vaccine resistant?Huh? There are two different variables on each x axisAnd the 40% is just for London.  For all of England only 26% are unjabbed.  Source: the article.Trying to understand the pivot made in the article. First it says 20-40% of omnicron hospitalizations are unvaccinated. Then it says the data shows the importance and effectiveness of vaccines. Can anyone out there help with these mental gymnastics???> There have now been 668 Omicron hospitalizations among patients in England and **26% were unvaccinated**\s\sHOLY SHITNot only do the vaccines not protect you from infection but now they provide *negative protection* against hospitalization as well.Where I'm at in the US there's hundreds of people testing positive and then just going to the hospital and being turned away.\s\sNot because there's not room but because *they're not sick enough to require hospitalization*.\s\sPeople seem to think because you're testing positive you need to go to a hospital. The vast majority of them aren't even showing symptoms they're just going because they think that's what you do.Gee I wonder what could have possibly brainwashed them into thinking that the *common fucking cold* is a deadly virus - a virus so serious it necessitates destroying the global economy and human rights. \s\sI WONDER WHY THEY WOULD THINK THAT.An other article today states that 90% of people in ICU are ""unboostered"" so they already have their new scapegoats.The really sad part is that the absolute dumbest and most obvious examples of propaganda like that headline are swallowed whole by the general public without even the slightest idea that they are purposely being misled.The other 60% are *un*unvaccinated...the worst of the worst!This pisses me the fuck off.

How about some chats about instead.there definitely needs to be some organizing taking place. trump's new social media site?No excuse for doctors to be saying this shit. This is premeditated mass murder> Commenting on this article has ended \s\sLMAO[deleted]The govt will want to make sure that those rope are manufactured in china.FACT: This Covid vaccine is the 1st mRNA vaccines in history - it‚Äôs completely brand-new vaccine technology. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines turn your body into a spike protein-producing factory. \s\sFACT: All other vaccines in history have used traditional means such as live virus or attenuated virus instead. \s\sFACT: There‚Äôs NO long-term safety data because clinical trials for both Pfizer and Moderna end in 2023.\s\sFACT: This Covid mRNA vaccine does NOT prevent infection nor stop transmission of the coronavirus.\s\sFACT: It simply promises to prevent hospitalization and death except for ‚Äúrare‚Äù breakthrough cases. Omicron has infected SOOO many vaccinated people that ‚Äúrare‚Äù is not an accurate description.\s\sFACT: Survival rate of Covid is 99.97%. For people under 40 that number is way way higher. So there‚Äôs no need to inject healthy children or teenagers with it!\s\sFACT: Sweden France Iceland and Nordic nations are against giving Moderna shot to young under age 30 due to myocarditis (heart inflammation) risk. Some have even banned it for that age group.\s\sFACT: US hasn‚Äôt banned Moderna for young people under 30. Why? Maybe because NIH owns 1/2 of Moderna‚Äôs mRNA patent.\s\sFACT: Children and teenagers have higher risk of suffering myocarditis from the mRNA vaccine than from Covid itself.\s\sFACT: 18000+ deaths due to Covid vaccines are recorded in VAERS. Harvard study estimates that VAERS underreports actual vaccine adverse effects by as much as 100x. So true mortality rate of Covid vaccines may be 1800000. By contrast In 1976 when the Swine Flu vaccine caused 50 deaths it was pulled from the US market. \s\sFACT: Pfizer & Moderna mRNA trials do NOT have any IRB or independent Safety Board. \s\sFACT: Pfizer and Moderna initially promised 2 shots would be enough. They were wrong. Now it‚Äôs booster shots every 6 months for life. \s\sFACT: Vaccine makers promised that spike proteins would not migrate throughout your body especially not your reproductive organs. Now research has confirmed that mRNA shots have affected menstrual cycles. \s\sFACT: FDA took 108 days to review Pfizer data before EUA - But it wants 75 yrs to release safety data to public. \s\sFACT: If you suffer any serious side effects of the mRNA vaccine you CAN‚ÄôT sue the vaccine manufacturer. They have ZERO LIABILITY.\s\sFACT: Even if 100% of the entire human population on earth is vaccinated for Covid variants will still mutate and spread. Why? Because the coronavirus has an animal reservoir. That means wild animals can get Covid. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve been hearing lately in the news that we need to resign ourselves to Covid being endemic.\s\sFACT: Sub-Saharan African nations who have been taking IVERMECTIN as a preventative FOR YEARS have not suffered a Covid crisis - & that‚Äôs despite VERY LOW vaccination rates. \s\sFACT: Ivermectin won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for treating HUMAN BEINGS in 3rd World countries for tropical diseases. It has been used for more than 20 years and is EXTREMELY SAFE. It‚Äôs off-patent and very cheap too. It‚Äôs sold over-the-counter without a prescription in many countries. \s\sFACT: 140 research studies worldwide show ivermectin‚Äôs effectiveness in both preventing and treating Covid. \s\sWatch ‚ÄúCOVID SECRETS: RELOADED‚Äù series for more details! \s\shttps://vsecretscc.com/?a=5ef5014941a2f&b=57a0afadBannedThe evidence that the mutations are originating in various countries around the world then migrating here and infecting vaccinated people (at a lower rate) invalidates the claim that the unvaccinated (in the US) are the reason for mutations. Delta originated in India if memory serves me. And Omicron from South Africa was it?MRNA is made for people who cannot produce antibodies on their own. Dumbassjust wait until the deaths really start adding up in a year or two. track cancer stats also.https://www.thecentersquare.com/indiana/indiana-life-insurance-ceo-says-deaths-are-up-40-among-people-ages-18-64/article_71473b12-6b1e-11ec-8641-5b2c06725e2c.htmlThey‚Äôve just declared that VAERS data is all false reporting and washed their hands of it. $cience!!!Who declared that? Link?I don't understand what ""adult vaccination increased ulterior mortality of unvaccinated young""\s\sCan someone explain what that means?It means that vaccination of adults would be linked to all cause death with unvaccinated young. As if adults would be innjected with synthetic mRNA that has them replicate a toxic protein even in the lungs having them breathing out that toxin and poisoning the unvaccinated.\s\sThe Pfizer documentation on the original test phases mentioned shedding and the need to research. Many people report issues when coming in contact with recently vaccinated people mainly menstrual bleeding issues. All this is very widely contested from vaccine manufacterers.I guess the question is how many vaccines before the balance of cost-benefit changes even with these stats? and assuming that ADE and OAS don't happen in future variants or with Omicron.I don‚Äôt understand how a VMR of .004% (.04%? Might be a typo in the report) yields ~146000 vaccine related deaths. There‚Äôs ~331000000 people in the USA assuming everyone gets the vaccine 331000000*.0004= 132400‚Ä¶.. but everyone is not vaccinated‚Ä¶How many boosters will it take before people say no more?

And fear has affected almost everybody whereas the infection has affected relatively few‚Äù said Risch.\s\s‚ÄúBy and large it‚Äôs been a very selected pandemic and predictable. It was very distinguished between young versus old healthy versus chronic disease people. So we quickly learned who was at risk for the pandemic and who wasn‚Äôt‚Äù he added.\s\s‚ÄúHowever the fear was manufactured for everybody. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs characterized the whole pandemic is that degree of fear and people‚Äôs response to the fear.‚Äù\s\sRisch has authored over 300 original peer-reviewed publications and was formerly a member of the board of editors for the American Journal of Epidemiology.\s\s>‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at clinicians who have now treated more than 150000 patients with fewer than 2 dozen deaths with #hydroxychloroquine.‚Äù\s\s>Yale epidemiologist Dr. Harvey Risch on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine #Ivermectin & other therapeutics.\s\s>üî¥WATCHüëâhttps://t.co/AdFnjPmJvw pic.twitter.com/ozS0QbWFp7\s\s>‚Äî Jan Jekielek (@JanJekielek) December 1 2021\s\sThe epidemiology professor suggested that individuals who held the nominal positions of authority during the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 initially spread a much worse picture of the ‚Äúdire nature‚Äù of the virus than was warranted.\s\sThat included the message that everybody was at risk everybody could die from contracting the virus everybody needed to find protection everybody needed to stay in their homes and not socialize with others to protect themselves and in this way protect society Risch explained.\s\s‚ÄúPeople were quite afraid of that message as anybody would be‚Ä¶with the government with authorities with scientists scientific people with medical people in authority in the public health institutions all saying the same message starting in about February March of last year. And so we all kind of believe this‚Äù he said.\s\sIn the first two months of the pandemic stringent lockdowns and mask mandates were implemented to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in the United States and across the globe. Risch said that the types of messages issued by authorities led to widespread heightened anxiety levels.\s\s‚ÄúAll of our anxiety levels were raised and we all made decisions to curtail to various degrees our exposures to other people some more than others but I think everybody had levels of anxiety that really affected how they carry out their life at that time‚Äù he said.\s\sMeanwhile President Joe Biden has said that 96 to 98 percent of Americans need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before the nation can ‚Äúgo back to normal‚Äù pushing the rhetoric that unvaccinated Americans are to blame for slowing down the nation‚Äôs economic recovery.\s\sRelated Coverage\sCOVID-19 a Pandemic of Fear ‚ÄòManufactured‚Äô by Authorities: Yale EpidemiologistDr. Harvey Risch: Hydroxychloroquine Ivermectin and Other Therapeutics Highly Effective in Early COVID Treatment\sAccording to data by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Dec. 4 just over 70 percent of American adults are fully vaccinated against the virus while 23.9 percent have received a booster dose.\s\sWatch the full interview with Yale epidemiologist Dr. Harvey Risch below or watch and read the full transcript on EpochTV.Direct link to report - https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/team-builds-first-living-robots-that-can-reproduce/\sNEW - Researchers play god and create the first living AI-designed ""Xenobots"" that can self-replicate.\s\s\s\s***\s\sposted by [@disclosetv](https://twitter.com/disclosetv)\s\s[Video in Tweet](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1465429207585067018/pu/vid/800x448/17CTcjNENBjhpGIR.mp4?tag=12) | \s[Link in Tweet](https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/team-builds-first-living-robots-that-can-reproduce/)\s\s^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's‚ÄÖnew)](https://github.com/username)[deleted]Yes they are but if you‚Äôre smart you know how to counter thisKill each other before killing the remainingFirst time huh?She's not wrong.

But it's a pamphlet that tells people to wear your face covering correctly . It has a disclaimer on the bottom that reads ( the disposable face mask is not a surgical face mask or respirator protection device . This face mask is not intended for infection prevention or reduction  and is not intended for any medical  clinical or other high-risk setting . This face mask should not be used in the presence of a high intensity heat source or flammable gas ) .The first boxes of masks we got at my work when this started came from a city less than 100 miles from wuhanThat's for liability so you can't sue them and claim you caught it bc the mask wasn't 100% effective.  Not because they don't work.  Use your brain.Smh people are so dumb.

Animal reservoirs guarantee that this will be endemic and eventually the vlrus will reach someone with lmmunity beat out their B and T cells mutate upon realizing there‚Äôs a different viral key and we will have a new variant.

Different (and if I recall tested in the wild previously) technology that‚Äôs not causing these things? Or did so few people get J&J that nobody cares? \s\sI‚Äôm curious because everything is about P and M as if J never existed.It's similar to but not *exactly* the same as a conve tionsl vaccine. Put simply a conve tioanl vaccine uses dead virus or bacteria so your body recognizes it later on when faced with live ones. The Jansen /J&J uses virii similar to Sars-Cov19 and tricks your immune system into thinking its the real thing.\s\sIn trials the J&J showed approx 70% effective compared to the 90+% of the mRNA types. There were also concerns that adult women especially those taking hormone supplements could develop blood clotting (although this is an issue with a lot of different vaccines including the mRNA type).\s\sThat said there is now some concern that the mRNA vaccines may attack certain types of heart tissue for reasons as yet unknown.\s\sAfter having Covid a year ago I got the J&J several months later because I was expecting to travel to the EU for several weeks and I felt safer than with the other types. Sadly that fell. Through at the last minute. However not being a middle aged woman on birth control I'm not going to lose sleep over it.J and J is a traditional vaccine and not mRNA. It just sucked and didn‚Äôt really work at all (such that the system stopped promoting it) so it really isn‚Äôt a factor anymore.Where is the data for the unvaccinated to use as a comparison?The VE scores are compared to the unvaccinated. So a negative VE score as is the case for both vaccines after 91 days means the unvaccinated fare better.How do they tell one varient from the next?Alex Jones said this years agook this shit is over.\s\sNow tell the gubbernments to kindly FUCK OFF WITH THEIR FUCKING jab propaganda shitGot a real link with some actual info?I found this. \s\shttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2.full.pdf+html\s\s\sI'm reading it now it appears to back up the chart. Pfizer VE vaccine effectiveness is 55% but only if you've had a booster within the past month. \s\s\s""Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines respectively in the first month after primary vaccination. \s\s\sHowever the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months.

Where I live they can't fire you for not getting covid vaccines even/especially if you're in the medical field. Don't even have a friend who has been vaccinated. We all have parties and go out have good jobs go to restaurants never wear masks and everything else people were doing before the plandemic. Many of these people work in government and their work requires/has required them to be in the office for the entirety of the last 2 years besides vacation days. About half of these same people have never been tested and never will get tested. This is completely normal where I live. No one in my circle believes the vaccination rates big media puts out. The black and native american people in this large chain tend to have families that are extremely skeptical of the vaccines. Living in smaller towns without a lot of tourism does help lessen the spread but most everyone in the group has taken at least 2 vacations in the last couple years. Especially to mexico and florida. All of us try our best to eat healthy get enough sleep keep stress low and exercise. Most of us think we got covid for the first time in october or november of 2019. We don't trust anything but real science. And especially don't trust a war criminal mad scientist like Fauci. This isn't polio. Most of us have semi recent kin who died of that. If you're really scared of covid you're a pathetic human being with no business crawling out of your miserable holeThere are plenty of places especially in the US where very large populations of unvaccinated people are living just fine. Usually the areas where people majority don't allow the media & politicians to enslave them with lies & fear. Where I live in Georgia nowhere requires a mask nor do we have them in schools.

How exactly does one confirm the results of a shoddy trial. Sure Israel is panicking but the UK and Irish media remind me everyday about how the vaccine 'works' and how it's 'safe and effective'. After all we have data the trials went very well.Give corporations immunity and then wonder why they abuse it?""What are you working on?""\s\s""A covid vaccine.""\s\s""Oh cool will it give immunity to covid?""\s\s""No it will give immunity to prosecution.""\s\s""Why would I want that?""\s\s""You wouldn't; it's for us.""\s\sNote: I'm not some weird conspiracy theorist I'm just accepting the plain fact that immunity from liability is a moral hazard.[removed]The tide seems to be turning. This would have been blasphemy even 2 months ago with the covidians coming out of the woodwork to launch attacks on someone questioning the study. The fact that they can even publish this is significant.Publishing it is great but it also has to be covered by other media outlets to gain any traction. R/news and r/worldnews have been deleting these submissions all day and I doubt it will stop tomorrow. It's still blasphemy.So many people on this sub have said the same thing but now we are on shot number 3 being pushed onto people and in some cases number 4. Every company loves a subscription plan.[deleted]Yep the censorship has been brutal. Banning NNN was a big mistake. In NNN posts is where I was introduced to Kim Iversen; she is amazing.

Hopefully more information is forthcoming.Yep what I was going to say. BMJ covering this is big news.The BMJ has been amazing because one of their editors Peter Doshi has refused to become a cheerleader for big pharma and NPIs the way his counterparts at other journals have done (e.g. Richard Horton at The Lancet).\s\sIn September 2020 Doshi [wrote an extensive piece on natural immunity](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/370/bmj.m3563.full.pdf) pre-existing immunity and the role of T-cells. In January 2021 he [wrote a blog](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/04/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-we-need-more-details-and-the-raw-data/) calling for better data on vaccine efficacy and greater transparency around clinical trials.\s\sThe BMJ has also run some brilliant investigative pieces and doesn't shy away from running ""rapid responses"" and op-eds from medical professionals who are on the sceptical side\s\sYou should check out this [expos√© on quality control issues with the Pfizer vaccines](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627) which it ran in March 2021 based on leaked emails between the EU regulator (EMA) and Pfizer from December. The EMA found that many vaccine batches had low and inconsistent levels of RNA integrity meaning that if administered they might basically be placebos at best. This issue was said to have been resolved by the time  the EMA authorised the vaccine not long after but there was no transparency as to what criteria were set or how they were met.[removed]Well it wouldn't be a first time for Pfizer or actually any other big pharma company.The company that had to pay [a $2.3 billion settlement for fraud](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history) committed fraud again this time with legal protection?! *Unpredictable!*But wait... there‚Äôs more!!!\s\s\s\sPfizer adds ingredient used to stabilize heart attack victims in vax for kids ‚Äì via presscalifornia.com\sBuried on Page 14 in the Pfizer¬†paperwork¬†submitted to the FDA for the Covid vaccine for children is this disturbing nugget.\sVaccine formulation\sAuthorization is being requested for a modified formulation of the Pfizer‚ÄëBioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Knowing what I know I know what it is.They just used another commonly used buffer for stability and long shelf life. \sMany substances have multiple uses.

However they did show quite convincingly that there exists a viable cellular pathway whereby snippets of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA could become integrated into our genomic DNA.\s\sSo yeah you could argue that there's a risk from the vaccine but still less than from the virus.\s\sSo what point are you making about vaccination of kids? Seems you didn't actually read the article you linked.I hate Big Pharma and quite happy to see an article like that in a serious journal. However Pfizer is ... worse than I thought I would say. I didn't know they would screw up so much and do stupid random stuff such as ""not storing vaccines at the right temperature"". How can you be so incompetent ? Kids working in fast food chains know you need to store your sensible products at the right temperature but not Pfizer employees ?   \sI won't comment on how they mismanaged the side effects reporting (we knew they would)  \s\s\sI hope things will go sour day by day for Pfizer and hope they'll crash. I'm waiting for that.To be entirely accurate the shoddy practices were in Ventavia an outside contractor doing trials for Pfizer.  But they too should know better.  And at the very least these problems should have been passed up the chain of responsibility to Pfizer and the FDA and acted on.  They weren't.\s\sIt's depressing reading that one of the problems Jackson identified was ""targeting of staff for reporting problems"".  Yeah like in *every* case of dodgy practices company culture's first reaction is to cover it up and bully those who highlight it.[deleted]Hmm the company with Billions maybe even Trillions to make if the vaccine gets approved is running their own studies/tests that will make or break it with little to no oversight. And then tell them if the study says its safe go ahead and make your trillions and if it later turns out unsafe we'll give you unlimited unconditional immunity. What could possibly go wrong??So many ruined lives because of such a shoddy product...but this isn't new.And 1000 times and more lives saved by this ""shoddy"" product.Here is a mirrored link to the bmj paper it appears that the bmj site is down or pulled the page off of the internet: https://q17.ca/reading/bmj/bmj.n2635.full.pdfCan‚Äôt wait for this to be all over the news Reddit and Twitter‚Ä¶It won't.

The full trial (registered under¬†***NCT04368728***) enrolled around 44‚Äâ000 participants across 153 sites that included numerous commercial companies and academic centres. She then listed a dozen concerns she had witnessed including:  \s>  \s>‚Ä¢ Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff  \s>  \s>‚Ä¢ Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events  \s>  \s>‚Ä¢ Protocol deviations not being reported  \s>  \s>‚Ä¢ Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures  \s>  \s>‚Ä¢ Mislabelled laboratory specimens and  \s>  \s>‚Ä¢ Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.  \s>  \s>Within hours Jackson received an email from the FDA thanking her for her concerns and notifying her that the FDA could not comment on any investigation that might result. A few days later Jackson received a call from an FDA inspector to discuss her report but was told that no further information could be provided. She heard nothing further in relation to her report.This was written by Paul Thacker.  He is great.  He is interviewed in a few episodes of the podcast Origins Birth of a Pandemic and he slays Fauci and Daszak.As damning as this is it's really not going to do a whole lot. It's only one sub-contracted facility with a small number of their trial participants and can be easily brushed off if it went mainstream.

Our ancestors could never have imagined us willingly giving into this thus it was never specifically mentioned in laws or constitutions.But they were never faced with a respiratory illness like Covid. Have you seen the way it has cut humanity down in droves? 0.00001% of us have died!California needs to be carefully challenged by the Supreme Court. I can't speak to anywhere else although I think it was similar in Hawaii but initially we not only were required to remain inside for all non-essential reasons the police monitored it (or pretended to) with checkpoints at possibly county lines something that may have just been in my county unsure. We could not drive and park and then walk unless it was for an essential reason. We could only walk from our houses as far as we could go. If you were disabled you were housebound. If you had to pee you had to pee in the bushes even if you were a 65-year old woman. People could not meet from outside of their houses even outdoors.  \s\s\sEverything was shut down in two days or less. Everything. The airport wasn't shut but all non-essential flights were stopped. Public transit was stopped. All that was open was the pharmacy with most behind plexiglas and the supermarket bank and post office.   \s\s\sI can't see how this was not an extreme Civil Rights or Constitutional violation and while the worst counties in California flew a bit under the radar they were doing this on the vague authority of the Governor but only because he told County Health who are not elected at all but who are appointed ""Do whatever you need.""They were already banned. Many countries constitutions explicitly state freedom of movement freedom of association and freedom of speech. It's just that no politician had the balls to stand up for people's civil rights. \s\sA constitution is just a piece of paper. It means nothing. It confers no rights unless people are willing to risk dying to defend it. It's as simple as that.>There will never be true normalcy until lockdowns are specifically banned everywhere when people don‚Äôt have to fear the government shutting down their businesses and confining them to their homes.\s\sYep.\s\s>Folks festivals and concerts are now back on! *nobody books tickets because they might close*\s\s>Folks restaurants are now allowed to function again! *nobody takes out a loan to open one because they might close*\s\s>Folks cities are back to normal! *nobody moves back to the cities because that normalcy is not permanent*\s\s>Folks gyms are now open! *nobody buys a membership because it's expected to be unusable at random timesFounding fathers didNow do all the other countries![deleted]I LOVE headlines like this.

Honestly tired of the Reuters feed being regurgitated as ""news"" worldwide. I can imagine this is probably due to lack of time in writing this up. Would love to hear more from locals who visit this subreddit. \s\sAttaching a link which I thought had more depth in coverage of this crucial ruling from a local source. Check this from [El Pais](https://english.elpais.com/spain/2021-07-14/spains-top-court-rules-that-the-coronavirus-state-of-alarm-was-unconstitutional.html).\s\sThe debate seems to fall in agreeing whether Spain's lockdowns fell under a 'state of alarm' (as employed by their government) or under a 'state of emergency' (as practiced by suspension of basic rights). \s\sAn especially important point here is that 'state of emergencies' have to be discussed in Congress before being implemented. However 'state of alarm' need not. From my understanding the Spanish government implemented restrictions that fall under 'state of emergency' under the pretext of 'state of alarm'. They bypassed debate and consensus from their Congress to implement restrictions. Therefore it was unconstitutional. \s\sPoint to note is that the initial restrictions were still unanimously agreed upon by their Congress. It is only now that the conservatives are fighting them. Moreover even this verdict barely resembles an agreed upon opinion (6-5 ruling). \s\sDevelopments here could be key. Not just for global reactions but also for future scenarios.[deleted]I have mixed feelings on this...\s\sIt worries me that the decision was made after a vote so close and also that there is no debate about the restrictions of civil liberties needing a legitimate purpose and why this specific health hazard should be seen as such\s\sEdit: and also the a priori decision that the ruling must not allow citizens or businesses to get compensation for the damages caused by the restrictions the government imposed on them is insane> However 'state of alarm' need not\s\sNot exactly from my understanding of the article a ""state of alarm"" can be done by the government but must then also be retroactively approved by Congress:\s\s> *""Another key difference relates to the fact that a state of alarm is initially agreed on by the government and subsequently debated in Congress where it is approved or rejected by deputies""*\s\sAnd Congress granted them their approval:\s\s> *""Other constitutionalists have defended that the use of the state of alarm during the first stage of the pandemic ‚Äì a measure that was initially backed by parties of all ideological stripes in Congress ‚Äì was the appropriate move in a health emergency such as the coronavirus crisis""*\s\sIn fact in light of a ""state of emergency"" allowing for more fundamental rights to be suspended (courtless detention for up to 10 days instead of 3 warrantless entry of police and shutting down of media companies etc.) and the 100% of support granted by Congress it's almost as if it was rather a blessing in disguise.\s\sEDIT: Excerpts from the El Pais article.Thanks for the link! Much more informative.\s\s‚ÄúThis is an unprecedented decision‚Äù the sources from La Moncloa continued in criticism of the ruling ‚Äúgiven that all of our neighboring countries have resorted to similar formulae within their respective legislations.‚Äù\s\sSo is this governmental official's version of:\s\s""But all my friends are doing it! üòÇRight.

No room for companies to sue the state for damages apparently.   \s\sThey're **claiming the actions weren't wrong the process was**.\s\sThey're literally saying it was done right by following other countries and international organisms.

This will not eliminate the possibility of it repeating**.     \s\sNot really good news honestly.So they‚Äôre saying the lockdowns were fine but the way they were set into law/made legal wasn‚Äôt? Gross.>following other countries and international organisms. \s\sI think this has been the worst part of the creeping tyranny. It has been justified by the logic of a five-year-old caught doing something naughty: ""but the others are also doing it!""\s\sThis is why I uphold that any support for the mandates and measures is support for covid tyranny and injustice everywhere. The police where we live might not beat people to pulp but the mask signals support for the police brutality in Spain Holland Belgium and beyond.I share your skepticism. Based on what Germany has experienced in regards to the *Infektionsschutzgesetz* they'll just use this as a reason to introduce or change laws so that lockdowns become essentially legal. And it's not unlikely people will still be clapping to that and celebrating the politicians as saviours of humanity or something.\s\sI know this is reverse doomerism but I've been disappointed too often since this all began to have any faith left in the judicial system. I hope I may be wrong though.No shitSpain‚Äôs stay-at-home rules were absolutely raving bonkers even by the mad standards of the lockdown era.And it's now pretty clear that they did next to nothing in terms of stopping spread of PCR positives.Every country in the world has violated the UN Declaration on Human Rights at the least which is advisory but also has some teeth to it all in all. But I wonder how many countries and states have violated their own highest legal charters? My guess is quite a few.Here in Austria the Parliament has essentially delegated law-making to the Health Minister.\s\sAnd the Constitutional Court approved of this even though it expressly and repeatedly rejected it in the past. This is a massive institutional failureThe problem with courts is how slow they are and how long they take. Governments obtained emergency powers and then through a variety of means enacted lockdowns. I‚Äôd bet a fair amount of them were unconstitutional in most countries. If not initially then due to time limits on emergency authority. \s\sEven still in some cases courts have said ‚Äúyeah that would be unconstitutional but pandemic‚Äù. Courts aren‚Äôt machines they are people that sometimes have agendas.I wonder if this is why even deep blue states are dropping lockdowns.  Once ruled on by a court the power is lost forever but if made ""moot"" or ""academic"" due to Lockdowns being phased out no ruling is passed and the power remains to be used again.HallelujahStanding ovation for the Spanish Supreme Court\s\s#üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªI wish my country could do the same thing...So have all the restrictions been lifted? Can La Liga start with full stadiums? Are clubs fully open? Any festivals for the remainder of the summer? Please let me know so I can book my vacation.No. Honestly all is closed. Nightlife is nonexistant. Don't come here. Wait until this madness is over. Hope to see you soon here but the current state of affairs is depressing unless you are into clandestine raves and being harassed by the police for leaving your house at night.This was just the ""stay at home"". For sure the *entire* lockdown was unconstitutional. A government can't simply impose such restrictions without proper scientific documentations for their effect (both positive and negative).One of our most important (and most neglected) problems as society is how ridiculously slow the jurisdiction works. I have thought so various times in Germany. In theory we have rule of law. But in practice it can take years until a court decides in your favour and if you're poor you will not bother to sue anyone anyway because you have no money for a lawyer. Apparently the Spanish courts are not faster either: The government suspends basic human rights and 14 months later the courts decide that this was unconstitutional. What should future governments take from this ruling? Hopefully they will not go for renewed lockdowns as they have to fear that they could be unconstitutional. On the other hand a future government could think ""last time the majority cheered for lockdowns and the courts will take a year to decide anyway so I have one year of time for a 2 week lockdown""Funny how it's only now after this so-called pandemic is over that suddenly we care about constitutions. Where was Spain's top court when those rights were being trampled?Actual meaning of this: They should've declared a state of emergency (estado de excepci√≥n) which is limited to a maximum of 30 days and cannot be renewed.Interesting (and appropriate) that it cannot be renewed.I don't understand how it took so long. The law clearly states that the lockdown (which in Spain is called alarm state) can only be declared for a max of 15 days and you need Parliament approval to extend it (which they did not).\s\sCan't expect anything from a half communist governmentI read that there are 3 states ""State of Emergency"" ""State of Exception"" and ""Under Siege"". We had the first in which you can't do any of that nonsense. What you are describing sounds like one of the other two that require Parlimetary approval.   \s\s\sAnyway fuck the commie government and fuck Colau.Lockdowns should be abolishedWait there is a top court ? Must have been founded yesterday because this has been going  for more than a year.Excellent news.\s\sNow those who violated the law will be held accountable and sent to jail right? Right!?BASED SPAIN\s\sNow do UK and USCanada could use some help too.\s\sI haven't seen the judiciary make any attempt since the start of the pandemic to curb any of the overreach of any level of government's extraordinary powers.\s\sIn the case of the Adamson's BBQ restaurant owner in Mississauga Ontario the judge placed a gag order on the defendant's freedom to use social media and allowed the City of Toronto to try the unprecedented move of pinning the cost of three days of dozens of jackbooted municipal police officers on his premise keeping it shuttered as a fine totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.[deleted]It's not based at all. Nothing will happen. Masks are still worn with enthusiasm in the street.A surprise to be sureso what? nothing will ever come out of it :(This is a great vindication of our cause - even though the article is at pains to point out that the plaintiff was a far right political party.So are things back to normal now?We already have another curfew in place. The ruling was just agains the national ""state of alarm"" issued by S√°nchez. Now ""autonomous communities"" (comunidades aut√≥nomas) have the legal right to impose restrictions as opposed to the central government in Madrid. This ruling has had almost a nonexitant effect. Bars and pubs still closed curfew at 1 am in most parts of the country mask mandate still required tons of police around every corner.  \s\s\sDeaths are plummeting ICU and hospital beds are occupied by 14 and 6 percent COVID patients we have a vaccination rate of almost 60% of all adults WITH TWO DOSES. This is nonsense. It does not make sense. I received a message from the health department saying that I should NOT VISIT ANYONE outside my family unit DESPITE ME HAVING 2 DOSES of the vaccine. This is just masochism at this point. Work from home consume media go to sleep repeat. I have considered suicide multiple times this last month. This is absurd.When your hospitals filled up with sick people then see if that‚Äôs unconstitutional.Blah blah blah.  Same tired line.  Yet we never see pictures of said hospitals.  Just vague predictions about what will definitely maybe happen at some point in the future. Possibly. \s\s I wonder why that is?Thanks for your submission.

This is not the place to offer ungrounded or low-quality speculations about vaccine efficacy at preventing serious COVID-19 illness or side effects nor is it the place to speculate about nefarious coordination among individuals or groups via vaccinations. As the current evidence stands vaccinations appear to be a broadly effective prevention of serious outcomes from COVID-19 and should be the ‚Äúway out‚Äù of the pandemic and pandemic-justified restrictions of all kinds. We are more concerned about vaccine policies (e.g. mandates). Top level posts about those or about vaccines against COVID-19 should reflect *new* developments and/or serious original empirical research.We will also remove comments shaming/blaming individuals for their personal health decisions whatever those are.\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/LockdownSkepticism) if you have any questions or concerns.*The biggest study of over 100K backs natural immunity while CDC still clings on poor data from few hundred patients with dubious results. CDC needs to align with science or acknowledge uncertainties and not back inferior studies.Good luck with that considering they threw out decades of high-quality research into the effectiveness of masking in favor of a case study of two hairdressers.Yes the glaring discrepancies in sample size are just appalling.The fact that natural immunity wasn't discussed or researched as strongly as the vaccines tells you all you need to know about whether this whole response was based on science or not. For every person who doesn't need a vaccine due to natural immunity is potentially a life saved in a developing nation.\s\sAlso the fact that Dr. Fauci NEVER ONCE denounced the open southern US border as a vector of disease transmission shows his political bias. A total TWO MILLION immigrants are expected to cross this year alone and some estimates show that about 10% of them were Covid positive. If that isn't a super-spreader event I don't know what is.And of course there‚Äôsna large number of migrants flowing through texas which conveniently just so happens to be standing up to the feds on pretty much everything. Now the feds can used these migrant infectionsnthat spread through texas as proof their measures aren‚Äôt workijg and the only way out of it is kissing the ring of biden[removed]When they began disregarding natural immunity I realized that the only ‚Äúscience‚Äù being followed was the science of maximizing profit.[It's a conspiracy theory!](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/05/anti-vaxxers-have-a-dangerous-theory-called-natural-immunity-now-its-going-mainstream/) lmao what the actual fuck.  Reminds me of those Sebastian Gorka ""Relief Factor"" commercials where Pete and Seth Talbott have this CRAZY theory that our bodies were **designed to heal.** That's right - millenia of human existence without modern medicine and these dipshits came up with the wild idea that our bodies could heal naturally lmao.\s\sSame logic as a ""natural immunity conspiracy theory.""  Fucking hundreds of thousands of years of humanity coexisting with pathogens with no antibiotics vaccines etc... but somehow ""natural immunity"" is the conspiracy.  Fuck me it's all so dumb.I'm very pro-vaccine and not a conspiracy theorist but I've slowly come to believe that the only plausible explanation for why the US is almost alone in ignoring natural immunity is because the powers-that-be across the political spectrum want Pfizer and Moderna to make as much money as possible.\s\sIt's the only explanation I can figure for why the FDA and the blue checkmarks seemed to intentionally tank J&J vaccine uptake in the US with that temporary pause plus the constant social media messaging saying that the more expensive mRNA vaccines are superior.   Pfizer costs $15-20 per dose and Moderna costs $25-40 per dose and you need two; J&J costs $10 per dose and you only need one.  Combine that with the fact that the new employer mandates are focused solely on requiring vaccination and it's not hard to figure out.\s\sAs distasteful as I find immunity passports at least they offer the option of verifying natural immunity rather than being single-mindedly focused on vaccination status.   Instead the US has gone down the path of proof of vaccination versus proof of immunity.   In our state after a PK-12 student has recovered from confirmed covid they don't have to quarantine after subsequent exposures for 3 months - many employers had similar policies when sector restrictions were still in place prior to May 2021.   Why was/is natural immunity considered ""good enough"" for at least a period of time anywhere but in the US?[deleted]Exactly I hate this line of thinking. You shouldn‚Äôt be required to inject a product - immune or not.You'd think they would be happy that they don't need to coerce as many people into taking the vaccine because some of them are already immune. It's better for everyone involved except Pfizer.So much of this is ego-driven. Before the vaccines were approved and released many people asserted that natural immunity would be superior to vaccine-aided/attempted immunity. The people who weren't vaccine true believers argued that there was a good chance natural immunity would be more robust and long-lasting. This is one of the vaccine debates that also predated COVID.\s\sThe vaccine cheerleaders do not want to give an inch and admit that the people who argued the value of natural immunity were at all correct in any way. The heretics are wrong for questioning the religion. Can't back down from that. Any concessions might be the beginning of the end for the whole belief system these people are so invested in.Amazing how two words tacked onto the end of yor comment reveal everything.The worst thing about natural immunity is that it provides defence against a wider range of viruses and hence prevents new variants from emerging. And then the pharmaceutical companies will have nothing to make a vaccine for :(Pay attention to what‚Äôs happening in prisons and hospitals in Democrat-run cities like LA and NYC.\s\sThey‚Äôre about to be overrun and this is not a game.\s\sNY has declared a State of Emergency. Gavin Newsome has exempted corrections officers in California because prisons are dangerously short staffed keep losing more staff due to fatigue and dangerous working conditions and the prison populations keep growing. \s\sWe could be on the verge of total societal collapse sooner than we think in those Democrat-run hellholes.>except Pfizer\s\sIt's almost as if... nah nevermind.This has never been about what's best or what makes sense.Yes. They should also be happy that COVID's mortality rate is below 1 % and doesn't affect children. They should also be happy that it leaves robust immunity even after mild infection or that there are promising treatments being tested.\s\sBut no this anguers them. They want this disease to be worse than Ebola. Maybe that's the only way they can rationalize sacrificing so much over it.Would it be the beginning of the end for vaccine mandates ? It means every companies every government etc would have to force you to take an antibodies test to force you a vaccine. This is way less convenient and more costly than those rapid PCR test.[deleted]Lol. The organization that I work for (that's mandating the vax for all employees) had an all-staff Q&A. One of the questions directed at the official behind our vax mandate was something along the lines of ""why was there no consideration given for people with natural immunity?"" Their response? ""Uhhhh welllllll we don't exactly know enough about natural immunity to Covid to comment on that soooo uhhhhh think of it as if you're double protected with both!"" That's some big brain science for you from an MD/MPH.Crazy how some science matters but others don‚Äôt. Pure dogma nothing scientific about it.Yeah we have only been monitoring it 3x as long as the vaccines there is so much we still don't know!This is not about health and it never has been.\s\sCovid today is only focused on perfect complete and unquestioning compliance. Maybe it always was.\s\sIt is about every human complying with every order for everything they ever do with everyone made absolutely inescapable with technology surveillance and social control. It is the worst dictatorship that was ever devised and unless earlier regimes this one will never rest and be content with an obedient personality cult. Every regulation can be increased to save one more human life somewhere sometime and so it will be resembling the Khmer Rouge rather quickly in its required total subordination.Ignoring natural immunity has no doubt led to doctors (knowingly or not) pushing unnecessary medical procedures on their patients. The COVID vax risk/reward for say a 15 year old boy is already pretty dubious according to the UK's JCVI. Now what's the risk/reward  if he already has natural immunity? Surely that has to factor in for the patient to make an informed decision.This could be the ace in the hole for striking down vaccine mandates nationwide.  The science supports natural immunity as being as effective or MORE effective than the vaccines.I kind of hate this argument though. The thing is - I shouldn‚Äôt need to put a product into my body. Whether I have natural immunity or not.Any chink in their armour helps. They‚Äôre probably not going to be able to strike them down all at once but it emboldens the no-mandate position if they make a major concession like this one for natural immunity. \s\sI personally won‚Äôt give up the fight until the last COVID measure is reversed but perhaps winning such a major battle will help win the war :)I had what I believe to be COVID really early on like in January of 2020 before it was even a pandemic in the USA. Is there any way for me to prove that I have natural immunity?Some people have reported that a T-cell test was able to provide proof they had recovered long ago however that test doesn't appear to be available in every country. This is one developer (no relation): https://www.t-detect.com/   \s\sMainstream news article about it: https://abc11.com/t-cell-covid-test-t-detect-adaptive-biotechnologies-coronavirus-symptoms/10411997/  \s\sNature article about it: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00920-9Same for me Feb. 2020. Mysterious non-flu virus that caused double pneumonia gave me a 103 fever and made me lose taste and smell. Have lingering symptoms I never had before‚Äîhives. I‚Äôve come back negative for antibodies but that was months after I was sick. Problem is no insurances will cover b- or t-cell tests so how can you and I know?\s\sEDIT: *Antibodies* not *antibiotics*. Autocorrect strikes again!That article balancing 246 people in Kentucky with tens of thousands of people in Israel and saying the study out of Isreal showed ""at least as"" effective immunity... Are you fucking kidding? In a group of 30000 it showed that SARS CoV2-naive people who were vaccinated were 27 times more likely to be infected than people with a previous infection. Go fuck yourself Yahoo. Also why would we keep referring to studies measuring antibody titers in vitro when we have a whole planet of real life data?I seriously doubt this information will change anything.This. I got Covid relatively early in 2020 wasn't shit never got it again.>Zywicki said a modern legal analysis should also consider the Supreme Court‚Äôs 1927 ruling in *Buck v. Bell* which solidified individual rights to bodily autonomy.  In *Buck* the court voided a Virginia statute authorizing the state to force sterilization on men and women deemed mentally deficient. \s\sNo. [The complete opposite](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/274us200):\s\s>The Court found that the statute did not violate the Constitution. . . .  Citing the best interests of the state Justice Holmes affirmed the value of a law like Virginia's in order to prevent the nation from ""being swamped with incompetence . . . **Three generations of imbeciles are enough.**""\s\sAmazingly *Buck* has [never been expressly overturned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell).So states have that right.  Seems clear.  But the federal government isnt the states.Natural immunity is obviously overlooked as an alternative to vaccine mandates but the bigger question is why we are mandating immunity in the first place?\s\sImmunity either through natural means or vaccination still *does not prevent you* from spreading the disease. What is the point of checking immunity status at the door before entering an establishment or workplace if you may be carrying the virus simultaneously and thus spread it to everyone you meet?\s\sConsider this scenario with people A B and C.\s\s- Person A is double vaccinated. He is currently carrying the virus. He goes to enter a bar and has his vax pass check. He is allowed to enter where he can spread COVID to the other patrons.\s\s- Person B has natural immunity. He is currently carrying the virus. He goes to enter a bar and has an anti-body test to prove his immunity. He is allowed to enter where he can spread COVID to the other patrons.\s\s- Person C has no immunity. He is not carrying or infected with the virus. He goes to enter a bar and is denied entry because he may be a ""threat"" to the already vaccinated and naturally immune patrons inside.\s\sAm I the only one who see zero logic in a vaccine mandate? Why is the world clinging to this?No you are 100% correct.  What you are missing is that this stopped being about logic and became about punishment a long time ago.  Naturally the only people who are not vaccinated are stupid inbred Trumpers.  Now don't go noticing that the largest age group that is not vaccinated are 20-30somethings and that the largest racial group is african americans hardly the cornerstone of the republican party.  Don't let that fool you they are all Trumpers.So if we manage to screw the pharmaceutical companies out of perpetual mandatory COVID vaccines does that mean we have to send our troops back to the poppy fields in Afghanistan?F yeah!There can't be a serious scientific discussion about covid without discussing natural immunity. \s\shttps://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/312637Not recognized in Canada and I as fully vaccinated have to defend friends and family who recovered from Covid and don't want the vaccine. Some totally understand but others have a blank expression of not computing what natural immunity is. Nevermind comparing one shot for life polio vaccine to whatever this is.\s\sWe also have Novavax & Medicago vaccines manufactured in Quebec probably coming to market early next year a lot of classified unvaccinated might opt for.One ray of hope for me has been that the business news has been left relatively untainted since Covid began. All of them have no scruples printing the opposing view.\s\sThis makes sense as a trader you really have to separate yourself from the emotions and make decisions with a clear head. No matter what you think *should* happen you're going to lose all your money doubling down on wrong. I remember some staffers were screeching about a Tom Cotton op-ed in the WSJ and the WSJ basically told them to grow up.Thanks for your submission.

But one of the worst enemies we face is **naturalisation**.  Where choices previously made - e.g. er the choice to treat a serious but not catastrophic disease as if it was a zombie plague - are bedded down into ""natural"" reality as if they've imposed by the world rather than by political decision.  So we get idiocies like ""well we have to vaccinate children otherwise their education will be disrupted by the *natural inevitable* bubble/self-isolation which will happen"".\s\sIn the UK this is also known as the TINA thought-terminating clich√© after Thatcher's famous ""There Is No Alternative"" phrase.What is this today?

A government response that ACTUALLY is based on science?I remembered how Bloomberg said that the booster shots are distributed due to fear rather than actual science. A lot of common sense going around rnA government response based on science at this point is to remove lockdowns and remove ""safety"" measures. Some places have done it successfully but other places (Alberta canada) still have a huge number of people who self-impose restrictions and are actively campaigning to have them put back in place for everybody.\s\sMost people have become used to these things as a comfort blanket...

Finally got forced into getting the shot and was the most sick I've felt in years. 24 hrs of fever sweating and chills. \s\sI can objectively say that the vaccine was worse than the actual disease in my case.NO! You're suppose to be dead! That's not how this works!My whole family just had it as well. Nanny gave it to us first her then my 6 yr old and 4 yr old we‚Äôre sick for 2-3 days with very very mild cold symptoms. Then our 6 month old had a runny nose and cough for about 3 days. Then it hit me and my husband - I will say it was like a cold on steroids. No fever for either of us but the worst sore throat followed by some achy chest pain mild cough and congestion. I was really tired and also kept waking up at night sweating but no fever ever. It was like a really bad weird cold. We never lost taste or smell. \s\sWe are in late 30s totally fine now. Kids were barely sick. Our nanny also in her 30s was basically asymptomatic she thought her allergies were acting up when she had it.\s\sWe are not vaccinated.

On one side you have people scared of the virus and on the other side you have people scared of the vaccine. Both are rooted in irrational fear. The data is abundantly clear. We don‚Äôt need to be scared of the virus. We don‚Äôt need to be scared of the vaccine.Almost everybody is going to have to catch it eventually whether they have been vaccinated or not. We just keep delaying the inevitable. That has been the path out since the beginning. Booster shots don't change that. I'll take my chances with the virus.[deleted]What I especially don't understand are the parents who are frantic about their healthy children catching covid (and I'm a mother of two so I do have skin in this game). Why wouldn't we want them to have it now when the overwhelming likelihood is that they'll have a very mild illness if anything? It's not fun when your kid is ill but that's part of life they are lucky they can catch it now rather than in their 60s.> I'll take my chances with the virus.\s\sI've been courting her for 19 months. So far she hasn't shown any interest. Between you and me I'm pretty sure she's a gold digger going after older guys.Like from the start we should have been looking for ways to treat the virus (instead lf suppressing treatment) instead of trying to prevent infection at all costs which is turning out to be quite an exercise in futilityThis is how our natural immune system works. Yes I am not a doctor but I have doctors in my family including one who actually ran a covid unit in NY.  He said if you are healthy you should really expose yourself to the disease. He also said the hospital he works in had the disease completely under control until NY State Health got involved and the lockdowns began. That is when the deaths started happening. He also said if you get the disease take asprin to thin your blood then kill the virus with a ton of vitamin C . I am not a doctor so please don't follow this advice and pin it on me if it doesn't work but the doctor I got that from is a cardiologist who performs open heart surgery and he is compeltely frightened by the NY State health department so much that he is moving to Florida.If they could barely vaccinate 60-70% of the total population in the US good luck getting anywhere near that with boosters.I agree with this but when you‚Äôre going to catch it why not take your chances with the virus but with the added protection of the vaccine. That‚Äôd be like running into battle without a bulletproof vest. Sure you could get shot in the head but the vest is going to help you out most of the time.Yes!! Why have I and my entire family been trying to live as normally as possible and are still well??Wow an article that makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one. Bookmarking this to wave in people's faces in the next few months.Spot onArchive it I've seen far too many websites either take articles away or change them to keep the narrative going. \s\sIf you use FireFox you can right click the page and take a screenshot and clip the whole page.The fact the BBC has published this is a major deal they would not dream of it even 3 months ago let alone 6 months ago.[deleted]I‚Äôm going to wave this in my manager‚Äôs face after she got my case about me not being vaccinated. I had a mild cough and a positive test and low and behold I haven‚Äôt been sick for a year now despite trying my very damndest to get another positive result so I can use that to travel another 6 months.Great response going forward:\s\sAre you vaccinated??\s\sNo I'm vindicated.Even with this FDA approval coming I‚Äôm feeling the tide shift slightly. Vindication is def coming.If you have had 1-2 shots you are not in danger of hospitalization right? So catching something like the delta is no biggy even if it would have been otherwise (for 98% of the people it would not have even without the Vax but whatever).\s\sNow catching the delta and fighting it off in a couple of days with no consequences will give you a good immunity against the delta and will boost your immunity against covid in general.\s\sOn the other hand a third booster with **the old vaccines** will do nothing of the sort while potentially increasing the side effects.\s\sI would choose the virus to a booster.A thread where you can speak freely about being unvaccinated without massive downvotes on ukpol? What utopia have I woken up to?> Prof Adam Finn a government vaccine adviser said over-vaccinating people when other parts of the world had none was ""a bit insane it's not just inequitable it's stupid"".\s\sWow I love this article already.They are acting like natural and artificial immunities just stack. That‚Äôs a huge assumption and not one in line with the vaccines we are using. The article explains why natural immune system have advantages but it doesn‚Äôt seem to appreciate how the vaccine can interfere with that system. Even when the BBC gives me a reason to have faith again they make me lose faith.It also was kind of a let down that it said :\s\s""There is clear evidence that adults who have not had any vaccine dose will have stronger immune defences if they do get vaccinated even if they have caught Covid before"".\s\sI have not seen any ""clear evidence"" that people who've already had covid fare better if they also get the shots.Tbh I'll take this. There's been so little common sense or objectivity in the msm at least they're asking the question.Yes we have ADE and a whole host of other ways where a bad vaccine can actually damage your natural immune systems (we have 2 innate and acquired)‚ÄúNow‚Äù?üåéüßë‚ÄçüöÄüî´üßë‚ÄçüöÄAlways has been.100% \s\sThat's why I didn't really do anything to prevent getting it. I kind of just wanted to get it and get it over with. I'm hopeful more info like this gains traction. The denial over antibodies and immune response from Covid needs to come to an end.Unless you‚Äôre high risk it always was.I'll be damned. An actual sensible article published in a mass global media outlet.Always has been.Well for most people. I would exempt elderly and morbidly obese.Always has been. Natural immunity is always better than artificial immunity.

Places ARE going to open up more and life WILL go on in some more normal fashion. But the government and media just spent a year and a half working people up. I think now a lot of higher ups are realizing that it's not going to be so easy to go back to normal unless people are eased into it.\s\sA big problem with pushing a narrative and calling stats & science ""misinformation"" is that now it's so much harder for the government to use stats and science to defend opening up. So they've gotten to the point they talked about a year ago but now their doomers have been trained too well and they have to find ways to transition and move forward without looking like they're backpedaling.\s\stl;dr:\s\s*""How can we ease people into accepting as truth now what we called ""conspiracy theories"" three months ago?""* And that's how we get articles like this.I hope you're right but I fear they'll just slam everything shut again in the fall.Generally very positive for a change!  It even punctures the ""bbbb...ut... antibody levels *decline üò±""* canard by discussing T-cells and memory cells.\s\sI don't understand the kiss-off line though:\s\s""I'm wondering whether it's inevitable"" said Prof Klenerman as if the virus continues to spread then ""there will be this ongoing boosting effect"".\s\sHow can the virus ""continue to spread"" when (remember this is a UK article) the ONS estimates that 93-95% of the population has immunity?  And how does this produce a ""boost""?  Makesa no sensa.I think they just mean that it‚Äôs becoming clear that neither natural infection nor vaccines confer long-lasting sterilizing immunity so people are going to get ‚ÄòRona repeatedly.  And every time they‚Äôre exposed to it that‚Äôs a natural ‚Äúbooster‚Äù to their immune system to be able to fight it off with only mild illness.  So basically it‚Äôs a positive thing they‚Äôre saying they just phrased it weird.I‚Äôm actively going around looking to get covid again would not risk with leaky vaccines in a million years.Same here any place in particular? I just can‚Äôt seem to get it quite frustrating to be honest.[deleted]Hung out with my boy who had covid (didn‚Äôt get tested though cause he didn‚Äôt wanna contribute to CNN ticker but had fever/chill/no smell or taste) for like 2 weeks and never caught it.\s\sGot first had it in like March.I've always told anyone that'd listen I'd far sooner get Covid than the jab. Unfortunately since I take about $1's worth of Ivermectin horse-paste a week alongside Zinc/D3/C (etc blah) I'm probably not getting anything except the sack ..  \sThis is fucking retarded.Buy a plane ticket to get into an international airport and just sit near a heavily trafficked area all day long.So I‚Äôve long thought having the vaccine AND getting infected would be ideal as you‚Äôd have the best of both worlds.\s\sI‚Äôm pro vaccine and got mine but I also hate the shaming being done towards those that decide not to. I have a couple close friends that decided not to (yet at least) and they are not Trumpers or conspiracy weirdos they‚Äôre normal intelligent successful people. But the narrative is that they‚Äôre troglodytes. \s\sThat‚Äôs why I find it insane that mass masking is now on the table again when vaccines are readily available to anyone. Or any other emergency measures. Delta may just build immunity in the majority of population that it becomes the last major wave and hopefully we can just live with this.\s\sI‚Äôm glad this sub is still pretty balanced and intelligent. R/nonewnormal has been taken over by some dogmatic ignorance.Yeah looks increasingly like the scenario you first mention (vaccine plus infection) is going to be exactly what happens to vaccinated people whether they want it to or not. Which is‚Äîas you say‚Äîwhy renewed masks and other NPI bullshit are more nonsensical now than they‚Äôve ever been:  this is NOT going away.  Vaccinated people will get it and many of them will die anyway because vaccines barely work in sickly elderly people‚Äîhence why that is not an age group we normally vaccinate for things.  \s\sThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen this winter:  we‚Äôre going to have another ‚Äúmass die-off‚Äù in vaccinated nursing home patients‚Ä¶because nursing home patients die every flu season.  I‚Äôm honestly not sure that when all is said and done the vaccines are going to make much visible difference at all by next spring because the same cohort most likely to die of Rona is also least likely to respond well to vaccinations.  \s\sSo this is why this my ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù and I will not go back to complying with masks and other nonsense:  they achieve nothing there is nothing left to wait for and restrictions implemented now have no exit ramp.  I‚Äôm done.  With all of it:  masks boosters distancing stay the fuck home‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done.  I have one home care client I work with one day per week whose school is requiring all students and staff wear masks and I have already promised myself this is the last ‚ÄúCovid school year‚Äù I will participate in.  If it isn‚Äôt 100% gone by next fall I will simply quit working with that client because he‚Äôs currently my only regular ‚Äúrequired masks‚Äù setting.I wouldn't call it ""better"" because that will trigger the Covidists into a foaming at the mouth rage about grandma killers plague rats and children being petri dishes but pLease tHink oF tHe cHildren!.....\s\sI would prefer to refer to it as ""the natural way"" because viruses are from nature they do what they do and sometimes sadly people don't make it - but in this case the vast majority has survived it and will survive it because of our immune systems (unless compromised then specialized specific to the case treatment is needed with a dose of a good attitude of wasting to be well).\s\sThis should have been taken on a case by case basis and kept more private between doctor and patient instead of propagandized sold for ratings and money on the media and used as a means to control a whole global population and profiteer from it by spreading fear to get people to spend more money on their products that promise ""100% Safety"".Interesting that the Beeb even entertains the idea.I've been saying this since the beginningSlightly tangential take: Having had both Covid and my second shot of Moderna two days ago I can say that the side effects of the second shot were surprisingly brutal! Worse than when I  had Covid in April 2020 it did make me muse how we had got the point where the thing that is supposed to protect you (at least in my case) made me feel worse than the thing it's protecting me from.Always has been.Astronaut: ""Always has been""I absolutely believe that it is. I am not getting a booster and will instead press onward knowing I‚Äôll get covid eventually if I haven‚Äôt already and be gtg with both natural exposure and vaccine induced exposure as well. Bring it on!Where is the cure?So: exposure>vaccination ?At least finally BBC is trying to report the truth !A surprisingly balanced and scientifically accurate article from the BBC!Honestly yes.\s\sThe fear porn may break with this article and others like it.The title of the article has changed. Now it's ""What's the best way to top up your immunity?""Dang that‚Äôs weird.  Although I will confess the original title didn‚Äôt exactly flow off the tongue; read like something created by Google translate.   That‚Äôs honestly a much better title so in this instance I don‚Äôt object ;).I think these spike protein vaccines are just going create human processing centers that will eventually churn out a variant that... doesn't use the spike. Then we're back to fearmongering about the Sigma variant or whatever and how the vaccines are useless and everyone is fucked.The spike is how it gets into cells.  No spike no infection.  It's about as likely as a duck turning into a badger.The answer doesn't matter I'd rather be free or die if that's what this deadly evil wicked 0.24% deathrate sniffle is really going to do to me.Got my antibody test this morning.

More shift in the narrative that while infuriating is helpful to ‚Äúour team.‚ÄùThis is fairly poor English.To keep in mind the true way to get herd immunity is to get and beat the 'rona this will give the person long-lasting immunity in both antibodies and t-cell immunity!Oh my gawwwwwwd. \s\sI honestly can‚Äôt with this fuckery anymore.[deleted]Did you even read the article?  This is referring to catching Covid AFTER being vaccinated and if that is preferable to endless boosters.  Essentially it‚Äôs saying once the vaccine that targets a very specific spike protein has ‚Äútaken the edge off‚Äù is it better to subsequently enhance immunity against *the entire virus* via actual exposure.  That‚Äôs not a remotely ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù proposal.  \s\sAnd for the love can we stop with the ‚Äúask people on ventilators‚Äù rhetoric?  It‚Äôs so so old.  If a fully vaccinated person STILL ends up on a ventilator then a *third* (or fourth or fifth) dose of the same exact stuff isn‚Äôt going to change anything for them.When did this sub turn from lockdown skepticism to vaccine denial? The vaccines reduce transmission and damage from COVID-19 and self isolation when infected will continue to pressure the virus to mutate less and less deadly. This is endemic but refusing to get a vaccine at this point is absurd. We've known how good vaccines are for over a hundred years now.Had to make this exact same point earlier:  read the article before you comment.  This is NOT an ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù article.  It is not talking about not vaccinating *at all*.  The point they‚Äôre presenting is whether *once a person has been vaccinated and that has ‚Äútaken the edge off‚Äù is it THEN better for them to acquire further immunity via exposure to the whole virus instead of only the spike protein?  Basically they propose that letting *vaccinated* people develop natural immunity IN ADDITION would be better than constant boosters.  \s\sThe point is important as we are seeing that neither vaccination nor natural infection confers permanent or sterilizing immunity so we‚Äôre going to have to do one or the other.  Everyone is going to get Covid likely multiple times.  The first round of vaccines have equipped people‚Äôs immune systems to the point that it may very well be more beneficial for them to now encounter Covid ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù as a more mild infection that naturally ‚Äúboosters‚Äù their immune system to the *entire virus* rather than just a spike protein.\s\sSeriously don‚Äôt write a comment after reading nothing but the headline; you miss a LOT of important context.The authorities at certainly taking advantage of the fear they're helping to createCan't access the full articleHere you go: https://archive.vn/PSTXzStill insisting on calling it the CCP virus at this point really discredits this publication. I feel like I'm stepping into an alternate-reality cult that is as detached as the covidian one.\s\sThe worst part is they make it sound as if this Yale Epidemologist is saying that. Really disgusting journalism.The Epoch Times is an *extremely* questionable source. They hate the CCP above everything else so everything they do is about discrediting China and the CCP.The epoch times is owned by the publishing arm of Falun Dafa just so you know.

Social distancing doesn't end it. Masking doesn't end it.  Vaccination doesn't end it. Segregation doesn't end it.\s\s""Can we get serious now?""[deleted]Yep. If this didn't do it that to me is the final word. There's no chance in hell of it all working in other locations. \s\sOnly way out is through.<<The rise in cases described by government as *exponential...>>*\s\sAh nostalgia.I was so much older then I'm younger than that now.News like this provides absolutely no incentive to get the vaccine or the boosters.  Nothing is good enough to be ""safe"".  Even after 6 boosters they'll still have lockdowns and ""surging cases"".  These restrictions don't help anything and they know it.  It's just about authoritarianism point blank.The world never has been and never will be safe. So if ""safe"" is our standard to just live our lives normally there will always be something unsafe to hold us back. That's been my main objection to all this nonsense from the start: who determines what ""safe"" is? And once we've set the precedent that something unsafe can shut down our lives we will never ever go back to normal because things are always unsafe to some extent.Well they help Big Pharma to make $billions.The incentive in Europe is to get the QR code or else be excluded from non essential activitiesAll restrictions should be abolished.\sPeople are vaxxed for that.\sThe mask is an evil that destroy human natureso it must be replaced by vaccine.Lol\sThe most vaccinated places are the countries that enacted the strictest mandates and will probably continue being the strictest going forwardsWe cannot comply our way out of tyranny. This is pure bullying plain and simple.People need to really look at this and understand it. Gibraltar to our knowledge is the best test case scenario for complete vaccination. Like the article says--100% + everyone coming in and out of the country. It is a tiny area and is now averaging 67 new cases per day with a population of 33000. Extrapolated to the US population that would be the equivalent of 670000 new cases per day--well more than double the highest amount we've ever recorded in a single day.\s\sSo...do we still consider unvaccinated the dirty lepers? How can you possibly make that argument in the face of numbers like this? In a near perfect test scenario the case counts are double the worst numbers of the pandemic ever measured anywhere.Amazing vaccines these are....back in my day they were called immunizations.> Gibraltar‚Äôs entire eligible population is vaccinated.\s\sSorry calling bullshit on this one. *Obviously* there‚Äôs still at least one dirty unvaccinated lurking among them. Now if they can just find a way to root that guy out and *deal with him* the virtuous will finally be able to get back to normal.\s\sHow might they do this? Well we obviously know that anti-vaxxers are all quacks or followers of quacks. What *also* quacks? That‚Äôs right. Ducks. Thus if an individual suspected of being one of The Unclean weighs as much as a duck‚Ä¶‚Ä¶He‚Äôs made of wood.lol yeah everyone hates Jared the loner who never finished high school and secretly mines bitcoin in his mother's basement. They'll burn him in the town square as a sacrifice and then return to normal.Safe and effective? Do we in the US have any reason to believe that a 100% vaccination rate will turn out better than it did for Gibraltar?My county waits for 80 percent of total population to be fully vaccinated to start thinking about removing the mask mandate‚Ä¶Effective at generating revenue yes. Please call it a shot though vaccine was an extremely generous term used for marketing its definition has therefore been modified to support the implication of immunization.  The flu shot is also now being called a vaccine.  Compare an old printed dictionary to Googles definition and you'll see what I mean.pfizer stock ticker go up>Gibraltar‚Äôs entire adult population has been fully vaccinated since March and masks are still required in shops and on public transport.¬†\s\sJFC. 100%  vaccinated  since March and still masked 9 months later. \s\sWhats the fucking point then?Give it a rest already![removed]At least not in the way they told us they would.When we vaxxed small pox we could isolated small pox. This is the flu and all its different types and the vax suppresses your bodies ability to fight it with symptoms that are inconvenient. \s\sYeeeeee clown land yeeeeeeeThey have to vaccinate all the monkeysEvery article I have read about this is ""urging people to get their boosters""...........the fuck.....why? Because the first doses are working so well?You thought Gibraltar residents were vaccinated? You fool! Only 40% are \*really\* vaccinated according to the definition of ""vaccinated"" which is and has always been one shot every six months.I'm beginning to think someone or a group of people want to ban holidays altogether.

The data is actually good they have to forget cases.[deleted]And when you do have the tiniest protests for more mandates which have like 5 or so people the media NONSTOP covers it whilst downplaying the anti-mandate protests.  Absolutely infuriatingI'm surrounded by people who don't understand why mandates are bad. I tell them that and I get blank stares. They don't seem to understand that being anti mandate is not the same as being anti vaxx. But that forced mandates will actually make people less willing to vaccinate. Their response is that people just don't care about other people. The irony in their argument is lost on themJust compare it to bananas.

Seems I'm in the wrong business again.Can I put these on a vaccine card to get food I need to survive or do I still need forty booster shots?This is what you get with textbook fascism. Merging business and state was never going to be a good thing.Yet another example why this is about money and control.  If drug manufactures and the public were generally concerned about pandemic and the world population then these drugs and the ingredients to make them would be shared and at minimum cost.I'm not a fan of Covid drug subscriptions generally but it's perfectly normal for a medication to be sold for way more than it costs to make. The company has to develop and test a bunch of other drugs that never make it to market which are subsidized by the few that do get approved. \s\sAlso the cost of producing the actual pill is almost nothing compared to the development cost which is why generics are so much cheaper and still highly profitable.Fair point.  But if you read the article it seems that the initial research was government-funded.  Then the results and rights were bought by some company (which sounds very like an intermediary set up to trade exactly these IP assets) which then sold them to Merck.  So there is at least a good case that no matter the subsequent development and licensing costs borne by Merck the public purse has or should have some property rights in the result.  I'm not saying 100% control.  Just some.  But this is entering into pharma-politics which (as your comment indicates) is deeply complicated.\s\sOne thing is certain: if Merck claim that they're doing us all a great favour they're lying.  They will of course.Yeah this is a stupid populist headline.\s\sTell us the profit they're making instead all costs considered. That'd be useful.\s\sOtherwise might as well also publish ""iPhone sold for 1000x what the silicon and metal in it cost""That's true but many drug companies spend way more on dividends stock buybacks and lobbying than actual research and development. And that's besides for the fact that a lot of the research is government funded. The drug companies that are making money are way more money than is needed to incentivise development of drugs and the high cost of drugs which happens as a result is very harmful to vulnerable populations.How much does the IPhone cost to manufacture?About $500. I read the actual amount the other day. I was surprised.In other words : water is wet.Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.Cheaper than the mono abs but hey we're trying to save money...uhh I mean save lives...jk we're trying to save money even though we print as much as we want.  Makes sense? sureThis is like when scientific research is financed with YOUR taxpayer money but only available if you again pay for a subscription to the journal in which it is published. Not right.Couldn‚Äôt just sell it at cost for the public good could they?Damn. If only there were a way to recover from Covid without this drug.\s\sOh wait it's called resting getting plenty of fluids and taking flu meds to reduce symptoms.So?I mean I can certainly see a case being made that this is just capitalism at work so it is what it is.\s\sThe issues I personally have with this are:\s\s1- contradictory messaging.  We are being beaten over the head with the idea that COVID is the plague that everything we knew about how society works flew out the window because were iN a PaNdEmIc.  Testing was made free at point of service ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù.  Financial support was offered to people who had to quarantine ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù.  Vaccines (which surely cost a hell of a lot more to develop) were made free at the point of service ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù.  So why is this therapeutic not also being made free?  Would it not be in the interest of the greater good to treat sick people so that they can more quickly recover from this so-called deadly virus that we had to turn society inside-out over?\s\s2- If this virus is indeed hitting poor/low-income people harder as the news media talking heads like to espouse does this markup not price out the people who most need access to the drug?\s\s3- why is it that *every* form of preventative or active treatment other than mRNA vaccines is somehow thwarted?  Whether it‚Äôs discredited buried or made exorbitantly expensive one thing is glaringly obvious- there is a focused organized push for vaccines and other therapeutics that could *actually* save lives are being tossed in the scrap heap to keep the vaccine propaganda train running.'Government financed' was less than 1pt of r&d for this. For every medicine that makes it to market there are 20 that fail. Each failure is about $1 billion down the drain. That means medicines have to have a large markup for innovation to exist at all. This medicine will help people (vaxxed and unvaxxed) survive COVID and help make lockdowns obsolete. Let's not join the government in trying to demonize pharmaceutical interventions (like they did with Ivermectin) to push their Vax agenda and actual support the brave scientists who helped make this. This medicine helps everyone.>and help make lockdowns obsolete.\s\s I've seen this one!>brave scientists\s\stfEvery drug developed in the past decade got its start by NIH and related government agency research. Innovation isn't coming from big pharma since the kind of research done at the NIH isn't profitable. They are pretty innovative in patent manipulation though I'll give you that.It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt work. They are not in the business of creating solutions. If they followed the power they would make Covid worse because it trumps all gods governments and individuals.

In my experience most of these people have been like this their whole lives. This has just given them a platform and concentrated their issues. These are the people that cause problems at work cause something 'makes them uncomfortable or feel unsafe' the ones that write letters to local councils to complain about children being loud people partying etc etc. They are the dementors of society and we'd be better off if they all stayed inside forever.Let's kill more people via suicides!\s\sLet's enable more domestic violence!\s\sLet's ignore the economic medical and social consequences!What can you even say at this point.

Now he is petrified.\s\sI personally think - and I doubt very much that this will happen but nonetheless - that it is long overdue for governments to come clean about whatever brainwashing techniques they used to scare people shitless into complying with lockdowns back in Mar. 2020. Only once that happens can we figure out how to ease back into real normality.If you haven‚Äôt come across it yet there is a book which summarises this quite well called ‚ÄúA state of fear‚Äù by Laura Dodsworth. \s\sIt shouldn‚Äôt be important but Laura Dodsworth is better known for her series ‚Äúbare realities‚Äù which is a very different subject matter but was getting 5* reviews back in 2019 from publications like the guardian. i.e. she is not exactly some alt-right fanatic.\s\s""I guess more charitably what this demonstrates is the seriousness of what has been done to people's minds. This was probably a normal guy once. Now he is petrified.""\s\sIMO this paragraph is everything.When I see this it just makes me think that these are people who have difficulty socializing and have been made to feel weird about that their whole life and now they feel validated by being in their comfort zone but they want others to do it too to make *sure* they‚Äôre not weird....that in fact being socially awkward is the norm.\s\sBut that‚Äôs a lot for people who aren‚Äôt tossing around the ‚Äúwe‚Äù this and the ‚Äúus‚Äù that due to lacking partner/family privilege.\s\sI‚Äôve seen codependent couples break up during this who went from congratulating themselves on a smug hunkering down and being up ‚Äúeach other‚Äù‚Äôs asses to suddenly hitting up those dating apps *real* fast and bending all their former rules about closeness with strangers because the loneliness and skin hunger became unbearable. Funny how avoiding celibacy (sex being the least socially distant you can be to another body) becomes an exception in this supposedly live-or-die situation.I have to say this might actually be my favorite comment on anything so far in all of these subs.Yeah because the first round of lockdowns were obviously so effective.  What a fucking dunce.Your username omg üòÜPretty sure my kid has covid right now. Low grade fever for days and some coughing but he seems to be in good spirits.\s\sI have no idea where he got it and I don't care. I live in the Bay Area where most people wear masks and are vaccinated as well.\s\sMaybe if I had just been a good parent and chained  him in a dungeon he'd never have gotten sick. Or welded him inside a metal shipping container.This is the right attitude. Hell I'm pretty sure *I* have covid right now. Couple days of fever and lots of sneezing followed by low grade fever and stuffiness that comes back at night. I don't give the slightest crap where I may have caught it from and I'm certainly not pissed off at anyone for having caught this maybe-covid but if I had to guess I probably caught it in the airport while wearing a mask.Ahhhh lockdown the whole country until Pfizer puts another booster in us.\s\sRinse and repeat forever; at least the Spanish Flu actually ended.All doomers like this need to be relentlessly shunned and ridiculed until they sit down and shut the fuck up.Yet we don't do that we just keep giving them a platform.Seems the ""Vaccinated"" need a lockdown to protect the rest of us \s\sNow we have the ""Delta Plus""Delta plus only scares the Delta minuses.I‚Äôm going to Put in Bay and partying it up maskless next weekend. Sucks to suck loserOK then go ahead and stay home. Shut your business down or quit your job and stay home. Simple. Oh but that would be taking on personal responsibility and that's a dirty phrase in today's world. It's better to get the government to force everyone to do the same the willing and unwilling alike.Wrong! That's precisely the wrong reaction to that scenario! That scenario should underscore the absolute futility of our ""covid response."" Seriously! Doing jack shit would have been better. You're vaccinated and you still got covid. You got covid and you're still well enough to take dumb pictures of yourself for this article. If I'm really sick I can barely walk to the bathroom let alone worry about this bullshit. Open up completely with no restrictions live your life and STOP giving a flying F. \s\sIn the words of Twitter-banned anti-cannabis overall-jackass-but-makes-good-points-on-Covid guy-I-can't-believe-I'm-quoting Alex Berenson......\s\s......""virus gonna virus.""100% agree with most of this but Berenson isn't anti-cannabis he just points out negative things about it.They could just lockdown themselves but it's not about health so that doesn't suffice for them.‚ÄòMany would consider a statewide arson attack on all private property to be a political inconvenience. As someone with an ant infestation in their living room I disagree‚Äô.ü§£ü§£üëèüëèüëèArchive link:  https://archive.vn/6aLqII'm losing my mind reading this he literally said he and his family had mild symptoms but lockdowns are needed because ""we still caught it"".              \s> At this point it feels like Fauci and the Biden administration are ignoring the science for political reasons.                \s               \s""Ignoring the science"" lmao.thanks...just read it what an idiot. Is the Walmart at home Covid test the new gold standard?I think it's clear that *he* needs another lockdown - in a padded room far away from any WiFi.FYI:  \s\sLast week 8 people I personally know were positive and symptomatic with Covid.  ALL were vaccinated. 2 of them I have never seen without a mask for 6 months.\s\sI spoke with someone who works in HR and 20 people from her work called in positive with Covid.  All were vaccinated.\s\sThese ain't breakthrough cases folks...but hopefully the people who are positive might now have full immunity.It's a Corona virus you will get it again it's like flu damit! Have the annual booster if you're desperate but imo you're too young to worryWhat an entitled one dimensional out of touch way to think about reality... this sort of nonsense noise makes my blood boil. There are so many issues with the argument being made here it‚Äôs unbelievable. No wonder it‚Äôs questioned as satire.Oh no! They got a cold! The horror!He's advocating another lockdown because he has a cold.\s\sI seriously wonder what would the world look like right now if Covid-19 was actually just a cold and the common cold had never existed before. If people had virtually no chance of dying or going to the hospital but for the first time in their lives they experienced a runny nose and sore throat for a week would people still be this insane?I will gladly weld these people inside their homes so they don‚Äôt ever again have to expose themselves to me. And then I will continue to live my life as I see fit üëçüèªSo cringeWhat an idiotHe can lock himself down if he wants that's cool. Just leave everyone else who doesn't agree alone. If he's so sick shouldn't he be in bed instead of taking selfies and writing clickbait?Was this guy expecting the vaccine to be a magic force field or what? The vaccines we have are very good but far from perfect. Some fully vaxxed people will still get a little bit sick and that's okay.I think some publications just publish this crap for the LOLZ. Everyone is a troll these day's.Grrr...  That's exactly how immunity works you dumbass.  You aren't granted total invulnerability to the virus.  You will get sick but the symptoms will be much milder and you won't require a trip to the hospital or a stay in their ICU.  If you're genetically blessed then you might even shrug it off without even so much as a sniffle.This article is the real misinformation. This guy was under the impression that Vaccine = No Illness ever again and his response to getting sick again is to beg for lock down.Wait...let me guess (could only read the first paragraph before getting locked out)...got Covid despite being vaccinated and instead of blaming the now proven low efficacy of the vaccine...he blames the unvaxxed ü§∑ü§¶I see mental illness is hereditary.[removed]Wth? Do you have a source for any of this?they should just have a central air system that circulates bleach vapor all throughout the house to kill the covid while they lockdown at homeLike fuck we do not.
