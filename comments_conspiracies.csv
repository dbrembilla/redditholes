One in Germany and one in the grand canyon that was on the floor of the GC for over 2000 years. The last one was a arrow shape craft that crashes years ago and someone took the back half of the ship. Prob the engine and left the rest of the as a wreck. I can't find where I read the translation but it's out on the internet. Oh he mentioned some skeleton body's at one crash and another with no trace but claims the aliens in the grad canyon one prob lived with the natives. Happy searching.Check out Skinwalker ranch.

It‚Äôs a good oneThere have been multiple attempts at offering millions to anyone who could prove scientifically they have these abilities... and every single one has failed.\s\sIf it is true... it would had been proven.Oh brother. Read the gateway report. Literally any mystical faculty humans can conceptualize seems to show efficacy.Also even if it did make those claims id be tempted to just interpret this as ‚ÄúThe CIA is fucking stupid and thinks psychic abilities are real lmao.‚ÄùRussel Targ worked with and trained the CIA folks way back when. he wrote a pretty cool book about it and has a Ted talk too. It was interesting. Some of his stuff is a bit out there but also keep in mind he sounded like a pretty accomplished physicist. He worked on lasers etc and a few labs. He tends to back up claims with research and offers his own quasi reasonable explanation or theory he has about how a phenomenon he found works.I had the pleasure of attending an RV workshop with RUssel Targ.   It was personally pretty mindblowing.Just watched this presentation on physicist Russel Targ‚Äôs research and experiments with ESP for the CIA yesterday!\s\sVery cool to listen to although in this talk he doesn‚Äôt really say anything about any explanations for the ESP or RV phenomenon just gives examples of experiments that show it‚Äôs a real thing that happens. They apparently just don‚Äôt know how it works yet but tests show it‚Äôs real. Here‚Äôs that link:\s\sBanned TEDTalk about Psychic Abilities | Russell Targ | suespeaks.org\shttps://youtu.be/hBl0cwyn5GYThere‚Äôs a great documentary on Prime Video called ‚ÄúThird Eye Spies‚ÄùI‚Äôm going to check this out. ThanksLike I‚Äôd trust the CIA to do anything right except run drugs.and topple governments.Bet they seen this one coming.They already saw what you did there.Russel Targ- remote viewingYep... it's called the Gateway experience. You can find the actual documents and transcripts from the CIA website. Here's one of them:https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210016-5That doesn't say anything useful.project jediFor nothing but cold hard FACTS I always turn to MEDIUM.COM.theyve known this semi-publicly since the 80s.Earlier. RV was being used for cold war intelligence gathering by the Russians if you believe it's a real thing. Apparently our Govt. did.They are a primal trait before we could communicate with words. Dormant and when they are active they are a splinter in a thought. It‚Äôs like trying to find a unique singular grain of sand on the beachfront coast line.I thought this was all just junk they made up to trick the Russians into pouring money and time into pointless research? That's what I heard anyway.\s\sI mean I believe in Psychic abilities but not to the extent that they can be weaponized by the military industrial complex. They serve a different purpose and anyone with them will have a very bad time if they try to use them for harm.The problem they have is that for clairvoyance to work the human being needs to develop themselves their whole selves (body soul and spirit) to attain a reliable level of mastery. They can't do this because any human being that does the work necessary to achieve this level probably didn't do it under the watchful eye of the CIA.\s\sThat is why they hijack all other groups (American Theosophy for example) that claim to be able to achieve what they want. And if they are using their clairvoyant power for personal gain they will be misguided by the spirit world. It is extremely hard to find truth in the spirit world and the only way to be sure of discoveries in that world is to have moved forward ethically and morally as an individual. Black magik is always tainted with personal ego and greed and will work in a crude fashion but of course it swings back and bites them in the ass. I bet they have learned that lesson quite well by now.I‚Äôve recently finished Annie Jacobsen‚Äôs Phenomena which delves into this area in good detail. If anyone is interested in finding out more about how TK and ESP were developed and some of the let‚Äôs say.. unique approaches to its applications; then I highly recommend it.this book is really good and i need to reread it. that said in her Area 51 book she also claims that Roswell was a soviet experiment to try and infiltrate American air space. while i don't think she's being disingenuous she's one of those authors who ""wants to believe"" just as much as we do and therefore anything that isn't declassified/verifiable shouldn't be taken as concrete evidence of anything but instead a bread crumb to do your own research and come to your own conclusions. otherwise love ms. jacobson despite her semi-reputation among normies of being a crank.Heisenberg's uncertainty principleI dont know why youve gotten downvotes.... \s\sI've wondered myself if this comes into play.   To expand that theory: if a large population of consciousnesses hold a common belief system does that belief then manifest in some way?To meth or not to meth? /sYes I‚Äôve also read Area 51 and whilst I enjoyed the content around the developed of the Oxcart program I have to say that the whole ‚Äúblack propaganda‚Äù tale of medical experiments and flying saucers was a little hard to swallow. She has proven herself to be a tenacious researcher and I certainly feel she should be given more respect for the information she‚Äôs managed to collage. I‚Äôve got Operation Paperclip slated as my next read from her looking forward to it.I don't believe it for a second.I always feel sad for people that dismiss the right-brain strenghts in humans.  The idea that the left-brain serves as a filter of logic for the right brain it would seem that some attributes of the right-brain instinctual emotional 'animal' attributes could be overlooked by too strong a left-brain function for some folks?Have you ever tried prediction or remote viewing yourself?

Not sure which is funnier‚Ä¶I'm still convinced our ""conciousness"" is just the aware end of a filter and that there are a bunch of other small sub consciousness' going on one or more which are telepathic in nature.[deleted]I read a while back this happened in movie theaters.Jacobo Grinberg a neurophysiologist at the University of Mexico also did experiments regarding the transfer of information non locally from person to person with the implication that all consciousness is connected.non locally as in they were in their houses or diff parts of the country or something?Does this have anything to do with spontaneous synchronizationSynchronisation of weakly coupled oscillators! Could definitely see brains or consciousness in that way.How they sync may not be what we think though but maybe a pathway beyond our current thinking. \s\sBut when we do the same things our brains might use the same parts others do to complete a task. Those who think and are similar ‚Äúminded‚Äù people.Being on the freeway moving at 90 mph and everything is standing still‚Ä¶ glance over at the guy next to me and he‚Äôs singing the same song on the radio station I‚Äôm listening too‚Ä¶ a river of dinosaur blood flows through our cars high fructose water in our belly‚Ä¶ we are all in synchronized chaos it‚Äôs beautiful‚Ä¶You do realize that petroleum products aren‚Äôt actually made from dinosaurs right?Is this why I never seem to feel included/in sync with other people? Are we incompatible and we just can't understand each other properly.You might be an Apple in a PC world.You needa find ur tribe my guy they're out there and probably into the same hobbies you areThis is fascinatingThis is so interesting! Thanks for sharing.Ishtak Bentov's ""Stalking the wild pendulum"" explores this phenomena as well as other aspects of consciousness great book.  He posits that we all emit EM in the same way wires emir EM at right angle to election (or hole) flow and this induces current (sympathetic) in those we are close to.  That and a fair amount of wave propagation and interference patterns round out his theory as it relates to shared thoughts. Brilliant man.energy is what we are then>Neuroscientists needed to rule out the possibility that this neural synchronization occurred due to a shared environment similarities in sensory input (what people could see hear smell) or in motor output (how they moved their bodies).\s\sRemember kids correlation is not causation. And not everything that's unexplained is paranormal.And water is wet thanks. Given that this is a scientific study nothing paranormal is being suggested here.\s\sOn the other hand what is interesting is that a complex systems theory of consciousness has the odd side effect that locating consciousness purely in the brain isn't necessary and that could have effects that further study could uncover.\s\sOr you know just sneer at anything that isn't the generally held purely dualistic ghost-in-the-machine model of consciousness that hasn't ever been philosophically or scientifically logical.This seems rather obvious. If people are in the same environment and talking about the same stuff it seems rather obvious their brain waves would sync. They both sync to the shared causation thereby correlating with each otherLol thanks for these great words you‚Äôve assembled. Does the possibility it is paranorm make you uncomfortable.\s\swhat part of the scientific method is ridicule.Yes but all causation is correlatedPersonally it amazes me how the menstrual periods of women who live or work in groups eventually synchronize especially when they work together in confined spaces such as an little office or classroomthats a mythThen I suppose it would be appropriate to describe people with autism or aspergers as having brains that don't sync.Maybe they sync in different ways more or fewer ways with ‚Äòneurotypical‚Äô people;     \s.. or only sync with other people running at their same.. uh.. ‚Äúlevels‚Äù for lack of a better word.If only I had a better receiver installed. I don't get enough stations on this thinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDhlOovaGrIRed silhouette on the right and blue on the left I see what you did there.Could explain a few thingsConsciousness is a fieldA couple of months ago I had a very normal dream (nothing strange or awkward about it that is) where a good friend of mine told me that his wife was pregnant. We had talked about the possibility of them trying at some point a few times but that issue had not been a topic of conversation for several months at this point. I thought it was such a strange and random thing to dream about that I told him about it. When I told him about the dream he didn't say too much about it...just said ""*That is very strange*"" or something similar. At the time I did not notice him having any strange reactions to me mentioning my dream. Well a few weeks ago he broke the news to me that they were in fact expecting a child.\s\sThe crazy part was...he said ""*Do you remember a couple of months ago when you told me about your dream? We had just found out she was pregnant about 2 days prior to that!*""\s\sThere was only one plausible explanation I could possibly think of. Obviously when one finds out they are going to be a parent that concept completely dominates your thoughts for quite some time. The ONLY thing I could think of was that he was putting so much energy into thinking about it and was putting that energy out into the universe and I somehow subconsciously picked up on it and I just knew what was going on. He said it really freaked him out when I mentioned the dream but he didn't say anything at the time because it was so early in the pregnancy and they wanted to get further along before telling anyone.\s\sEither way we spend a lot of time together and I personally believe that we are synched to a certain degree and he subconsciously and unintentionally ""told"" me what was going on. This world is a wild wild place.I had a best friend through high school and after where we were inseparable. It was a very happy and healthy friendship. Over time it definitely felt like like her and I were starting to have our consciousness join together. \s\sWe got on a hallucinogenic adventure and used them every so often. We synced our watches to the second (usually when we were apart at that moment) knowing they'd kick in the perfect time once we came together. \s\sWe ended up sharing hallucinations constantly. Also thoughts and feelings. And not just ""it's cold"" .. ""whoa I'm cold too!"" type thoughts and feelings. Completely obscure random things at precisely the exact moment as each other. Our perception of things around us in all states became almost the same. \s\sI know how types of shared coincidental thoughts can become common amongst people who spend lots of time together like spouses. My parents do it. What my friend and I experienced wasn't like that though. It sometimes felt like there was something silently communicating between us. A link somewhere like a tether between us that grew one day unbeknownst to us. A little extra connection that formed. It was a wild ride.Merging minds and consciousness‚Ä¶ for sure.\s\sDid you ever have any telepathic experiences with her?   Perhaps where you were apart but ‚Äòknew‚Äô something about the other one‚Äôs situation that was confirmed later?Oh rrly?\s\sPeople have ""vibed"" and ""synched"" since humans built fires.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sTry again doctor guy humans have behaved this way for generations.But now he‚Äôs proved it with a lab coat![deleted]I'm not into dosh I hate money I *loathe* possessions. It''s just so...crypto-fascist!Good stuffOn acid your mind literally connects with other people to the point that they can say only a couple of words that don‚Äôt make sense to the average person but the tripping person will know exactly what the other person is saying. It‚Äôs a crazy experience and I‚Äôve had multiple people who I‚Äôve met that have said the same thing happened to them.This synchronization may well be the explanation for the experience of a ‚Äúcontact high‚Äù when a sober friend is present with a few others who are flying on the same substance and the sober friend starts to feel ‚Äòlifted‚Äô in the same ways they are.\s\sAnd possibly how friends & partners can ‚Äòsense‚Äô or ‚Äòknow‚Äô or ‚Äòshare‚Äô information with each other irregardless of distance syncing up at the same moment.   Partly enabled by experiences of syncing empathetically / cooperatively when physically together and developing a deep familiarity with each other‚Äôs patterns.      \s  Just a hypothesis.\s\sThe ‚Äòextension of consciousness‚Äô idea has been expressed by others from a different angle:  \s\sWhen using a tool such as chopsticks a fork or a pencil‚Ä¶ you can notice that your attention and awareness moves *to the instrument itself*.       \s.  You don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhow‚Äù to write a character with the pencil or even ‚Äúhow‚Äù your hand needs to move  you think ‚Äòas‚Äô the pencil simply knowing where the tip needs to flow to complete the letters you are writing or shapes you are drawing.\s\sThis suggests that using attention awareness & perhaps a little bit of imagination we can ‚Äòput‚Äô our consciousness in other locations:  the tines of a fork  the tip of the screwdriver turning a screw  the edge of your kitchen knife as you cut vegetables.   \s\sAnd perhaps further afield.Could might...so it's nothing.This wouldn‚Äôt be surprising imo. Obviously it seems humans produce some level of electrical activity that would effect the ether in some way if even only small ripples. It‚Äôs also easy to assume that these ripples could be absorbed and effect the background noise of the brain in some way.\s\sSo I think it‚Äôs a reasonable hypothesis to think they could form a harmonious feed back system.\s\sWhile it might sound unreasonable. It‚Äôs seems just as unreasonable to dismiss it as pure nonsense.Does that explain why people have the ability to ‚Äúread minds‚Äù??? I‚Äôve always looked at it as more of a sync between the two subjects allowing one individual to ‚Äúhear‚Äù from the others subconscious before the other individual has the chance to say it. It‚Äôs telepathic communication it just appears to us like some form of super power due to the fact 99.999999% of the time we use some form of spoken/written languageSort of I guess... funny to look at considering this sort of thing being existing for a long time.\s\sLOL funny the way they then say ""give up consciousness does not exist"" stupid. No. Consciousness objectively exists. So then I think it's just as valid as saying ""ok you are an unconscious person"" lmao oh so it's possibly true? Like how some papers cooked up this to say it was?\s\sEdit: it probably stands higher now though that you have articles actively broken by journalists saying things like: consciousness does not exist. Then a companies actively promoting this fraud too. Along with journalist writers... really really scum.On a salvia trip a few years ago with a buddy of mine we were laying on the couch and our shoulders touched and we both described the same visual and emotional experience it was literally like we were morphing into one conscious being.**Strangers**: Read the rules and understand the sub topics listed in the sidebar closely before posting or commenting.

And before you beat me up are you prepared to believe the spaceship also rained hellfire on the text below?Love the comment section community.Yeah I didn't pay much attention to the stains because it's super much clear for me this is just from rust or damage these things happen to paintings after some time. But for the heck of it these flying THINGS motifs are so weird...The disk looks like a rondel on a 15th century cuirass and pauldronsWhat do you think about the ufo thing. It looks like some sort of portal and a face with a nose looking out of the portal. Lol. I really do see It.Looks like smoke billowing out""Clearly"".Yea...a good post ruined by his shitty personal statement.text underneath is german psalm 130.7 ""israel hoffe auf den herrn"" which is translated to ""O Israel hope in the Lord""  \s\s\sdon't seem to be directly connected but maybe of interest.definitely interesting...thanks for the infoJust a weird thought but..\s\sWhat if disk-shaped ufo theories were actually inspired by these paintings rather than the painting being evidence of ufos?\s\sLike what if angels were depicted like weird otherworldly disk object things for a long time before they changed it up and started painting humanoid angels and the baby cherub things. Then later on people forgot the connection or people from outside the religion/culture interpreted them differently thus creating an idea/theory of flying disk objects without proper explanation or background. Then people began seeing (or imagining) flying saucers just like many claim to see angels/demons/ghosts/etc. Then someone came along* in the early years of aviation and actual* flying machines and created/solidified the modern idea of flying disks into the sci-fi alien vehicles we picture today.\s\sNot trying to argue or disprove or anything. Just some thoughts I had while looking at this[deleted]I know what sub this is and I dont want to be too critical because we're supposed to be open to possibilities and all that.\s\sBut that red stuff is damage due to age and the UFO is meant to be like a representation of an angel or chariot of god type thing.Is it noteworthy that a common classical artistic representation of a godly chariot so closely resembles the modern observed UFO phenomena?[removed]a chariot that doesnt look anything like a chariot....How do you know what the UFO is meant to represent ? Could it mean it represents a UFO ? wtf. An angel or chariot lolIt definitely appears to be decay related damage OP was overdoing it with that interpretation.\s\sAs for the object unless some art major has some revelatory explanation of what it actually represents then it literally is a depiction of a UFO (it's unidentified and it's in the sky).\s\sIf it is meant to represent an angel or some heavenly event then it is curious how much it does resemble modern descriptions of UFO's (it even seems to have a trail or plume of smoke attached to it).\s\sIn saying  that without more info about the painting it's all idle speculation.Honestly I wish most users of this sub would think more critically before and after posting to it.\s\sWe barely see any proper strangeness just stuff that can be or has been explained or debunked.Not saying it was aliens but clearly its aliensYou forgot the hairLooks to me crashing into a church. Looks like its on fire to or upside down. Or it has a smoke stack for a boiler?And from the bible I give you  [Ezekiel 1:4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin19zki_3rAhUKNOwKHSO1AFoQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fezekiel%2F1-4.htm&usg=AOvVaw0Vn7l6ypsbTSQ5ZlJrG_mp)\s\sA rather stunning thing to find in that book.annoying people were drawn as snails in european medieval times. You know there was a certain picture language used. But for the heck of it I can't find anything about what these THINGS IN THE SKY could mean. Maybe some holy shine from angels or the sun but ffff they look SO much like flying saucers.Because you look at them with eyes and mind of 2020. Back then they didn't had movies and popculture to ""know"" what a spaceship is supposed to look. But they had the bible. And the bible gave them the must fucked up angel description you'll ever read.It looks like it is shielding the church from a meteorite.I second this. I think it‚Äôs meant to portray a stylized shield protecting/saving a church from lightning or maybe a meteor. Shields were most likely a more common sight and reference point for people in the Middle Ages. Our 21st century eyes think ‚ÄúFlying Saucer‚Äù - a 16th century church goer would recognize the object as a shield.This resembles a similar depiction on a French coin from the same time period. https://images.app.goo.gl/uXXR3uTAQHqkGzwZ7 \sAnother example:\shttps://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/03/20/31D1DFB000000578-0-image-a-10_1457038614429.jpg This one has been suggested to be Ezekiel‚Äôs wheel but compared to the first coin I‚Äôd say they are all shields. One can basically argue a flying saucer and shield are the same thing.Maybe their word for ""vehicle"" WAS ""chariot"" - that would make a lot of sense to me.Looks like it depicts a UFO crashing into a church. Would be really interesting if there was anything documenting that.\s\sEdit: past this of course being obvious documentation as in something in writing like a narrative.Why is everyone focusing on the on fire thing. OP obviously looked at it and saw something else initially. That absolutely does not take away from the fact that this is a painting from hundreds of years ago depicting a church and UFO connection. If people stopped wanting to be ‚Äúright‚Äù they might actually see the big picture now and thenYep. It's called nitpicking. The fact that artists one day up and decided to represent god/angles/chariots as flying metallic discs should be of high interest considering the historical and modern contexts of sky beings and flying machines.Ah the sixteenth century UFO's had such wonderful lines and classic styling... /sYou guys should join this discord server.

If you want to I can ask my family about it they come from around there.[deleted]Probably Ezekiel‚Äôs wheel in the sky from the bible.Someone should carbon date the paint. I wouldn't put it past the elites to re-write history and include aliens just for shits and giggles.That's a weather balloonThere's also this painting of Madonna with children in Pallazo Vecchio Florence that shows a UFO in the background and someone watching it and pointing towards it. \s\s\s[ufo Madonna painting ](http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/03/04/a-ufo-in-palazzo-vecchio/)Setting fire or coming down to save it?That UFO looks a lot like a trencher. A trencher is the bread they used to bake to use as a plate. Sopped up all the drippings and you'd feed it to the dogs. This is just an observation. The artist was probably familiar with that bread and used it as a reference.The UFO looks like the Living Alien Ship from Encounter at Farpoint. \s\sAssuming that it is a UFO and  assuming the church is on fire one could argue that the UFO is coming to the rescue of the church. Wait that is also the plot twist of Encounter at Farpoint.So that‚Äôs who‚Äôs been doin it.You mean the shell being used as a lamp?  How is it setting fire to a church?  That‚Äôs missing paint not a laser.\s\sI think let me look again.\s\sEdit: YES! Missing paint.Awesome find I've seen so many UFOs in old paintings but never this one. It looks like the cover of a pulp novel.Although what looks like smoke and fire on there could also be blemishes?I know this is not the interpretation you're looking for but almost definitely the artist was depicting the interaction of the divine/the Holy Spirit with the world and not a ""UFO.""If the ‚Äúdivine‚Äù is a saucer shaped craft how is that distinguishable from ‚ÄúUFO‚Äù?you know art existed back then too right?Wait a moment there was a DOMINICAN Monastery in ROMANIA ?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I want to believe that these beings are visiting earth but come on!Couldn't it have been their depiction of Ezekiel's wheel?that looks painted on top of itThe script seems to say ""Israel hope for the Lord"". Not too sure about Israel but it would make sense if they meant people of israel as in god's chosen people.So what if the first translators translated wrong?? Then forever no one will know the truthEven if that were fire there is little that leads me to believe the UFO started it.\sShame about the title here.  But keep the cool ancient UFO art coming folks.The Ophanim were wheel-shaped angels that never slept and were sometimes said to guard the throne of God. It‚Äôs probably one of the Ophanim.or a UFO falling to the church?What was the Teutonic language?I'd love to see that painting restored. It's gorgeous.Clearly there‚Äôs a lot of problems going on hereEven the UFOs thought the churches sucked.Wild. I wonder if there‚Äôs more art like this out there.I'm pretty sure the Church is shooting the UFO down.Wow!

It depicts God coming down to earth.[deleted]Vikings be like ""they took our jobs!!""And because its a drawing we take it as real evidence?. Not convinced.Not a ufo and not fire. Nice try.Bro thats a mushroom capLooks like an upside-down mushroom to me which would make sense because it's a shroom cultThe 1977 Gallarta Spain OVNI case as it is known is really interesting.  The Spanish Air Force declassified 55 UFO sightings but only four ever received a full investigation ([list here](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=137829)).\s\sGallarta was one of them where a carpenter named Juan Sillero claimed a disc-shaped craft landed near his rural home five times one of which he went on board and spoke with the ""beings.""  Among the things he claims he observed:\s\s&#x200B;\s\s* the disc seemed to be collecting samples of the ground\s* onboard there was a circular console with a red sphere in the middle that ""lit up"" when Spanish Air Force jets approached\s* the beings communicated telepathically with him\s* the beings he observed that didn't communicate to him were grunting to each other and waving their arms exaggeratedly\s* they warned him Earth's axis was ""tilting too much"" something NASA has recently analyzed due to Greenland ice melt and mantle convection (though they aren't worried about it)\s\sIt's a wild story but the Air Force concluded he was a reliable witness and was consistent in his re-tellings.  They ultimately didn't conclude anything landed due to a lack of physical evidence.\s\sYears later an official from that Air Region told journalist JJ Benitez (who covered Juan's case) that there were anomalous radar returns those nights in 1977 and they did scramble jets twice to check it out.  Curiously any mention of radar returns is omitted from the Gallarta case file despite the Spanish military disclosing this information for other sightings.\s\sFull case file (in Spanish): [http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp\_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda\_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886)That time of 1967 to 1977 was the most active period for sightings and abductions in history.\s\sMany experiences like this one are not known by many in modern times but really happened.I mean of all the issues facing Earth today our axis tilting too much is not one of them.\s\sThat said weird pranks and lies from aliens are very common in contactee stories. A friend of mine who was a UFO investigator talked to two men who claimed that the following happened to them:  a flying saucer came down and a regular-looking man came out and asked ""What time is it?""  One of them said ""It's 2:30"" and the alien said ""You are lying. It's 4PM""  and then flew off.\s\s\sMy friend said it was a really stupid story and yet he was convinced these two guys believed that it had happened.  For one thing they were two good ol' boys and they were the laughing stock of the small town they were in.  They seemed desperately embarrassed and knew that it was a stupid story - one of them actually said ""I know this is a stupid story"" - and yet they continued to claim it had happened even though it was clearly working out badly for them.\s\s---\s\sI tend to believe Jacques Vall√©e who ended up believing that UFOs are not from another planet but some sort of local phenomenon connected to geomagnetism.  Note that this does _not_ eliminate the possibility of ""aliens"" - just not ""aliens"" from another world.\s\s""The call is coming from inside the house!""\s\sSee also this excellent book: http://www.tricksterbook.com/\s\s----\s\sThanks for an interesting article!The idea that aliens would want to fuck with us like we do each other is both hilarious and comforting for me.Interesting. Why would they allow him inside freely?

I order from a reputable site ordered twice now and shrooms are great. Comes from BC within 3-5 days.It‚Äôs crazy we have to ALLOW the government to allow us to do what we want with our own life.

They get a kick back while I‚Äôm Dui Inf in the hospital. Win win.So I have to literally be on my death bed for the government to allow me to put what I want in my body?

LOLKeeping drugs illegal keeps a division within society especially when users have to live in fear constantly....any day becoming a life altering series of consequences which killers don't often faceAnd this is how Canada became the place of Psychedelic rocklol if i wanna do shrooms if im dying just go ahead and try to stop me.i did both acid and shrooms and could say the destination is the same on both but acid is the easier trip to take to get there than shrooms. shrooms are way more intense but the after effects are the same on either shrooms or acidCouldn‚Äôt it just be possible you took a higher dose of shrooms than the dose you took for acid?Allowing. Joke. Bad one.I don't know....seems like a waste to me....I think there's a much better demographic.That s cruel cause it only takes one simple thought to make you have a bad trip remember the mind is racing his own race during that timeI don't think that's exactly how it works. Plus I think anyone willing to do psychedelics on their death bed will be pretty well supervised and/or know what they're doingThere's therapy and guidance before during and after the trip to mitigate the possibility of a traumatic experience.There are no bad trips just bad thoughts or memories we dont want to face or deal with.**Strangers**: Read the rules and understand the sub topics listed in the sidebar closely before posting or commenting.

Probably similar to what most people experience in a toxic relationship.I came across this list soon after leaving my ex husband- and I was FLOORED. He did this to me systematically for 15 years. It was wild and I am amazed I was able to break away as easily as I did.\s\sThe thing is I don't believe that he was consciously doing these things- it was like he was born knowing how to manipulate. (Which isn't true because I know he was keen on reading self help and things like ""how to make friends and influence people""- which when used by an apt narcissitic person with a natural skill for reading people is gold for his motives).That‚Äôs how I often describe the relationship between the government & the people. (The govt obviously being the abuser). Many people in the US mimic symptoms of Stockholm syndrome. (Ex: those who are pro-govt pro-police pro-capitalism etc.) They literally end up fighting against their own justice & rights which seems wild but then I remember the brainwashing/abusive dynamic here‚Ä¶This is a short list compared to the long list of tactics they have in place to ensure constant brainwashing/programming.It‚Äôs exactly the same! (Been there done that trying to get out.)Or following certain ""news"" outlets.\s\s(never in my wildest imaginings did I think people would turn to Facebook as a trusted news source. did not have that on my Nostradamus bingo card)I was about to say....Lord you‚Äôre right.Very similar to what‚Äôs going on during the pandemic.That‚Äôs what I was going to say. I feel like I went through these with my ex.Sounds like what children of narcissistic parents experience.Also what people experience when being held after an arrest.I was just about to say...the first thing that comes to my mind is false confessions and how the public can't understand why anyone would confess to something they didn't do and how the confessions trump any other evidence when it comes to trials and stuff. It's just awful.Sounds like the entire restaurant industry.Waiting tables is one of the most fucked up environments I‚Äôve ever worked in.

I know my mother believes it's all some sort of ""mass control."" But I have to ask truly in the spirit of better understanding: to what end? Why would ""the media"" or ""the government"" want to have people wear masks and get vaccinations *aside* from literally just trying to stop the spread of a disease that has already killed millions in just under 2 years? Like what nefarious benefit would someone get by having people wear cough masks?\s\sFor extra bonus points can anyone explain what they believe the claimed ""microchips"" would actually accomplish inside the body? I know the smallest current rfid chip is .125 x .245mm and the largest needle used in COVID vaccine shots has an inner diameter of .337 so you could potentially jam some RFID tags into your arm muscle through the shot... But then what? Rfid tags are inert they bounce back a signal in response to their tiny antennae receiving a radio signal. But they don't do anything by themselves. So you need them to be attached to other chips which are going to increase the size. But then even if you could shrink a chip down small enough to communicate with the outside world and then do something in response to that communication... What could you make it do? It doesn't make sense as a tracking mechanism because just about everyone already has a much more functional and nefarious tracking device in their pocket at nearly all times.\s\sI don't know what I'm missing here in terms of motivations or intended results.I've thought the same thing.  Especially the part about how 6 feet of social distancing is somehow being used as a control.   A coworker went off about it last year claiming it was so ""THEY could track us better through our cell phones because it was harder to count them in crowds"".  Even if that was true to what end?  What's the point?\s\sA lot of nuts have plenty of reasons they think masks are a conspiracy too. Some BS about covering faces is against their religion (death cult/magaconservative Christianity) ""covering up God's image"" or some kind of Sharia law thing.  Another is that it somehow is being used to damage children's psyches or it's a test run for another version of psychological warfare.\s\sOne of my wife's coworkers is convinced the vaccine is some sort of population control by sterilization.  She still got at least one shot since a planned trip required her to get vaccinated in order to go anywhere in NYC.I was thinking more with the whole racism in America thing. Yeah it exists here like anywhere. Is it as bad as people say? Probably not. But it is highlighted in media to be a huge problem. I can think of a video about ‚Äúracism in America‚Äù for almost every one of those numbers. This isn‚Äôt to say that historically racism has led to the system we have today. But does the average person hate someone because their not the same color? No. They‚Äôre probably more likely to hate someone for being a ‚Äúleftist‚Äù or ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù.The mask and covid restrictions are supposed to be a way of conditioning people so in the future they will comply with whatever the plan is.   The chip thing is about tracking you and implementing a digital currency. 5g conspiracies claim the chip will allow the government to be able to control your mind or even kill you if you have a chip.   All of it sounds crazy but a lot of things have sounded crazy before it was realityReminds me of how the media wants us to feel because of this new diseaseHm. Covid maybe?How so?Like people who where 3+ masks whilst they drive aloneOr people who invent stories about fictional people to make themselves feel better about themselves.No one does this. Maybe like 1 in 100000 or less.

This is in large part because the ownership class works very hard day and night to make manipulation via torture and abuse seem like regular day-to-day practice. \s\sI'm sorry you had to endure that and I'm glad you got out.Mental illness absolutely can be induced by one person onto another.

Gaslighting goal post moving emotional blackmail  physical violence as punishment  isolation  and even torture at times.  Dont ever feel bad or stupid bc they pick you for a reason.  They try to steal our authenticity and goodness bc they are empty inside and need us to sustain themselves. That's why they keep coming back. We are like drugs to them. Think of them like emotional vampires. It's great you got out and didn't waste a lot of time. You will heal and be better off for it.

Especially if you were a Marine.‚ÄúWhite Fragility‚Äù ringin a really strong bell hereI‚Äôll bet this list of emotional states is applied unironically to groups of people who disagree with insane conspiracies. Qanon has been accusing ‚Äúnormies‚Äù of being in a brainwashed cultic state for a couple years now.\s\sThe list tracks pretty well with what we know about brainwashing propaganda gaslight and manipulation. We see Item 9 play out quite a lot in social media these days in that radicalized dummies seem to always exhibit a persecution complex.In a way we're all being brain washed. But it's called conditioning. We're being conditioned to accept ever more indecent absurd and just wrong behaviour and attitudes. We are being divided and isolated. We're encouraged to be narcissistic sadistic & medicated.\sThe fact that the ""intelligence"" community are manipulating on a mass scale is not surprising.\sWhat's surprising is how so few of us realise this and even fewer are afraid to look above the parapet and ask why the status quo is so.\sI'm off to put my tin foil hat back on and hide from the MIB whilst I pop Xanax like tic tac and pray for Osiris/Siva to come back and save us.you're not wrongThis sounds like how social media works...*bingo*This is exactly the kind of thing that took place when the US school system took a hard turn to authoritarianism in the early 1990s.  Zero tolerance and demoralization narratives instilled dependence on authority and ideological indoctrination.  This is why so many later millennials and early Z's are completely lacking in self discipline critical thinking and everything else that makes one a competent human being.This started in the 80's with the Reagan era ""Just say no"" indoctrination. Schools in the 70's would have ""sit-ins"" by the students to get more freedoms and Rec Centers put in place for kids to belong to. Drugs were discussed in a civilized manner with kids and real counseling was available. Then the ""Drugs are bad m'kay?"" started and corporate rule was put into place because parents couldn't parent anymore.Gen Xer checking in...\s\sThis whole demonization of Millennials is reminiscent of how ‚Äúthey‚Äù treated Gen X.  I guess all generations get the treatment but the fact is that these groups have grown up in a society that is crumbling before their eyes yet they are held to some standard of performance that just isn‚Äôt widely available to them.  They‚Äôre just fine considering what they contend with economically culturally and politically.  Their generation has mostly lived during a time of war as military members have endured more combat than most WWII veterans and have been subject to more propaganda and psyops than any pre 9/11 generation.  They don‚Äôt lack self discipline critical thinking or anything else than makes one a competent human being.  That‚Äôs a lazy argument.I was born in 1982 but never felt a part of my generation  and was told since early childhood I'm an ""old soul"". Now fast forward to today I dont have anything in common with my generation.  I feel like they speak a different language and honestly they disturb me. In general  they cannot think for themselves at all and social acceptance is everything.  They are mostly unsuccessful and miserable too. That's just my opinion from people I know around my age. Its very strange.CIA created the term ""brainwashing"" in order to discredit captured agents.If you want to create a Unibomber this is how you do it.Me: *checks on mood* nope still don't give a fuck what popular opinion is. Still all good herePopular opinion? I feel like you‚Äôve seriously misunderstood the concept here.\s\sBrainwashing has nothing to do with popular opinion. I don‚Äôt think Charles Manson‚Äôs or Jim Jones‚Äô opinions were mainstream or popular but they successfully brainwashed people. \s\sIt‚Äôs actually concerning that you immediately thought ‚Äúpopular opinion‚Äù and implied that since your opinions are less mainstream that you couldn‚Äôt have possibly been brainwashed ever and are somehow immune. \s\sThat‚Äôs scary. What made you say this? Can you explain your logic behind this conclusion?That's actually a very popular opinion you have there. Maybe that's when they got you!Why do i feel like this was what i experienced during this pandemic living with anti capitalists and atheist?Join us comrade[removed][removed]Good social credit botEven if this sub is a right wing echo chamber like 90% of reddit is a left wing one. Upvotes are useless if you are over the age of 16 and care so much about them you've got big problems in your life lol.Source?Cia.goveither page is getting he reddit hug of death or......wont even finish loadingWhile in the context of brainwashing this seems bad doesn‚Äôt this just describe the process of getting over trauma? When taking out step 4 it really just seems like something a person goes through when learning something that staggers their perspective reality. Or am I missing something? Genuinely curious.This is a great podcast about the entire situation. \s\s[https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/440-brainwashed](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/440-brainwashed)\s\sThe guilty parties have never been brought to justice.Source?Sounds like the covidiotsQanon checklistGood to know.\s\s""Oh my you startled me!

This is something worth remembering.\s\sThis part of the documents talks about the different emotional states created during the brainwashing process. It looks like it depends on cracking the person and then taking advantage of the trauma in order to create a new sense of ""belonging"" or identity...So how small cults work? They break a person down and build them up to be someone else. And before you know it you have a dozen people working themselves to death on your commune in Canada while you cut their fingers and toes off for fun. And they stick around like that for a decade.*googles MK ULTRA*\s\sJesus fuck.Is the whole document available to the public? If so I‚Äôd love to know where you found it!Ahhhhhhhh very cunty of themWhat document is this from?Can you link to the document itself? Would really appreciate it.Sounds like army basic trainingIt is. Some have said the army is a cult.Thats the point and also why so many vets can't reintegrate back into society (aside from the PTSD many have which complicates things).I'm fully convinced that social medias are undertaking actions to influence the opinion of the society at large induce certain emotional states and more. Some among these feature almost text-book examples of brainwashing techniques similar to the ones in OP as performed by ""fellow users"".\s\sThat's why it's vital to never stay in one place for too long never go to deep never to bind with local society too much. ;)Reddit is a prime example of effective brainwashing.Actually binding yourself to your localized communities is the antidote. Mass media including social media is the poison of spectacle.\s\sMass media will be the only society you can relate to if you're always running from your local communities.100% of the media is propagandaThe news networks are even worse. They should be called anti-social media.FB admitted manipulating streams to affect moodI do wonder what they were thinking of when they wrote ""Initial feeling of surprise"" like dude you just gave him enough LSD to kill a walrus what did you think would happenMaybe the researchers would go in an do a little magic trick.Now this is the r/HighStrangeness shit I love. I don't think anybody could actually know the full extent to which the CIA influences seemingly mundane aspects of our lives. But I *really* don't think anybody could say that they don't manipulate our lives atleast somehow.I‚Äôve been seeing post about someone having asthma problems because the amount of cremations in California I see these kind of post every day that just screams propaganda. Kind of like how you‚Äôve been seeing so many post celebrating people turning in their family to the FBI""There are 4 lights.""This reminds me of my past relationship which I have been free from for years. Isn't being single great?My tired ass thought this was an r/antiwork meme.üíÄ2 + 2 = 5.I will never forgive the American Psychological Association for condoning the psychologists that participated in torture research.\s\sOh and *fuck* those psychologists particularly.\s\sSource: am psychologistAnd water boarding.Are these the files of the black vault?Anyone have the link to this doc?Someone shared their podcast discussing this a few months back.

I think that the powers that be understands how mental illness such as Disassociative Identity Disorder works much more than they let on because they want to use it against us or their ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. I feel like the value system of treat yourself and others how you wish to be treated is pretty foolproof though as long as you keep it simpleSounds kind of like a certain global FUD campaign we've been living under for a year or so.Here here !\sGood find \sExactly what‚Äôs happeningAn interesting similarity with how Barry Long describes the ""thinker""'s reaction to not thinking in the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrxRgpsrpGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrxRgpsrpGg)Sauce?[removed]Your account must be a minimum of 2 weeks old to post comments or posts.\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

That‚Äôs it. It actually kind of disturbed me while I was watching it. It‚Äôs not like this was the first time I thought of this but they put some crazy shit in these supposed ‚Äúkids‚Äù shows that is revealing and also scary how this plays right into brainwashingOperation MockingbirdSo y'all just link to the CIA website around here? Cool and totally normal.Funny it‚Äôs also the same emotional states caused by being a member of society in America.\s\sOmg wait are we all...?This is so creepy. Many of the various social and political movements that have sprung up in the past few decades rely on these emotional states. It's always existed in societies although I'm convinced it's become exponentially worse recently. They maintain tight control over nearly organization and movement.\s\sI'm certain that the federal government is running all kinds of psy-ops on the general populace. They're using these techniques to divide and conquer the public in order to maintain control. They've infiltrated all levels of entertainment and media. Marketing is essentially based on manipulating people's brains to invoke control. It's borderline witchcraft.\s\sIt's shocking to me to see how many people are okay with submitting control to these fucks. They want to control every aspect of our lives. They want us to become walking talking puppets of the DNC and the GOP whichever flavor of authoritarianism that people find palpable. The government is not the friend of the American people.You nailed itDo you really think they did all this research that we now know about and aren't using it? Even if not the government corporations hire former intelligence officers and weasel out their secrets to make us buy more shit we don't need.Yeah I was gonna say-pretty much described my life.Welcome to the education system.Mass brainwashing has been fine tuned for a very long time yet there are people out there that think it isn't real or a conspiracy theory...it's sad as they too are brainwashed to some degree without even knowing it.Facebook has become a very effective tool for this. Or social media in general.I was just thinking about this yesterday. The MKULTRA experiments may have ended (just one example I‚Äôm sure) but only after an enormous amount of knowledge and data had been collected. There is a ton of applicable knowledge on changing people‚Äôs minds. \s\sIt‚Äôs like a ‚Äúmoving from trials to production‚Äù phase.Just because we're aware of it doesn't mean we're completely immune either.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/03/montreal-brainwashing-allan-memorial-institute](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/03/montreal-brainwashing-allan-memorial-institute)   \s[https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/m\_episodes/2017-2018/brainwashed-the-secret-cia-experiments-in-canada](https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/m_episodes/2017-2018/brainwashed-the-secret-cia-experiments-in-canada)\s\s[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-government-gag-order-mk-ultra-1.4448933](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-government-gag-order-mk-ultra-1.4448933)\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThe pM of canada himself put a gag order on the casehave you ever heard the conspiracy theories of someone that is really deep in the brainwashing?  one of which i heard the other day ""there's a theory that aliens haven't made direct contact because their societies keep crumbling like rome did"" i was like....\shold up... a whole bunch of alien contact was just declassified and this is your theory?  lmaoReminds me of schoolOr some religious cult or trying to leave itYepBingo!My USMC boot camp experience all wrapped up.Correct break you down and build you back up.This is my rifle this is my gun!Makes you wonder if they perfected it by now. They probably did and many people in high positions are actually brainwashed and controlled to spread certain messages and so on. How long until we live in a world similar to 1984 :)... depressing..You're already in it man. Almost everything is nonsensicalIt‚Äôs here.So that‚Äôs why drill Sargents are the way they are.Think I'm being brainwashed then that's me.1984Would the impersonal machinery of control be equivalent to the interrogator‚Äôs authority?This is literally what Ego-Death is.I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like a trip where you almost have an ego death. A true ego death makes you forget that you (your physical form) even exist(s). There‚Äôs no You to defend.Now ask yourself just how many political ideological groups rely on exactly these steps. \s\s1. ""You have no power as an individual."" \s2. ""Just look what horrible things have been going on that you weren't even aware were bad."" \s3.

Except (4) since there needs to be an interrogator these feelings are kind of similar to when you face your ego. Being uncertain feeling guilt doubting yourself and wanting to find an easy way out. Then you look inward and develop your own value system.Well if we‚Äôre considering that this method (in its presumably simplest form) can be/is being used on a mass scale then each idea listed evolves to fit that scale. Also considering they would most likely use clusters of demographics to achieve this the idea of an ‚Äúinterrogator‚Äù could look like anything from the President of the United States to Tony the Tiger.The Numbers Mason....Ya'll need to listen to Poisoner in Chief about the beginning of CIA focusing on Sidney Gottlieb and his crazy obsession with mind control. It's so much more spectacular and disturbing than I imagined!Operation Mockingbird has achieved a loss of objectivity in almost everyone.I blame that on social media and the human condition of people needing continuous affirmation and praise.This fits the covid fear mongering and subsequent population control perfectlywhere is 1.?This is happening to all of us through social media and the general media. Some people are more susceptible but no one is immune. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of tv shows have been pushing similar themes and it feels like entertainment has become a propaganda machine. How much attention you receive on these platforms is controlled by algorithms designed by people who at best want to make money and at worse have shady tides to Russia and the US government. I think Russia and the US government have been conducting social engineering war fare through the American public I think this is why everyone has been losing their minds and becoming increasingly radicalized in the US. If you start to stray from whatever they want you to think all it takes is a pop socket account comment a targeted ad recommending you a video or post to help put you where they want you to be. When George Floyd died I found it strange that the news kept playing videos of him getting choked to death on a loop for instance. This was odd to me because the news has a tendency to censor disturbing content as well as at least giving a disclaimer that the content may be disturbing to some viewers but they just straight up played video of a man getting choked to death over and over and over again with little to no warning. I think they were trying to rile people up who knows to what end exactly but something is very wrong with the American media right now and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly blatant.What themes have you noticed entertainment pushing?Is this like GaslightingWhat part of the document is it from? It‚Äôs 92 pages longThis explains antifaSounds like Landmark Forum.Sounds like high schoolLmaoWilliam Blum writes extensively about CIA mental manipulation/torture in ‚ÄúKilling Hope‚Äù.

It has significantly strengthened who I am within and helped me over come my many self-doubts depression and feeling lost in life and in spirit. Though much of that can be attributed to being surrounded with the right influences of consciously positive uplifting constructive energies.[deleted]Sounds like my workplace..Came here to say this.I must be getting brainwashedLmao. The government brainwashes people all the time. Just look at mainstream society. It's all the governments work in the end and then the people brainwash each other and keep them trapped in a loop extremely difficult to escape as BS materialist thoughts have been ingrained in them deeply from the womb. Any alternative ideas are only discussed in niche places such as this otherwise paid workers and brainwashed people alike will call us crazy. And even then some get through. The war on consciousness has gone on for far too long and needs to end ASAP. We all need to wake up before it's too late.Yuuuup. I have a group of friends (more like acquaintances) who all work in sales and are extremely materialistic. Everything is about who is leasing the hottest car who has the most designer clothes and jewelry who's sleeping with the hottest girl. Meanwhile these are MEN in their mid to late 30's with families. With wives and little children. Some of them bring their young kids around dangerous places and just let them roam while they drink and party. Yet bring up any of this to them and you're the crazy one.I like the way you think. I slave away in an office to make a rich man richer for pennies on the dollar as my salary. Then I buy shit to fill an emotional void that was created by the soul sucking job in the first place.Might I introduce you to a fine ideology that fits your worldview... comrade?

Someone remembers a large owl then after regression therapy the layer of false memory is stripped away revealing something different. False memory is a form of mind control.

It‚Äôs a seven-pointed lattice one moment and a ten-pointed lattice the next or whatever.\s\s>What‚Äôs amazing about time crystals is that when they cycle back and forth between two different configurations they don‚Äôt lose or use any energy.\s\s>Time crystals can survive energy processes without falling victim to entropy. The reason they‚Äôre called time crystals is because they can have their cake and eat it too.\s\s>They can be in a state of having eaten the whole cake and then cycle right back to a state of still having the cake ‚Äì and they can theoretically do this forever and ever.\s\s>Most importantly they can do this inside of an isolated system. That means they can consume the cake and then magically make it reappear over and over again forever without using any fuel or energy.Ok cool but where did they come from? Did google create them? Did someone just find them somewhere?What I'm getting from this is we are 1 quadrillionth of a percent closer to answering The Last Question...\s\s ""How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be\smassively decreased?""Google can barely make their ad-serving work.

General Relativity in particular uses a 4-dimensional spacetime (3 spacial dimensions one temporal dimension) manifold to describe interactions pertaining to gravity energy and light in particular.If my understanding is correct the 4th dimension looks like thought dreams or simply imagination. While Humans are not the best at occupying this dimension we haven't skipped it. There are ppl that can astral project/ lucid dream some drugs can take you there for what feels like forever.4th dimension is time num-nutsI heard Jeffery Epstein talk about something like this years ago.

Billions and billions on labs and funds and dark matter was never found and probably never will be. Electricity is the key plasma and dust are holding it together not some invisible non-interacting particle> Billions and billions on labs and funds and dark matter was never found and probably never will be\s\sMaybe it's something that can't be found in the way we're looking for it. Like imagine climbing every tree in search of oysters and pearls and then concluding when your search inevitably ends up fruitless that oysters and pearls simply cannot be real because you've checked every tree.Dark Matter does exist we know that. We have had [direct proof](https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06297_CHANDRA_Dark_Matter.html) of it for over a decade it's all around us and the universe has plenty of it.\s\sWe just don't know why it's there or what it does. It has an effect on gravity giving us something called ""gravitational lensing"". We also see strange effects in rotating galaxies galaxies that combine and hot gas.\s\sIt's probably one of the strangest things about the universe that we can actually prove exists.If the math checks out its far more possible than ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù. Sounds like a pessimistic view.Sounds like you should need to be writing a paperPretty much.\s\sJust the name dark matter shows the current problem in thinking.\s\sTo start with it should probably be more accurately called dark ""mass"" but our physics has no distinction between matter and mass.I volunteer as tributeMore scientists sitting in rooms reading too much sci fi too high on their own farts just making crap up to explain the holes in their current theories.The age of aquariussssss ‚ôí üíìAaaaaaaQuariusssssss...ExcusemesaywhatCome to me my childrenwho said thatFeed us from your hefty breastiesMaybe we should master this one....\s before we start fkn up another.More math bullshit mathematical dimensions arnt the same thing as say living in the 3rd spacial dimension. They are purely mathematical gymnastics. They have no proof any of it exists yet they act as if its not all theoretical.How on earth can you say 'more math bullshit' when it has been proven again and again to be the best tool we have to describe the world and universe around us.Math = EverythingWhy downvote he‚Äôs rightI thought String theory proposed multiple universes already and I at least thought that this meant that these subatomic particles exist in other reality as well and we are witnessing their observation and by that their existence. Not too out there to say that Dark Matter exist in another dimension that interact with our own in a way that we can detect it but we can‚Äôt mess with it.There is that saying of ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt explain it simply you don‚Äôt understand it‚Äù and I think of that every time I see what is happening in theoretical physics. The great draw of Einstein and the quantum theorists is they were able to explain the ideas in simple widely applicable ideasThere's a whole bunch of things we can't explain. I have an idea let's create a new particle that lets us warp into this imagination land that explains everything we can't already explain.DON'T LET THEM IN !!!Ah yes the warp. Of course!Where do I sign up? This dimension and a great deal of the people in it are trash.To get there mentally requires a perspective change. Are some people trash or did they experience a lot of pain in their life that they need help digging out of?Event Horizon noooope!Don‚Äôt!!! Or we end up like Event Horizon or Warhammer 40k for that matter ...Or the mistand OMG this is all based on....wait for it....absolutely nothing but speculation.TLDR at bottom. \s\s\sHere‚Äôs a little philosophy of science for those that are downvoting everyone for being skeptical about this. \s\s\sThe downfall for mathematical models is quite ironic- that they are so capable of describing just about any interaction and behavior that there are infinite ways of describing the same function. \s\s\sThink of a entering a function for some shape on a calculator. Well it turns out there is an infinite number of different functions that would graph the same shape. In physics terminology - there are an infinite number of mathematical models with equal descriptive and predictive power with respect to the actual universe. \s\s\sSecondly is the problems pointed out in the Duhem-Quine thesis which states that for any system S any hypothesis H can be maintained if modifications are made to background assumptions of system S. \s\s\sIn physics terms: in the system of fundamental physics the core hypothesis of dark matter can be maintained regardless of any opposing evidence by modifying auxiliary hypothesis (in this case modifying some aspect of physical dimensions). You can do this forever without coming closer to truth \s\s\s\sLastly add to this Kuhn‚Äôs observation that science tends to advance not linearly but in intervals of stagnation where people refuse to alter their core hypothesis and periods of scientific revolution where the core paradigms are altogether shattered and replaced. This tells us we should expect a sort of scientific closed mindedness and these mathematical models are very much an invention to try to protect their core paradigm (using Duhem-Quine)- like Copernicus introducing epicycles to correct deviations between observed and predicted orbits. \s\s\sTLDR; These models are just conjecture perhaps even a form of scientific close mindedness. However the conjecture and generation of hypothesis is how science advances. So it is ‚Äújust some math bullshit‚Äù but bullshit is also how just about every discovery begins.Well it's a Vice article after all.Mmm actually it‚Äôs based on [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-08851-0).\s\sI may not be able to understand it but then again I‚Äôm not a theoretical physicist.And so was the Higgs boson particle until they discovered it. That‚Äôs how science worksso did you read the scientific research paper attached...or ?? i‚Äôm guessing you didn‚ÄôtYou didn‚Äôt read or understand shit lol....you do understand that science isn‚Äôt ever fact right.. that‚Äôs why they are theories..I‚Äôve seen event horizon.So many interesting theories. Yet they mean absolutely nothing for everyday life. I wish scientists would actually discover something groundbreaking & awesome.Wild . But they cant figure out where coronavirus came from .Nah... they know where it came from... they just don't want to admit it because they wouldn't get any future funding for viral research and gain of function experiments would be banned.

You can't prove anything.\s\sBut lets just say after all I've heard and experienced myself it wouldn't surprise me. At all. I don't expect it but I wouldn't question it.I find it really interesting that in one of the books by Jane Roberts her friend Sue Watkins had a telepathic dream where she communicated with a different dominant species of high intelligence that appeared to be cat looking people that iirc were from a different probability. They shared some level of information with her that drifted from her conscious mind as she woke up. This happened back in the 70's.\-\_- so late Egypt people know it a long time ago that's why they worship cat.

The only time in my life I had lucid dreams was when I took Chantax the anti smoking drug. In one dream I was exploring a shipwreck and I kept finding a bunch of gold coins.

LolAnd then they are gonna have ads no thank you I rather lucid dreaming no machines needed we already can do so powerade by our own brains.Ive been wondering my whole life if the day would ever arrive where a drug or tool would exist that allows us to control/manipulate or explore our dreams in a conscious or lucid state on command.  \sMaybe the day is near :)Sounds like they‚Äôre building an external manual control to let you become lucid while in a dreamWhether the information was bollocks or not isnt my point here but doesn't the CIA declassified info on astral projection state they found a way to project near instantly? Maybe this is similar technology.Isn‚Äôt that just lucid dreaming?Really?You don't need a machine to do this you can just train/teach yourself to lucid dream and/or astral project.

I've been fascinated with the idea for years and have honestly just come to my own conclusion that it's true.\s\sI'm gonna stay away from the comments there though.\s\s>This mudflood type theory only puts our current civilization at about 250 to 300 years old I think. To clarify some of these theories state we had a cataclysm (I think approx 10000 years ago or maybe earlier) that almost wiped us all out but some survived underground etc. Those who survived didn't fully resurface and start to fully repopulate parts of earth until 1750.\s\sWe're only 300 years old? Like what?Mudflood is the deep strangeness. Jesuit/Catholic rewriting of history the annihilation of the ""Tartarian"" empire and its legacy. Greco-roman/colonial architecture all being in situ around the world and then re-inhabited by the conquerors. The US civil war being a mask for the final stand of the Tartarians...It's heady stuff and way way out there.\s\sI've put my head in the overall theory before and can't buy it (obviously) but it is a fascinating rabbit hole. You can check out r/culturallayer r/tartaria r/mudflood and especially stolenhistory.org if you want to go there.\s\sThere's definitely something odd about old buildings being built with windows and a door on the basement level (underground) and it's basically impossible for a building in a city/town with regular foot traffic and occupation to somehow accumulate enough ""cultural layer"" (this being dirt/trash that accretes over decades and centuries) that they suddenly have to build a new entrance on the 2nd floor...No one swept the porch for 100 years so then they had to built a new door 1 level up? Can't get my head around that.A very very interesting read.Earth Starts with Sumerians and beyond that is all high strangeness.High Strangeness is reality.#OOPARTSI‚Äôm sorry but as a conspiracy theorist if there was a more advanced civilization we would find traces in currency. I need to see currency that‚Äôs been produced to modern standards before I believe there was one that was more advanced that our own. Imperfect circle coins vs what an American quarter would a great start.While I'm not saying I believe in something like an ancient advanced civilisation I think that it would be very possible for a civilisation to develop without currency no? It's not like money is an universal concept.What if they didn't value currency like we do? It can be a means to purchase and trade and not be idolized the way our current society does. If that were the case why would they care to make extravagant coins that were perfectly uniform? Make sure it's the right weight slap it with a stamp and it's ready for use. \s\sWe can't instill our culture on the past when trying to think of how or why things happened.The very first case is of a copper quasi coin being found which was estimated to be at least 200k years old. \s\sAm I missing something?What if they had digital currency like we have? They could‚Äôve advanced past our idea of credit cards and used something non-physicalThe earliest known currency was cowrie shells. Other civilisations used a system of ropes with elaborate knottings to track family ledgers / debts within their community. How do you know you would recognise this ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô for what it is? Also hunter gatherers survived for thousands of years with no currency trading objects or skills with other bands of travellers.currency? i wouldn't consider a civilization even close to being advanced if they still rely on physical currency they have to carry around on their persons.  I think currency would be one of the last things we find. \s\sRegardless the evidence is undoubtedly down there. its just too deep under dirt too see itThere‚Äôs an incredible amount of evidence of ancient advanced civilizations the megalithic structures are there for you to learn about.Very interesting list thanks for the link! There were many I hadn't heard of yet here.\s\sI'm glad it didn't include the London Hammer which is always brought up as *the* OOPART. But it's clear that it's modern even before you start to look at the object itself. Just looking at the creationist museum it's in and how they make grand claims and publish ""facts"" about the alloy and the rock it was found in yet not a single place they show you who made the analysis or even when it was made. It's just speculation on their part.What a fantastic read from r/conspiracy. Wonder how many posts like this get buried under all the politics over there.There‚Äôs another conspiracy sub that deletes all political conspiracies/or political talk.There are still gems scattered throughout the feed for people who search by new.Its kinda like a dumpster fire  but if  that dumpster was outside of a voting booth and said trash were absentee ballotsGod I miss when there were actual conspiracies there and not just people ranting about Bill Gates and 5G towers.

And i came too and hes standing there ready to dial 911. I didnt know what happened i thought i just fell asleep because i was yawning.

Go get some fresh air"" so i went to open the outside door. Then i blacked out. Came too laying on the door frame half in half out  bro was losing it again it was freaking me out. I got up saw headlights thought they were the pizza dudes. I asked him where the money was for pizza. But he didnt order pizza he couldnt stop laughing while ordering lol. And after i came to and was settled into the couch i just felt like we were the only people and there was nothing outside the door like. Blackness. Was kinda nightmarish.\s\s\sThen i after a few years i took it with my wife. And was a really great experience. I was really hesitant to do it after that though. But when i did. It was great i got experience the non stop laughing. We were watching miss peregrines home for peculiar children. What made us laugh was i was paying for the pizza and apparently the pizza dude was peaking at my wife through the slit between door and the frame by the hinges. Was making her laugh. I seen him like crane his neck to the left a bit. Was hilarious. \s\sSorry for the long ass story but thought id share my first bad experience then giving it a second try.My trip on mushrooms resulted in a seizure. it was a small one and I never did anything about it but I think back to that day and wonder what caused it. I‚Äôm not going to try again to find out though lol.Did you try using it again after this experience?Always have a sitter for all those wonderingA good point. I should note I am not advocating nor advising anyone use Psilocybin by posting this research. My intent is to raise awareness to the potentially profound benefits of this substance for those in need and one of the more recently discovered mechanisms by which it tends to exert its potential benefits. I wouldn't expect most people to drop everything (pun intended) and seek this substance after reading this article nor that they would have the ability or access to do so. To me it's more of an interesting anecdote to add to the now voluminous amount of research illustrating the potential and often likely benefits this substance can provide some people. Of course as with anything of this nature your results will likely vary and of course will not be for everyone perhaps even most people. And if you do decide to take that step ensure you do so cautiously legally in a safe environment and starting with a lower dosage to gauge your reaction and to avoid doing so entirely if you suffer from any medical or mental condition that may make you more prone to experience any adverse reaction.hiw many tumes do i have to read this exact post with this exact headline and exact link. we know. we get it. mushrooms are good.I'm sorry to hear you've been apparently inundated with this story. Had I known it was this ubiquitous I probably wouldn't have posted it. Honestly I rarely browse r/all much at this point opting instead to focus on the communities I moderate and contribute to foremost as well as a handful of others of particular interest. I'll keep your feedback in mind and check other subreddits covering similar subjects for similar stories more frequently moving forward.Source paper:\s\s[A single psilocybin dose is associated with long-term increased mindfulness preceded by a proportional change in neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X20300602?via%3Dihub)\s\sAbstract:\s\s> A single dose of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist psilocybin can have long-lasting beneficial effects on mood personality and potentially on mindfulness but underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we for the first time conduct a study that assesses psilocybin effects on cerebral 5-HT2AR binding with [11C]Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and on personality and mindfulness. Ten healthy and psychedelic-na√Øve volunteers underwent PET neuroimaging of 5-HT2AR at baseline (BL) and one week (1W) after a single oral dose of psilocybin (0.2‚Äì0.3 mg/kg). Personality (NEO PI-R) and mindfulness (MAAS) questionnaires were completed at BL and at three-months follow-up (3M). Paired t-tests revealed statistically significant increases in personality Openness (puncorrected = 0.04 mean change [95%CI]: 4.2[0.4;‚àû]) which was hypothesized a priori to increase and mindfulness (pFWER = 0.02 mean change [95%CI]: 0.5 [0.2;0.7]). Although 5-HT2AR binding at 1W versus BL was similar across individuals (puncorrected = 0.8 mean change [95%CI]: 0.007 [‚àí0.04;0.06]) a post hoc linear regression analysis showed that change in mindfulness and 5-HT2AR correlated negatively (Œ≤ [95%CI] = ‚àí5.0 [‚àí9.0; ‚àí0.9] pFWER= 0.046). In conclusion we confirm that psilocybin intake is associated with long-term increases in Openness and ‚Äì as a novel finding ‚Äì mindfulness which may be a key element of psilocybin therapy. Cerebral 5-HT2AR binding did not change across individuals but the negative association between changes in 5-HT2AR binding and mindfulness suggests that individual change in 5-HT2AR levels after psilocybin is variable and represents a potential mechanism influencing long-term effects of psilocybin on mindfulness.I'll put this as a reply to OP. Here is a link to the full study https://docdro.id/NDZWi0q I'm not sure how long it will be available.  \s\sTwo things to note this is not yet peer reviewed and the study only had 10 subjects. Could be interesting though.Can confirm.  Went to the 12 dimensions met with 15 ft praying mantis who are the guardians.  And it got rid of my depression. *THUMBS UP*.  Seriously though use with caution.  Set and setting are very important.  Look into terrance mckenna alan watts.\s\s*edit for my A.D.D. mispellingInteresting you would word them ""preying"" and not the correct ""praying"" mantis. Be careful.In this day an age people aren‚Äôt guided correctly in their trips. They can reach that stage of mindfulness but many freak out. It turns into a ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù and they end up blocking the whole experience from their minds in a PTSD kind of way.wtf is mindfulnessmind¬∑ful¬∑ness\s\s1. The quality or state of being conscious or aware of something.\s\s2. A mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings thoughts and bodily sensations used as a therapeutic technique.As I said prior it's an established form of meditation that originated in Eastern region that is now used by Western medicine to treat anxiety and depression among other disorders and in some schools to notably increase student performance and concentration. The fact that psilocybin has been found to increase one's ability to perform this task by default without prior instruction through neurological changes to the brain may also contribute at least in part to its now extensively researched therapeutic effects.\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindfulnessSo where can I get some?All I know is that pre-mushroom Tools Lateralus was ho hum post mushroom fucking fantastic.I love you stranger.  Spiral out keep goingLiterally went on a 30 minute Tool binge before I remembered what I was doing in the first place thank you üñ§As with any psychedelic having a ""guide"" is very important to the individual on the ""trip"". Not only can a guide talk you thru tough/scary situations that may arise but also ensure the safety and well-being of that person while on their ""trip"". Not everyone is wired to handle such psychedelics and it is crucial that the patient undergo a thorough mental and physical evaluation prior to micro/dosing. The breakthroughs with psylicibin on Alzheimer's patients and people with PTSD is absolutely AMAZING! The stigma attached to psychedelics and even marijuana are slowly being replaced with scientific research and information not available 10-15 years ago. I hope someday soon this type of therapy will be available to those who would truly benefit from it.[deleted]macro dosing >>> micro dosing \s\syou should at least have one proper trip before you start a microdosing regimen in my opinion. microdosing is a mood boost and definitely helps with anxiety depression etc but it doesn't solve your problems. tripping can show you your thought patterns or repressed emotions that cause your mental problems to begin with and then you can work on undoing them and learning healthier ways of thinking with the help of microdosing.I really really REALLY want to try micro dosing.Microdosing is super fun but man is taking a lot of mushrooms terrifying.\s\sSource: ate an eighth tonight and met the devilLol it just triggered a manic episode for me.

Ron Hubbard of later Scientology fame (and infamy). \s\s> Sex Magick\s> \s> The degrees of the Hermit Triad are of a sexual nature. In the VIII¬∞ degree the initiate is taught masturbation magical practices in the IX¬∞ degree magical techniques related to vaginal intercourse and in the XI¬∞ a form of sex magick involving anal intercourse.\s> \s> The basis of OTO's sex magic is Crowley's theory of mixing of semen and female ejaculate released during the sex magic operation to produce an ""elixir"" which is then ingested or smeared on an object for magical purposes.\s\s--\s\s> The Babalon Working was a series of magic ceremonies or rituals performed from January to March 1946 by author pioneer rocket-fuel scientist and occultist Jack Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. This ritual was essentially designed to manifest an individual incarnation of the archetypal divine feminine called Babalon. The project was based on the ideas of Aleister Crowley and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel Moonchild.\s\sNot to mention what priests have been accused of as of late.

In many cases there have been accounts of UFOs entering or coming out of water. Its a fairly fascinating phenomenon. How they were able to launch out of water from what I understand the craft use propulsion technology that manipulates the gravitational field around the craft.The article is so dumb though.

Under some conditions it's possible that some may exist for tens of millions of years.Like 1000 + years in landfills. It‚Äôs crazy to think that whole civilizations could have existed and be swept completely away. But the earth is old and all the junk we create is actually pretty fragile. Even things like steel structures and giant wire/cables plastics and concrete objects. They all break down relatively fast when compared to a planetary timescale.Would depend on the plastic etchttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_CthulhuOne really interesting thing to consider is civilizations created by non-human animals or even human ancestor species. Trey the explainer did a really good video on it.Look underwaterUghhhh the picture from the ""Planet of the Apes"" is more accurate to this post that you can imagine ...\s\s(Change the present and future to past and present and America to Atlantis)Highly recommend you read the [actual paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/77818514AA6907750B8F4339F7C70EC6/S1473550418000095a.pdf/silurian_hypothesis_would_it_be_possible_to_detect_an_industrial_civilization_in_the_geological_record.pdf) over any summary of it it's not extremely technical and makes for a fascinating read.

When you put it into the perspective that studying this concept will aid us in studying other planets like Mars in the future to see if they could have had an advanced alien civilization millions of years ago it seems like such important research.It should be pretty obvious by now. I mean they've found evidence of water having existed on Mars right? And bacteria from meteorites from Mars so you would think *some* kind of life was there millions of years ago even if just microbial.[deleted]Nice.Best place to look is for trash on the Moon. What‚Äôs left there won‚Äôt change for millions of years.Bright Insight channel on YoutubeI like that guy!ThxInteresting read1000 years is about 1.6ft of dirt accumulated roughly. 10000 years is 16ft or the Clovis culture in North America. Yes that means you have to dig 16ft to find their axes pottery arrow heads that‚Äôs why archeologists are always digging. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúUpper paleolithic‚Äù vs ‚ÄúLower Paleolithic‚Äù lower being older. \s\sA million years is 1600ft. That‚Äôs about a third of a mile or 5 football fields in length. The average depth of oil is about 3600 feet or about twice that much.\s\sDigs are extremely technical and need to be handled delicately and we barely find anything. It‚Äôs hard enough to dig anywhere on this planet but to dig 1600ft delicately seems near impossible. I‚Äôm afraid unless we already know of a civilizations remains were not going to find true archeological evidence. Archaeologists knows this. That‚Äôs why this field is so difficult it seems that Mother Nature has put an artificial cap on us about how much real evidence we can uncover and there‚Äôs no way around it. Unless plate tectonics push them up but that seems highly unlikely.\s\sFyi - The pyramids are a little different they were buried under sand according to the scale above but sand is easily removed and preserves what‚Äôs underneath. El Castillo of Mesoamerica was all but buried under the forest when we found it.Millions of year LOL\s\sJust tell me what the weather is gonna do at least 12 hours from now. Yeah I thought so...Wouldn‚Äôt you like to know weather boyAccording to The World Without Us by Alan Weisman it's possible for bronze items and some types of ceramics to last for most of the predicted future lifespan of the planet. It doesn't specifically say but it seems likely that they would be best protected in stable geologic layers protected from physical erosion by water or sand and not somewhere that will be subsumed back into magna. \s\sThat would be something to look for that didn't seem to have been mentioned in the article.\s\sEdit: I've also read somewhere that some of our mining locations the giant pit mines such as the Bingham Canyon copper mine might be identifiable as at least anomalous (if not necessarily created by a technological species) by future geologists for tens of millions of years depending on how the landscape erodes.Michael Cremo is an author who has studied this.

It seems pretty clear that the kinds of life we have on the surface of Earth have it pretty easy comparatively speaking to possible life elsewhere. It looks like carbon-based life is the logical form to be found but that does not mean there may not be other mechanisms elsewhere. After all the universe has had hundred of millions of years if not billions for random combinations of atoms to form and do something. But anyway the ocean floor is a logical place to look for uncommon life forms although I suspect some trailer parks are also fruitful that wayWe found this at the bottom of the ocean so now we know this must exist on another planet üòÇüòÇYeah didn‚Äôt they find some exotic gonoreah in Antarctica?

Why bury it?Key word suggesting it‚Äôs still all speculation but kind of interesting I guess.As an astrobiology major  I can assure you we will never fully understand life lol can't wait till we find evidence of it elsewhere.Once again scientists have found out that we actually know nothing about life.[deleted]Actually scientists have speculated a lot about stuff like this. It‚Äôs a common thesis that life may have formed on clay minerals at the bottom of the sea floor.We know life needs light. Now we found life doesn‚Äôt need light but oxygen. Now we found that life doesn‚Äôt need light Or oxygen or much of anything.

Who do you think you are?!?!That is some strangeness on a biblical scale. China is the huge persecutor of Christian and other religious minorities. I'm just saying...Grackles normally flock in winter in Texas. Not unusual.It's a government made distraction. What was the biggest thing in china before all of this nonsense? If you answered massive protests for freedom you'd be correct. Now all of the sudden it stopped? What a joke. Governments dont even hide corruption anymore.Except China has been trying to cover this up. They are underreporting the infected and death counts. Airlines have shut down travel to China and neighboring countries are closing or considering closing their borders. Their economy is taking a hit. Why the hell would they do that intentionally?They gona die.km UK ads1sq9eraI'm convinced that crows are planning to kill all humans and take over the planet. I have to wonder if they can smell dead bodies in the dwellings... I really hope not...I kinda believe that with turkey vultures at least.  We semi-joke when the neighbors house is covered with turkey vultures it's probably time to check on them.Like walking into a meat cooler and being struck by the infamous ‚Äúrotting corpse‚Äù smell...only to discover a case of chicken that fell down between the racks...who knows how long ago. Hope you didn‚Äôt want chicken for dinner....YUMI suspect this is what it must be if it's indeed ""a thing""Don't worry crows have an absolute shit sense of smell.One of the theories is that the virus came from bats.  What if the virus is killing a large number of bats which has allowed the mosquito population to boom (perhaps the bats‚Äô main food source)?  Then the crows come in to feast on the mosquitos.  I dunno just a wild guessThat's entirely plausible. Or it could just be a giant coincidence. Either way it does *appear* highly strange if not *somewhat* ominous.They think the virus doesn't actually kill the bats just infects them and spreadsThis is actually not from bats.. you should look at some of the research coming out. This is probably a man made virus and has segments of hybridized genes in it as well and HIV segments. Doctors working for the wuhan disease institute warned their family and friends that there would be a virus coming out and they were fired a few weeks after the outbreak..[deleted]With a current outbreak of Dengue Fever in Brazil & Caribbean Islands (as of Dec. 2019) I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a shortage of mosquitoes anytime soon....As far as the crows it‚Äôs a flesh fest there right right with the mounting corpses.....The virus was manufactured at Harvard from bats. The crows probably are smart enough to know people are sick and are waiting to eat them. The mosquito might be attracted to whatever chemicals were added so it could be easily dispersed.Come join the murder.The Stand but in real life.Watched this last night!Kaw!

Crows are known to scavenge corpses so it could hypothetically be the smell of death they're attracted to and the smell of blood with the mosquitoes presumably. \s\sOr as I said prior it could just be entirely coincidental. Either way not exactly the most re-assuring sight if you were unfortunate enough to be in the area.They can smell death. Would like to know what China isn‚Äôt telling us. Feel like things may be past the point of no return by the time we find out the truth.[deleted]The video of the crows was posted on January 28 2020.

Most likely that isn't the case. Along with thousands of UFO reports there are thousands of eyewitness recounts of abduction by extraterrestrial beings ranging from the usual small Grey aliens to other different looking ones on these UFOs. So if these UFO reports are real these first-hand recounts are probably all real too. No point for a bunch of people all across the world to fake these stories imo.The fact that some of you had to wait for the government and the news' permission to believe or at least entertain the idea of real UFOs is the real joke.We have all the rights to be hipster as fuck regarding UFOs toward the fucking normies.When disclosure finally occurs the army of dedicated debunkers who currently shit up every UFO forum with denialism and scorn are immediately going to start pretending they were believers all along. Like Homer and the Springfield [Isotopes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miQm1lcsCSk).Some people think that if extraterrestrials ever visited Earth how could any of the world's governments keep it a secret from the rest of the population.You're putting way too much trust in the system and that's why I'm telling you that you are naive.\s\sYou are assuming that the system will feed you back all the information and that the scientific community would be on the case.\s\sThere's still a social taboo surrounding this subject and that alone is enough to deter further mainstream investigations.Any way around the pay wall?\s\sEdit: Nevermind.

The whole garlic thing you‚Äôre talking about.I JUST watched a vsause video about the garlic thing!!Wtf?Thats some broken matrix stuff right thereBecause boats and planes totally don't exist.This a beautiful story. So glad she got it back. Someone picked it up where she left it maybe a Finnish tourist or a future tourist to Finland who then went back to Finland where they lost it themselves?There are obviously tribes or even civilizations lost to history of of scant mention that where either taller or shorter than normal sized people of their times.  This can be for various reasons from genes in a small breeding pool diet altitude or other environmental issues.  I often find myself frustrated by the claims of a conspiracy theory based on government raciall or religious reasons to suppress the knowledge of giant or pygmy remains when all cultures and major faiths have tales of such people in their various ""holy stories"".\s\sScience now believes that modern humans have the DNA of 3 different bipedal species.  However remains of only 2 of those 3 have been discovered in the fossil record. The third has been found in the DNA of modern day West Africans. My point being that modern science would be all over any such ""odd"" remains trying to find more physical evidence of missing links in the evolutionary chain.  The scientific community social media and the modern media are both past the point of blindly cooperating with blanket information suppression policies from most countries now in 2020 to keep such breakthroughs secret.Clickbait title. Clearly there‚Äôs nothing secret about thisSecretists *hate* him!New Zealand has no archealogical digs because the Maori people claim that anything that pre-dates European colonisation belongs to them and is ""tapu"" or sacred.  Anyone who questions whether they were the first people to settle New Zealand is called racist even though Maori's own oral histories talk of other races being here long before they came.  It's a PC nightmare and annoys the fuck out of me because proper archeaology done in NZ would be incredibly fascinating considering our unique geographical placement.We deal with the same exact shit in the states. There have been so MANY giant bones found here.Yep they are pretty quick to pull that card out of the deck even if you have absolutely no interest in anything racial and just want to see what people might dig up.Seems interesting. I like reading about the lost races of giants theory. Always entertaining. I shall read more about these guys though. I‚Äôll admit I got a little vexed when they just throw racism out there. If the intent is just to show history has an alternative tale  and not to dispute treaties or show who has a right to the land then the claim of racism is just lore typical bullshit. Stories of giants are pervasive throughout history. Many cultures with many myths. Some spoken as fact some are legends. My friend and I are planning our own trip to dig in America. He has told me the takes as told by his grandfather about the mounds that contain 10‚Äô skeletons. He also told me about a guy that was a lowlife not very well off who used to trade what he described as crazy looking bronze swords and many other items for cash. The guy said he found them in a cave. He would never reveal the location. I trust my friend. As we discover other variations of humans that existed at the same time as modern humans I can‚Äôt help but at least leave it as a possibility.Well said. It is intellectually offensive to accuse someone of racist intent simply because they want to investigate alternative history. It doesn't need to impact existing treaties or social compacts in any way rather to me the accusation of racism is a convenient red button to push in order to shut down a revelation that the historical record is drastically wrong.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sEDIT: What is racism exactly? Accepting the oral history of the Maori as historically accurate where it fits consensus and designating it as folklore embellished through retelling (i.e the wise men tasked with conveying knowledge were prone to arbitrary  exaggeration) when its claims inconvenient?\s\sHere (from OP's article);\s\s>Talk of cover-ups and academic conspiracies frustrates archaeologist  Sian Keith. ""One of our jobs as archaeologists is to assess retrieve  and analyse the data from historic sites"" she says. ""We work with  tangible evidence scientific dating environmental analysis and  **engaging with iwi and hapu who have a rich oral tradition**. There are  many specialists working in the archaeological field who are passionate  and thorough.  \s>  \s>""The evidence for pre-MƒÅori inhabitants of any origin simply isn't  there. If it was the professional community would have identified it  and it would be common knowledge. Archaeologists are not secretive the  work we do is carefully managed under the [Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2014/0026/latest/DLM4005414.html) and investigations and excavations have to be formally reported on.""\s\sSo here is an example of that rich oral tradition;\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>There is the story of Kiharoa a giant of the Ngati-Raukawa and Ngati-Whakatere tribes... The story has it that he was twice the height of an ordinary man and he wielded a hard-wood taiaha of unusual length and weight...It may seem slightly exaggerated; **but let us be generous and allow that he was at least eight feet**.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>There was another giant of these parts long ago one Matau; like  Kiharoa he was a man of the Ngati-Raukawa tribe and too his  favourite weapon was the taiaha. He lived on a hill above the Wairaka River a few miles beyond Orakau. Maori accounts aver that he was **eleven feet high**.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>In the Rotorua country too there are stories no doubt based on fact  of huge warriors of the past. There was the chief Tuhourangi for one;  he lived three centuries ago. **He was nine feet high according to  tradition and was about six feet up to his armpits**. His bones were  buried on the east side of Pukurahi Pa on Mokoia Island above the  present little settlement on the flat.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThe article continues: [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Pom01Lege-t1-body2-d36.html](http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Pom01Lege-t1-body2-d36.html)\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSo you accuse someone of racist undertones for exploring what is literally described in oral tradition? Or is the real racism selectively filtering what parts of the ""rich oral tradition"" are taken seriously and which are dismissed?\s\sAlways dig deeper.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sEDIT 2: Please note the Maori themselves talked of pale skinned (and red haired) ""Fae"" folk that inhabited NZ: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patupaiarehe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patupaiarehe)So the guy was a lowlife because he ""wasn't very well off""?

In case you don't make it back.I haven't watched this documentary yet (going to tonight) but it's an investigation of the legends of pre-Maori settlement of New Zealand including the claim that Celtic giants (well a race of 7 foot tall people) lived here long before Maori arrived whose remains these people are presumably searching for. *New Zealand*: *Skeletons in the Cupboard*  [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf\_inGOubEg*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf_inGOubEg)\s\s[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g15ROUH3gAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g15ROUH3gAQ)\s\sedited previous link to a different upload of the documentary (in two parts) with better audio :)Though you didn't do any favors for my productivity tonight (lol) I wanted to say thanks for those links!

This fungus will evolve according to evolutionary standardsOf course this comes from foxnewsI wonder if mushrooms are growing thereLife uhhhhh finds a wayHaha. Came here to say exactly this.Fuck Jeff Goldbloom man!Crazy when you think you know something and the universe proves you wrong.So does cannabis. When it grows it absorbs the radiation from soil. Paul stamets has some youtube lectures about old world mushrooms and how expired oyster mushroom kits break down oil into usable fungi carbs.Is it edible?[deleted]Anything is edible if your cajones are big enough.How do you eat radiation?Plants have been doing it for \~2000000000 yearsVery carefully.Just like the ones they found that eat plastic.*nom nom nom mmmmmmmm radiation*Engineer it stronger and send to Fukishima.Where it literally grows out of control covering every available space of land. Until a giant fence is erected to stop its growth. Reminiscent of the continental spanning rabbit fence in Australia. All people are evacuated and sent south of the wall. Forever known in Japanese Annals as ""Green Retreat"". A source of national shame and renaming the territory north of the wall ""Moss Chan"".Doesn't surprise me. A bacterium cleaned up lead in the great lakes. Another ate up rust at the Naval Ship yard. There's an eater for every thing.Saw an old doc about fungus it seems that most fungus has a talent for breaking down all sorts of human chemical wastes and renewing the soil back to a state safe for human use. Problem is when these corporate wankers learn of this shit it gives them carte blanche to do whatever they want. Even more so.What if fungii are the ONLY tech left over from previous technologically advanced societies?Paul stamets has been open source copyrighting these I believe.  He calls it mycoremediationThat's awesome! Now if they could cultivate it. Grow it. And send it to Japan. Things can finally start getting cleaned up.First thing I thoughtThis has been known literally for decades.Wonder when the mainstream will finally admit mycoplasma.Mankind has this ignorance of nature and continues to pollute everything and everywhere. Nature is just so incredible always trying to find a way to erase our mistakes. What we need to do is find out what else eats radiation and or radioactive waste by dumping it everywhere like the ocean the rain forest Antarctica and my favorite the Hawaiian islands. Just dump it in the volcanos watch the lava break it down and when it cools down I‚Äôm sure Mother Nature will ‚Äúfind away‚Äù to get rid of it. Maybe sea creatures can absorb radiation or eat radioactive waste and make it safe for everyone. We won‚Äôt know till we try. This could be the first steps in living in harmony with nature.So were these the mushrooms that made Mario big?

I agree would be nice to see footage for once.There are great horned owls in Chicago they have a 5 foot wingspan and I have seen them myself on the lakefront in the daytime (NOT hawks I know the difference). The day I saw one there were wildlife photographers out there with a massive camera and they showed me the owl. It was fucking HUGE and a bit terrifying.

You guys are the worst alien people ever.that .... or a lot of people are new to the topic and are finding out this now by us sharing stories that may be older but are not known by the general public.Always keep in mind that it's possible that what is megastructures for us it's just a structure for them. lot of people assume that alien lifeform is around same size or smaller than human.I want to say that there are physical limits as to how big life can be but I‚Äôm not so sure what the building blocks of alien life would be. DNA? Then there is a limit. Something else? We have no idea..For all we know the whole area of space could be sorta like a petri dish with little things that can live in space like tardigrades just bouncing around maybe 100ft in length. We just wouldn't be able to see them because they wouldn't ever blotch out a whole star or anything and are small enough to not be seen by our shitty telescopes. Maybe we just haven't found the organisms that actually exist and eat each other in space lol If they were there would we even have seen then yet?(please know I do not take this idea seriously)\s\sAlso like we are just.. I see humans as just one step into conscious reality. We are juuuuust enough sentient to know that we are on in a Universe and have a self being confused about what created us. Puts us one notch above the animals but not really. If there are things that can even see 0.05% more of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can pick up with our senses sight taste hearing visual light smelling.. If we could ""see"" even 0.05%(or some other random percentage) of ""it""(being what is actually going on) we would have evolved technologically much faster I assume. And we would also know more about pretty much everything..\s\sThe Universe around us is teaming with shit that we are not even capable of understanding. If something else understands it and is ""higher than us"" it wouldnt even probably care about us? so theyre killing their planet? Who cares... It is alright the planet will just rebuild itself when they wipe themselves out planet will be fine"" . If it experiences time which we do at a certain pace if it experiences it faster what if a few thousand years only feels like one year to a weird tortoise-like interdimensional alien who is sentient? How fast does an ant experience time? They live such a short life does their individual life feel like an entire life? Or does it feel like a few weeks?\s\sThere are just too many questions. So many things are possible... So many.. We are one step above an ape. We know nothing. The closest we even get to seeing more of reality is our meditations psychedelic drugs and other altered states of consciousness.\s\sThis stuff is fun as hell to think about. We make sooo many assumptions on what another intelligent being would be like. And we don't even know. It could very well be something that we literally CANNOT IMAGINE. As in our brains cannot handle the load of understanding and they never would or could. I think that is how we should look at things as being almost entirely blind. Then let the imagination run wild.  Being blind isn't a bad thing it is an interesting thing.If they find a Mass Relay can we all collectively agree on the imminent Reaper threat?'Aaaah the *air quotes*  Reapers'We can't even all collectively agree that we live on a spheroid so good luck.Assuming direct control...I'm signing up for jump zero.

Obviously people are trying to find other intelligent life. It could easily be assumed that there are many fundings of the such.For me it‚Äôs an official acknowledgment of the High Strangeness that I thought was important. I personally wouldn‚Äôt mind if more of this was less strange and more scientifically verified. Not this sub but the phenomenon. I like strange Reddit.This is because of the ruins they found in Antarctica which contain a map to other alien megastructures in our galaxyLink?Lol as if NASA haven't already found this shit.

This is where i want it to go.Lol finally Washington using our money in a way I like.Good better then more tanks the army says they don't need.Also not true. We print so much money every year a massive amount of the money we spend isn't collected from taxpayers. At a macroeconomic scale you don't have an income in costs out budget like that. These are massive systems that literally print their own currency; with a global system of exchange and support on top of all of that. \s\sNot saying its free to do things if your a country. Just that these concepts are significantly more complicated than ""taxpayers pay for it"" to the point that that statement is just objectively falseEditors these days: Let's discredit our own thesis right in the headline. Betcha we still get massive clicks.There‚Äôs no need for megastructures. The Dyson sphere is a glorified solar panel. It even assumes the sun will be the main source of energy. By the time a civilization is capable of making a megastructure it won‚Äôt need it. This reminds me of when people in the 1700s thought they‚Äôd be using balloon vests in the future to walk across lakes. It‚Äôs type zero civ thinking for a type 2 civ.The Dyson ""Sphere"" is a misconception that has filtered through popular media. Freeman Dyson - who formulated the idea - never said it should be a solid shell around a star but a massive ball-shaped swarm of thousands of habitats solar power stations installations etc. which would obscure the light from the star.\s\sSo when you see a ""Dyson sphere"" mentioned think instead about a ""Dyson swarm"" and you have a much more accurate picture in your mind.I loved Civ2.Wouldn't it make more sense for a civilization to make smaller stars to actually power their tech? We already know it's possible to make a star in lab conditions though those only last for brief seconds and requires far more energy to produce than can be retrieved. We need to start thinking outside the box when it comes to searching for intelligent lifeforms.Can‚Äôt believe no one else is talking about this. Dyson spheres are a ridiculous idea. Some sort of megastructure? Maybe. Dyson sphere? No.>There‚Äôs no need for megastructures. The Dyson sphere is a glorified solar panel.\s\sThese statements are two separate discussions. Yes the Dyson sphere concept is probably a redundant one for the reasons you mention. It's like ""We have the imagination to build a sphere larger than our sun but not enough to journey to other stars."" On the other hand Freeman Dyson's idea created discussions and caused SETI researchers to broaden their search terms.\s\sIs the first statement as solid in its logic? Saying there's ""no need"" is a bold comment considering how little certainty there is in the subject. It's not possible to conceive of every circumstance and it's unrealistic to set a limit on the scale of structures for hypothetical civilisations.\s\sThe intermediate stages between populating local planets and travelling to nearby (light years) systems might lead to megastructural way stations and halfway points. Type 2 civilisations could possibly manufacture vessels we'd consider megastructures e.g. our largest vessels are transporters. I imagine that massive vessels will require even larger structures (and infrastructures) to build them. Furthermore there are ideas of ""super computers"" stationed in the spaces between planets where less gravitational pull allows for greater masses.  \s\sIt's a shame the writer chose to put ""Dyson sphere"" in the title as there's no mention in the article.I too considered this.  A Dyson sphere seems ridiculously impractical when you have fusion power at your disposal. Also‚Äî who knows what kind of potential energy sources are available that we just haven‚Äôt discovered?>  This reminds me of when people in the 1700s thought they‚Äôd be using balloon vests in the future to walk across lakes.\s\sThis is hilarious and feels really on point.With the low key talk about ‚Äòzero point energy‚Äô being used from the work of Nikola Tesla and even the US Navy‚Äôs ‚ÄúInertial Mass Reduction Device‚Äù patent a dyson sphere seems way obsolete and impractical to buildI've always thought about this.Ok if that‚Äôs zero civ thinking for type 2 civ. What is the analogous thought that a caveman would have had? Maybe ‚Äúin the future people will find a way to cook food using sun or thunder instead of fire?‚ÄùThe mass of material required for a Dyson sphere is probably a lot more than that of an entire planet.This comment here and scientists with PhD (Permanent Head Damage) actually spending taxpayers money to find Dyson spheres without even thinking.  \s\s\sFun fact aliens are already on Earth why look elsewhere?If NASA did find one of these megastructures do you think the materials used would be same as materials found on earth? Or something completely different and unrecognizable? Like do aliens have a different periodic table of elements? LolI'm no scientist but I assume they probably have a more advanced periodic table and whatever they are building with is probably some sort of alloy thats super durable. Like maybe never go away durable?It does not.  A first step in the right direction at least.  Maybe?Yeah let's just wait another 50 years until they confirm it's about aliensand it says nothing**Strangers**: Read the rules and understand the sub topics listed in the sidebar closely before posting or commenting.

Both led me to nothing in Google. \s\sI live in Denver. Have been to many ""hotspots"" around the state. I have also been to Skinwalker ranch. I want to check this Colorado ranch out. \s\sAnyone have knowledge of where this is?I once saw something crazy in Colorado.  We were supposed to be going to third bridge but we went to the wrong one either way all of our electronics died  or were dying fastand we all felt tired and anxious. When we got out of the car we saw this huge ball of clear matter. If you've ever seen predator it looked like that only about the same size and shape of a beachball. It came out from under the bridge next to where we had parked. We got the hell out of thereIt‚Äôs in north east Utah. 520 miles or so south of Ballard county.

Now it's even on a Bigfoot subBecause we're in a pandemic and people deal with stuff through humour?I get being skeptical I really do. I honestly still kind of am. But when one of the world‚Äôs leading primatologists says that the existence of Bigfoot (or something similar) is not just likely but certain how can there still be people who outright deny it?It's easy to ignore the evidence.  It's easy to ridicule people as crazy or seeking attention.  Some of them may be.  However if you truly look at the totality of evidence with an objective mind it's impossible to deny that there is something out there.  I was a skeptic myself until I really dug into the evidence.  Most people just don't bother looking into it.I agree! \s\sI would love to see a whole documentary with her exploring Bigfoot. Would be absolutely fascinating.> how can there still be people who outright deny it?\s\sA. Cause still there is no proff.\s\sB. A lot of experts have said occasional a really dumb thing or were wrong in their field about something.What was that clip they showed of the sasquatch when she first started talking about it? I have never seen that video before and it looked pretty legit. But the clips they showed for the ufo and loch ness monster were obviously not real so maybe the bigfoot was b.s. too.that looked like a shitty recreation of the OG famous bigfoot footage of him walking back into the forest. I could be wrong thoughLook folks it all boils down to this:\s\s**To prove the existence of Sasquatch you need scientific evidence. Scientific evidence is repeatable evidence!**\s\sVideo evidence might meet that criteria if was clear high resolution and taken on multiple occasions in a given area and made by a videographer with unimpeachable credentials like Jane Goodall.\s\sFootprint evidence you say dermal ridges you say? As a whole somewhat compelling but no single tracks are repeatable enough to meet the criteria. Lots of noise in the data as well because of hoaxers.Yeah - the thing is 'evidence' isn't evidence unless it could hold up in court. I'm not saying I don't believe these things aren't out there - but we need better evidence and the only way of getting that is if somebody sequences a DNA genome or has a body.they cut to a video of a shaky bigfoot footage anyone know what that is from?that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm trying to find out i‚Äôve never seen that clip but it looks really interesting!I would diarrhea right there on the floorI LIKE WHAT YOU GOT. GOOD JOB.Time to get shwiftyBurrito diarrhoeaWhy diarrhea? Maybe you should change up your diet.Came across these today the person who took them stated they are photos of a video taken in 2017 in Bailey Colarado (still waiting on if I can get hold of the original footage). The window was 8ft off the ground.\s\sWill add more information if I can find any.\s\sEdit: The creature was apparently hanging around their property for about two weeks after this encounter.\s\sEdit 2: Apparently the creature was swaying and kept closing it's eyes for long periods of time.\s\sEdit 3: The creature was scared off when his wife came in and screamed.\s\sAlso - I have been told that the original footage was on and SD card that was unfortunately (or conveniently) lost in a house fire. So this is all that remains of the footage.\s\sHoax or not I think they're still very neat photos and it's been interesting seeing how many people got such strong feelings of fear from them.I'd say it looks legit purely because of all the witnesses say they look into their window and the swaying that's really common chimps do that too.This is amazing. Have you been in contact with the person who took the video?[deleted]Wow this really creepy shit !! I mean wtf is this thing !!It was 8ft off the ground üò≥Bigfoot is an arsonistIf it hung around their place for 2 weeks they had time to get lots of additional photos right?Seems to me like a person with body modifications see the tree underdeveloped balls on their forehead and maybe they have nose expanders. Face tattoos and paint. Also the hair has perfect curls no other primate n no wild men  would have non messy hairr\sLooks just like homo sapiens dumbus to meThis just made me very uneasy idk what it is about it but the nerves are real with this picture.Holy shit yes. I couldn't tell what I was looking at at first and as soon as my brain processed it a chill ran down my spineCould that be a built in reaction perhaps out ancestors knew of these creatures and have past on the fright?Likewise It's like being zapped with infrasound in a way very unerving and the feeling when looking at these is very real!The amount of people that find this unsettling is really fascinating and eerie and I wonder if it adds to the credibility of it. Almost like this is tugging at a primal level of fear or uneasiness. To me this is one of the most realistic hoaxes/actual evidence I've seen.I was thinking the same thing It's interesting how many people are immediately freaked out by these images. I was as well they are just so striking and unlike other stuff I've seen which is why I decided to share.If it's a hoax it's a really good one. I just saw the images on my homepage before seeing the title and they made me feel really scared. It was weird.A lot of it's just uncanny valley response. It's something that looks almost-but-not-quite familiar where you can almost-but-not-quite tell what it is you're looking at. That unsettled feeling that urge to look away is your brain getting stuck in a feedback loop trying to sort what it's being fed into a known category.\s\sOnce you spot the nose it stops being quite as unnerving.Ehhh; I don‚Äôt think it necessitates anything in particular with regard to ‚Äúreal v hoax‚Äù. \s\sI mean PGF does the same thing of just hitting that right spot to induce a feeling. Doesn‚Äôt make it more likely real. It‚Äôs just doing that brain thing.\s\sTo me some of these pictures look like bad makeup. Some are utterly terrifying. So who knows.Am I the only one who doesn't find this unsettling?I think it's kinda adorable.Nothing can really add any credibility to pictures that are this amazingly shitty.Those eyes...üò¨\sThanks I hate it!It‚Äôs very unsettling especially the top left! if it‚Äôs a hoax it‚Äôs a unique one after seeing this I think I more prefer the gorilla looking ones to this humanoid beastIt really is! Especially since I‚Äôve heard so many accounts describing creatures that look like this ‚Äî like a caveman basically with a flattened nose and black eyes.You mean the top right?Well this is certainly unsettling.\s\sI'm having trouble comprehending the bottom center picture. Does it have its nose pressed against the window?From what I see - the nose is beneath the window ledge and it's eyes are closed.The person who took the video should post SCREENGRABS or THE ACTUAL VIDEO. Anytime a photo of a TV screen or monitor is shown instead it screams fake. Taking pics of a screen creates artifacts and other imperfections leaving the viewer to fill in the blanks because the image is not clear so we see what we want.Print it on a t-shirt and take a photo of it with an old Motorola flip phone... Enhance!!!If its a hoax its one of the best onesDamn this gave me shivers!  Real or not it triggered something in me.I'll say this much . that nose is spot on. Ive never seen one in real life but about 90% of the eye witness reports ive heard talk about the Sasquatch having a ""large  flat  pushed in nose."" As well as the skin color being ""battleship grey"". I too get a very creepy vibe from this one.If I woke up to that looking in my window I think I would pass out.And then after you wake up a few seconds later notice it's gone but hear the front door bust openIt looks like a California raisinHe heard it through the ape vine.RemindMe! 7 days ‚Äúsquatch‚ÄùI will be messaging you in 4 days on [**2020-03-21 09:49:57 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-03-21%2009:49:57%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/bigfoot/comments/fifv14/supposedly_taken_in_bailey_colorado_in_2017/fkgxn6w/?context=3)\s\s[**11 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fbigfoot%2Fcomments%2Ffifv14%2Fsupposedly_taken_in_bailey_colorado_in_2017%2Ffkgxn6w%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202020-03-21%2009%3A49%3A57%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\s\s^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20fifv14)\s\s*****\s\s|[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\s|-|-|-|-|I second the chills/uneasy feeling. But where exactly do these come from? Not ""someone took these in Colorado in 2017"" but how did OP find them? Email? Is there a website or article they were originally posted to? Even a blogpost?\s\sI googled ""Colorado Bigfoot 2017"" and while these images did not show up one did. One that at first I chalked up to pareidolia until I realized the ""face"" is eerily similar to the one in these photos. Not saying the same animal but same species. But it could also still very well be pareidolia.\s\sRegardless of that article my initial point still stands. Do we have a known original source for these images?\s\sEDIT: I also attempted to reverse image search this with no results.OP replied to a similar message stating he found them off of a Facebook post.I don't have much more information other than ""someone took these in Colorado in 2017"". And as I stated in previous comments I found them on a Facebook post yesterday where they had been posted for the first time so you wouldn't get anything from reverse image searching.\s\sSee my other comments if you want more info - I've provided everything the person who took them shared (which isn't much sadly).if u scroll thru here there is a facebook group link that links to the OP and the entire backstoryIn depth debunking here: https://squatchdetective.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/peeping-bigfoot-part-ii/Can any actual witnesses confirm that this is how they look?I started tearing up when I seen this. Gave off such a eerie vibe. I‚Äôm not gonna deny that this is real. Let‚Äôs be honest something we haven‚Äôt seen and actually get to see that we can‚Äôt comprehend our mind will do it‚Äôs best to convince us it‚Äôs fake simply bc we can‚Äôt comprehend. That made my hair stand upFor real tho im tearing up too when getting eerie vibes and cant find any info why that happensI like your explanation of the human psychology when it comes to things that ""shouldn't"" exist. Instead of letting their reality (that they have built up to this point in time) come shattering down or become fractured plague their mind most human will deny such a creature or thing's existence. Kinda gives more credibility to Lovecraft's stories where people go insane when they become psychologically conflicted from experiencing things they have seen that should be impossible...I find the opposite happens actually. I find a lot of people tend to think things are more supernatural than they actually are. Just looking at the comments on a glacier calving video and many people were absolutely convinced that some massive whale like animal was in the ice because of different colors of ice being underwater vs. Being covered in snow on top.Terrifying was the first thought that popped into my brain after it finally let me see what‚Äôs in these photos. The being/creature/(maybe human?)seems to be using its nose to be smelling something. Maybe the pheromones  emitted from the person/people inside are attracting it? Seems like it‚Äôs in a trance and if it was swaying then the pheromones could be having an effect on its neurology or something who knows right? That is... if it‚Äôs real. Pretty convincing to me. Seems to be something they‚Äôd do.. if they are really there.Could it be a curios bear looking for food?  Black bears can reach up to 8 feet in height on their hind legs sometimes higher.  It looks to me like a bear peeking in to see if there are any goodies.Wow talk about an extreme case of cognitive dissonance lol.The pictures looked like they were taken from footage on a TV or computer screen. Where did you get the pictures?They are camera pictures of a video that was taken in 2017. They were posted to facebook.I think this was from a video where the homeowner thought someone was coming around and stealing the fruit from his tree. This is pretty creepy.Were you thinking of [this video](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/W9LljI6) or a different one? This one also freaks me out a bit ‚Äî something about how quickly the glowing eyes dart back and forth just sets my teeth on edge.They always look sad to me.  I would offer him/her a bag of potatoes.I read one account (I forget where) in which a woman became somewhat familiar with a family of Sasquatches near her property and would set out food like apples and peanut butter sandwiches for them. Apparently they liked sandwiches made with wheat bread but ignored the sandwiches made with white bread. It‚Äôs probably just a work of fiction but it made me laugh all the same.STOP I HATE IT THIS SENT MY ANXIETY THROUGH THE ROOF\s\sit‚Äôs 5am and i‚Äôm holding back tears looking at that thing goddamnSorry it spooked you I hope you're okay.I love that feeling when I get so spooked that my eyes begin to water.Goddamn thing\sFTFYThis was wild I couldn't tell what I was looking at but when I did a shiver ran down my whole bodyWithout seeing the video or actual screen-grabs (which both aspects of that are iffy to start with) take a good close look at that nose. Seems a touch ... off.\s\sThe rest is easy enough to costume makeup and those BEK contacts. But prosthetics are a whole different level. And the nose just seems ‚Äòshopped to me. \s\sStill the most neat thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub in quite some time!! Thanks for sharing!!If the person can‚Äôt give you the full video it‚Äôs bs.\s\sKeep us posted though!I wonder if bigfoot can get diseases from humans. Maybe the poor thing had the flu.I‚Äôve heard it speculated that one of the reasons they are so scared of us is maybe one of our diseases reduced their numbers in the past like smallpox.Gotta admit that it‚Äôs kind of unsettling but I‚Äôm happy to see our big feet buddy.Really wish we could get the actual images rather than this screen photographed BS.Unfortunately that's how I came across these and how they were originally posted to facebook. I would also love the stills or even better the video they are supposedly from.Very unsettling. Those eyes....the swaying reports always unsettle me tooI will shit in my best and most expensive pants if I have to encounter that thingIt‚Äôs kind of cute in a creepy way. Whatever is out there has a heck of a honker. But seriously do I see evidence of a sagittal crest? One thing I‚Äôve read over and over is that a Sasquatch‚Äôs head is kind of tapered. Makes total sense if the Sasquatch people eat a lot of difficult to chew things like nuts.Peeping Tomüò±These look amazing can‚Äôt wait to see a video!Read other comments in the thread. OP said the video was burned in a house fire.Awww that top right one with those black eyes peering in is pretty creepy! These are really interesting though (although they are pretty fuzzy - why anyone cant actually get a crisp clean zoomed in shot with the smartphones we have these days still makes me suspicious)Smart phone cameras are wonky at best.

Well that's one of them.Hola fack!!!!Wheres the original photo? And contextLooks like the guy from Abominable! You know the one that bit that guy's face off like an appleThe Sasquatch Outpost is in Bailey been there a bunch since it's easy to get to from Denver. While there's definitely reports around there and throughout the Rockies it's a pretty convenient place to claim as the source of these shots especially if you're a hoaxer trying to gain some notoriety from a nearby Bigfoot museum.Top right is gonna give me nightmaresIt's 2020. Where's the footage?I don't know it seems a little convenient that one camera flash wouldn't scare it away. However it doesn't look like a mask.I second the chills everyone has mentioned. This terrified me something about the eyes is malevolent. \sAnd the fact OP mentioned it stayed still and swayed??? \sW T F. Hypnotism?This. This is why I live on a second story apartment and sleep with a shot gun.Update - So apparently the original footage was on an SD card that was in a house fire and these photos were taken before said fire. Make of that what you will.\s\sI still think these are neat pictures hoax or not!Ehh doesn't scare me. Just looks like a curious unidentified creature. Good chance it's fake anyway especially with the house where the original footage was kept being burned down.Oh wow... I don't have words. It's nearly impossible to say if it's real or not but it definitely hits something primal in me.Oof. r/TIHI. Gives off reallllll creepy vibes. I'm going to say it's a hoax buuuut a damn good one. Would be cool to see if the original video could be obtained.he is just having a little peek!Sasquatch: Hey bro just a friendly reminder that only you can prevent wildfires.Sorry everyone I really wanted to believe this one but Sasquatch Detective did a pretty in depth and convincing debunking: https://squatchdetective.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/peeping-bigfoot-part-ii/I might be wrong but bottom middle looks like the jack links commercial ""Bigfoot"".Kinda looks like an undead Mario with a bandana and buck teeth I def don't want to encounter that thing ever yikes.Can one of our artist friends please draw this version of Mario?\sStatSent a message to the original photo taker to learn more and to get his side of things. \s\sI'll share whatever I learn here.This is somehow one of the most terrifying bigfoot photos I've seen. The one on the top right creeps me out the most for some reason maybe because it's looking straight at the camera.This picture freaked me the fuck out when I saw it. Especially the top right picture. So then to make myself not as scared (and to scare my friends) I've begun using it as a chat sticker. Quite fun.I'm sorry what the fuck...?!creepyIt almost like like an absolutely massive pig nose lmaoSome creative guy put a digital cut out wide nose on a photo of some dude in adobe and used opacity setting to place it in another separate photo of the window. The nose has been smeared on for blending  Its a hoax sorry. \sI am not a non-believer at all just an adobe expert. I hate bad BS like this.Real or not Bigfoot or not I‚Äôd still be terrified if I saw this looking at me through my window. It could be a person and I‚Äôd still be terrified.What is with these pictures having such an odd effect on people? It definitely makes me feel uneasy as well. Those eyes are something else especially if it is some hoax..Look at the critter upside down and you‚Äôll see why it looks so weird.Scary as shit but it looks like a guy in black face with scleras lensesI think they‚Äôre cute although dumb because cmon don‚Äôt be peaking in people‚Äôs windows.\s\sEdit- I remembered that cats slow blink when they‚Äôre communicating ease and friendliness with you.My immediate thought is that I'm looking at the end of a dog's snout. Like when my dog is in my face waking me up in the morning. Given that it's 8 feet up is it possible it's a bear standing on 2 feet?Exactly. The shine above the ""face"" is the eyes of the dog and what looks like a face is the black nose of the dog. The 8 feet up is of course BS it's likely the frame of a patio door or something with the dog looking in.maybe from an indie film?Hello it me :3Wow that looks real that nose is big and those eyes oh my completely blacked out üò© i want to hug one but i would also be too scared too. They seem so cute how interested they seem when watching us ü•∞Noooooope. That is no Bigfoot that is definitely [SCP-106](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-106).Than it's easier to be SCP 1000I read the videos were supposedly lost in a house fire.Honestly the faces look like they could be CG renders. With the cellphone-picture-of-TV pictures we have here there's just no way of telling. Until somebody posts the original source I'm leaning toward hoax.That nose is bizarre. I thought it was African American type but if you look closer it doesn't feel it's human so... The face have some human features but also animal features. The skin is grey or burned the eyes are unsettling if its a hoax it's a very good job... You can't even tell the gender even if I will bet for this creature to be female.\s\sThe man claimed the smell was horrible and that drew his attention to this thing. You can hear other witnesses saying the same thing not only about Bigfoot and co but spirits.[deleted]I hate to be a downer but I think this is pareidolia. To me that looks less like a primate face and more like the snout of a hog shoving its face up against a window. I don't think those are eyes I'm pretty sure they're nostrils. \sThe scale compared to the size of the window and blinds feels wrong to me as well.Yes. Same. Exactly.Since when do hogs have forward facing eyes?How come we never see any fossils of these guys are they aliens in disguise?For comparison the first chimpanzee fossil was found in 2005 and consisted of a few teeth.funny you should mention that...lots of people dismiss the stranger encounters but they all follow the same bizarre criteriaRemindMe! 5 daysIt's the wookalar.Does anyone else think it looks like it's wearing some kind of headband? A strip darker than the rest of the forehead is visible across the forehead and in some of the pics (especially top center) the hair seems to have an impression in it in line with that strip like a headband pressing the hair down.üòÇLooks like a pig snoutIt‚Äôs definitely unnerving but assuming that Bigfoot is just a subspecies of ape makes it slightly less so. Gorillas and orangutans are generally pretty docile creatures so we can presume that Bigfeet would likely be similar in behavior unless of course they feel threatened.Cant make up my mind. Looks a lot like a guy with ""pearlings"" on his forehead some facial tattoos long unkempt hair and eyeballs tattooed black.Sasquatch are known to peak into windows occasionally. The reasons are unknown.Y‚Äôall are right. I forgot that houses are sometimes cinder blocks stilts etc. I live in big city where that doesn‚Äôt happen. But the full video has to be released before we can take this seriously. I know it‚Äôs apparently ‚Äúshaky‚Äù but that has to be analyzed.Top left looks like a nose up against the window... are those Nostrils.....Yeah doesn‚Äôt look fake at all...Any news on this?Yes it was fake.Thought it was a pig nose at first....holy crap this is terrifyingWhy would you put him in a microvawe?Man it's too bad that footage was lost... Really cool photos though!MAN I DON'T LIKE THATThat‚Äôs a man\s\sEdit: nevermind. Can‚Äôt decipher that middle bottom image.That‚Äôs just a really big and pissed off slug manThat‚Äôs just Bam Margera‚Äôs evil twin zombie brother who went missing 15 years ago.I'm an abductee.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThis scares the shit outta me.Do tell...I don‚Äôt know why people are seeing Bear. You can clearly see the humanoid nose especially on the bottom right then the eyes above itThe hoaxes never end!I think it would have to be a hoax because the top right one you see there is light reflected from the iris but not the rest of the eye as you would expect with an animal. In other words there isn‚Äôt any eye shine. \s\sStill creepy though.So the fact that there is an eye reflection would say to me that this is real. You dont see eye reflection on all photos of actual people. I don't know why you would think that there has to be eye reflection on all of these.That my friends is a black bearDamn. It kinda resembles a Native AmericanIt isn't a bear you snow flakes!Whatever this is it clearly is NOT a bear!I think that's George FloydSome of the photos just look overtly human. Paint on face just like the camo style you see in movies and with military stuff... That kills it for me.It looks like a dog‚Äôs nose to meBailey‚Äôs too close to Denver to be super believableI would try to communicate. If it kills me I don‚Äôt have to make loan payments.I would shit my pants if I saw thatSo now Bigfoot wears a backwards ball cap? You can clearly see the strap across his forehead ü§î Still a scary looking dude to look through your windows!Silly idea. People hunting a man shaped thing?\s\sMore hunting deaths would be a result. Idiots already take other hunters for deer. And a deer does not resemble a person at all.That's exactly the reasoning behind the ban on Bigfoot hunting in Washington.If people are mistaking people for deer then people are probably mistaking other things too... hmmmmmmmm Dick Cheney is so disappointed rnSee he's not trying to kill Bigfoot only trap him. Now its not crazy.it's* not crazy\s\s    it's = it is or it has\s    its = the next word or phrase belongs to it\s\sThe contraction gets the apostrophe.Not what I expected from the headline. I‚Äôd assumed they‚Äôd banned hunting them and that‚Äôs why people are upset. \s\sGotta say I really don‚Äôt think this is a good idea. Aside from the potential dangers of the alleged creatures (especially with people who probably don‚Äôt know much about the subject or the potential dangers involved) this could lead to people shooting at other people that they misidentify as being sasquatch. They shouldn‚Äôt be trying to promote tourism at all during a crazy pandemic. Pretty stupid idea all-aroundIts a trapping only hunt. No guns involved.I‚Äôm assuming people would have to pay for a Bigfoot-hunting license? If so then this is definitely a scam to raise money for the state.DING! DING! DING! We have a winner!The citizens here hate taxes so goddamn much that they won't even raise their sales tax by a penny to fund programs that will help raise them from the hellish existence that is Oklahoma. They will however buy hunting and fishing licenses so this is the easiest way for them to raise any money in this hell-hole.I mean it‚Äôs not a scam. It‚Äôs clearly intended to promote tourism and people will get exactly what they paid for.So they want to ‚Äútrap‚Äù a 7-12 ft. 800-1000lb thing that can snap trees in half...with no gun. Mmmm üëåMy thoughts exactly.So there are no other pressing problems in Oklahoma than bigfoot? Typical politician now all eyes are on him vote him out get someone more serious than this mental giant.Oklahoma the florida of the Midwest ...jeezOklahoma belongs to the south the midwest already has Nebraska/Iowa/Missouri. No thank you to Oklahoma.Bigfoot has rights as well. He has the right to live in his woods in peace just like anyone else. lolnah ain't buyin this bsThe thing about this is that the law in that there is an anti-hunting one in Washington.  The one in ~~Oregon~~ Washington is so that when people go out hunting they don't shoot a person that is mistaken for a Bigfoot.> The thing about this is that the law in that there is an anti-hunting one in Washington. \s\sWhile I agree with the sentiment this confusing jumble is disappointing coming from a wordologist such as yourself who is correcting several others IN THIS VERY THREAD. \s\s‚ÄúPractice what you preach.‚Äù -TestamentSorry i'm European and hence do not understand the idea of killing that (probably not existing) thing:\s\sWhy would you want to hunt/kill it at all?\s\s\- is it self defence? did it kill people? did it choke some cattle to death? does carry guns sell drugs ...?\s\s\- or is that you want to put the head as a trophy the wall of your cottage (which stands in the wild because you ""love"" nature)\s\s\- or because it is unknown and different? so it has to die because it's not according the the local standard?\s\s\- or would u want to make money out of hunting licenses?\s\sA scientific approach (*OMG did i say scientific in a bigfoot subreddit?!*) would make more senseThe idea is that it can't be real if there never are any body parts found.  So by killing one you can at least get part of a body.  Not many people will carry an 800 lb. animal carcass back to their truck.\s\sAnother reason is why it can't be identified through DNA matches. DNA matches have to be made against the DNA sampled from *known* species.  Otherwise there's no known sample to match to.\s\sThose are scientific approaches by the way.That's cute. I don't know why everyone is so upset it's not like there is a bigfoot to shoot.Thousands of eyewitness reports say otherwiseThere are a lot of reports from Oklahoma."

That is child mutilationBruh... don‚Äôt do drugs??AyyyGiggity. Yonaguni Monument underwater rock structure that was discovered in the mid-1980s near Yonaguni Island Japan. The massive underwater rock formation is thought to have existed for more than 10000 years. But whether it was completely man-made natural or altered by human hands is still a matter of debate. The theory is that the ancient underwater city was probably sunk by an earthquake or tsunami around 2000 years ago. Nevertheless this massive pyramid draws curious scuba divers from all over the world for obvious reasons.Where is there recording of it? Come on Japan has had archives for much longer. Dating it according to the WIKI is an exercise in stupidity. It suggests more recent than the 2000 years mark. Since it has been rediscovered since the 70-80s possibly prior to that. Although aired again recently instead of the natural formations attempted. Where there have been others discovered off of Japan more recently. \s\sAlthough Japan is located on massive seismic geology quakes and volcanoes where Godzilla the divine catfish krakens.\s\sYou'd honestly think there would have been another record. At least within the last 2000 years of Japanese history? Apart from the speculation if it isn't indeed older.I bet that butt shot helps with the viewsMany underwater cities that the authorities keep under wrapsActually they don't. If anything they just try to explain them away when brought up.They work with what they have. But just because you can't carbon date stone doesn't mean you attribute a structure to the last visitors or vagrants that left their trash there\s\sIf the world ended today and all that was left were the same things left by the earth's previous civilization. Those future archaeologists would find plastic bottles at the base of the Great Pyramid and decide the plastic makers built them.\s\s....also not every building with stone carvings was a friggin temple.>They work with what they have\s\sThey only work with what fits into their box. Evidence is often ignored because it points to things that they don't want to recognize.\sIn ten thousand years they will believe that we worshipped Coke.AliensWe are hybrids!The fossil record is but a very very tiny glimpse of extinct fauna.\sA fossil is created by phenomenal odds. \sMost extinct species will never make it to the fossil record.\sThat makes the fossil record irrelevant in attempting to prove human origin. Or any origin. Or evolutional processes changes and mutations.\sSo it will not be compatible.\sI have more faith in documented records. \sThe fossil record is unreliable.\sPeriod.By documented records do you mean human books/artifacts/histories?\s\sBecause those have at least as many problems as you point out for the fossil record (in addition to being subjectively created items and other things). \s\sWatch: The record of surviving documents is but a very very tiny glimpse of past history. A historical document is created by phenomenal odds. Most past documents will never make it to the historical record.\s\sSo why do you have more faith in documented records?In other words they cannot use the fossil record to account for all extinct species of hominids. They are still discovering new species all the time.\sThey still havent found the missing link.\sAnd they wont.\sCompare human skeletons to any fossil hominid skeleton. Our closest similarity is Neanderthals. All other hominids have totally different bone structure and density.\sThe rib cages of homo sapiens and everything else is completely reversed. Theyre upside down of each other. Other hominids bone density is twice as robust and heavier.\sThere isnt enough time to evolve to what we are from what they were.\sThat points to alternative origins itself.The fossil record cannot account for all extinct species of *any* organism group. They are discovering new members of groups all the time. The ""missing link"" idea [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_link_(human_evolution)) [not](https://www.britannica.com/science/missing-link) how evolutionary theory works.\s\sDo you doubt general agreements about other organism groups - like horses or whales or birds? The problems listed here are not so different from other debates in studies of organism groups' fossil records.>There isnt enough time to evolve to what we are from what they were.\s\sIt really only took us a few 100000 years to get from ""them"" to ""us"" which in evolutionary time frames is extraordinary. And in that same time frame half a dozen of our relatively similar cousin species went extinct/we killed them off and we went from living in caves to taking over the whole world. Are there any other examples of a species having even *close* to such a fast upward mobility in the food chain in present or past time periods? I can't think of any.I agree with your first sentences but just want to point out that all Neanderthal bones have been extremely dense! Much more dense than any other living hominids at that time/ us today. Most articles seem to agree that they were six times stronger than humans and needed denser bones to support their extra muscle mass.And if I remember correctly the first hominids with jaws that could speak were when hominids began working together to solve problems.This also happens in Egyptology.  The evidence doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into the official narrative that Egyptian Bureau of Antiquities perpetuates.\s\sI‚Äôve also heard that some early remains discovered in the US and Canada contradict the official history taught there (example: some Caucasian remains that predate the earliest known Native remains) but that such findings have literally been buried because indigenous peoples automatically get to claim them as ancestors and take possession... and it wouldn‚Äôt benefit ‚ÄúFirst Peoples‚Äù if there were questions about which people settled which lands in prehistory; it could be used as grounds to remove some of their special rights and they‚Äôve been screwed by the white man enough that you really can‚Äôt blame them.Its because there are huge political implications. Not just the natives or Egypt but also the Maori-first claims of New Zealand or the more blatant China heavily fudging history and claiming neighboring cultures and historical sites as theirs too.\s\sWith historical narrative comes claiming rights and sadly from there the issue is no longer confined to academia alone.ITT: Given an inch and take a mile""I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE""!

Among their incredible finds was the discovery of a man who was the product of incest in a 5200-year-old Newgrange structure in Ireland. Experts extracted DNA from the remains and noticed that it showed an unusually high number of identical versions of the same genes. This pattern suggests that his parents are either siblings or parents and child.The Irish had royals?!We had it all before the EnglishWe hear about these stories in the old Testament of Genesis.

This video was done wellthanks alotReally well done thank you!SnakeIf you look at the drake equation and contemplate the time span that the universe has been around ~15bn years there should be numerous alien species around that are far more advanced than us. Chances are aliens have been on/aware of this planet for millions of years. The sumerian tablets say the annunaki (an alien species from another star system) genetically modified a developing homonin on earth and that's who we are today. Seems reasonable if you think of the vastness of space and time but still people will laugh it off.they arent reptillian they are eagles. look up the story of enki and enlil. aslo the great inversion is a genius trick by devil as it makes the good guylook evil.The Ubaid era pre-Sumerian ( likely one of the tribes that joined with other nomads to become Sumerian) has numerous humanoid figurines with lizard/reptilian/serpent heads.  It is very possible this is the origin of the legends of serpents that gifted humans with various types of knowledge.  Enki was said to look particularly serpent like. Then came dragons feathered serpents etc. and the rest as they say is history.So do you just bounce between these different sheroze accounts and spam trash?Not aliens its all demonic anywaysAs a former fundamental Christian I really want the aliens are demons theory to be true. It makes things a lot easier to just explain all this alien stuff as demonic. But now I‚Äôm conflicted because if there is even the tinniest possibility real intelligent aliens exist then this Annunaki stuff is a very compelling explanation for our origins as genetically modified in some way.demonic??! ü§£lmfao don't drink the kool aidSummary. Now. The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in the state capital of Kerala India. The temple is named the richest temple in the whole world as it is covered in gold.

A large number of treasure was found locked away in the five vaults including gold silver diamonds and other precious stones.Perhaps these are similar to the Giants spoken of in the Old Testament and times of pre FloodI just did a podcast about this topic! How random to then run across this post. The Paiute  Indians do not consider this an alternative history at all. This is apart of their actual history.What‚Äôs your podcast?Lot of stuff can be found on these gigantic human beings. Ranging from 11 till 14 feet. I believe some even grew bigger\s\sAlso lots of skulls found which had double rows of teeth. A lot of stuff is kept hidden from usWhen they say double rows I always wonder if they mean like shark mouths or like a child‚Äôs skull that has baby teeth with adult teeth beneathLots of BS yeah. But nothing that qualifies as legitimate evidence.Red/Brunette hair isn't an unknown among Mongol or Negro ethnicities. It isn't exclusive to Caucasians. There are also many genetic anomalies such as Gigantism Cherubism and Acromegaly that could explain their unusual size and appearance.[deleted]Nothing at all to do with evolution.ouch...There are dozens of accounts of red haired giants living in the US territory before the Europeans arrived. Both by historians as well as depicted on official maps (in one map they are even described as cannibalistic).\s\sI don‚Äôt know if these particular skulls are legit but there is plenty of evidence to support the premise that giants once occupied the US territories.Probably a next gen evolution some of our ancestors killed off before they got prevalentSounds like the nephilimPlease please share one of these credible accounts.

There were never any bones. There are no native tales of giants. It‚Äôs entirely a creation of paranormal writers.\s\shttps://skeptoid.com/episodes/4390I saw an interesting video series a while back posing the idea that all these giant skulls were from early human denisovan hybrids. From the teeth found with denisovan dna it definitely seems possible these were just proto humans that all died offIt‚Äôs a shame considering numerous accounts and other evidence that hold validity..despite Smithsonian propaganda and suppression..this kind of shit is an embarrassment and sheds negative light on an otherwise thought provoking and monumental discussion of human historyThe SimpsonsThey've not aged well"

The Spanish Air Force declassified 55 UFO sightings but only four ever received a full investigation ([list here](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=137829)).\s\sGallarta was one of them where a carpenter named Juan Sillero claimed a disc-shaped craft landed near his rural home five times one of which he went on board and spoke with the ""beings.""  Among the things he claims he observed:\s\s&#x200B;\s\s* the disc seemed to be collecting samples of the ground\s* onboard there was a circular console with a red sphere in the middle that ""lit up"" when Spanish Air Force jets approached\s* the beings communicated telepathically with him\s* the beings he observed that didn't communicate to him were grunting to each other and waving their arms exaggeratedly\s* they warned him Earth's axis was ""tilting too much"" something NASA has recently analyzed due to Greenland ice melt and mantle convection (though they aren't worried about it)\s\sIt's a wild story but the Air Force concluded he was a reliable witness and was consistent in his re-tellings.  They ultimately didn't conclude anything landed due to a lack of physical evidence.\s\sYears later an official from that Air Region told journalist JJ Benitez (who covered Juan's case) that there were anomalous radar returns those nights in 1977 and they did scramble jets twice to check it out.  Curiously any mention of radar returns is omitted from the Gallarta case file despite the Spanish military disclosing this information for other sightings.\s\sFull case file (in Spanish): [http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp\_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda\_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886](http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/exp_ovni/i18n/consulta/busqueda_referencia.cmd?campo=idtitulo&idValor=395886)The planet Earth is spinning out of it's orbit better tell a random carpenter.Jesus was a carpenter.I'm tired and read that as a caterpillar went on board and wondered why they told him that.... and that explains MothmanThis video: \s\sHe asked for a souvenir and they gave him a special thingamajig.\s\sBut I'm sure that's not important so let's just forget we mentioned it.Best fucking paranormal channel on YT rn.

Because I can never seem to find a straight forward non rambling answer and I‚Äôm super fascinated in the man and his ideas.Do they pinpoint people who do something about it or did they know their visits would be seen as hostile by limited beings and their message hidden from the masses?Thanks for sharing :)Guys yeah. There are aliens that come to this planet but what are they here for? Every country or almost every country has its story with it. I suppose they come here to study just like we study biology history and arts. Why governments deny their presence? Why do they make such a deal out of it?They thought he could use his carpentry skills to build a space ark.So this leads me to another theory. If they know that the name of the planet is Earth what is the explanation for this? They are either us (from the future) or someone told them. Because in reality science only gives planets and any matter a name.The phenomenon offers a vision where ‚ÄúThey‚Äù often communicate telepathically. If something could read your mind it could know everything you do.I believe they are us from the future.

You hear about the thousands of people who claim they saw aliens or were abducted you don't hear so much about the thousands of stories of the men who follow\s\sEdit: everyone asking if I remember correctly it was I believe The real Men in Black by Nick Redfern. All my books are currently packed away in storage so I can't be entirely sure.Where can I find this book?Do you know the name of the book?Hey. Do you know the Name of the book?There's a MIB encounter that I read on the Internet a long time ago and sadly cannot find anymore. Here's the gist of it:\s\s1. The poster claimed that for LOLZ he most a post on some forum about seeing a UFO crash near his house and gave a specific location. \s2. The specific location was along a riverbed. There was only one walking track near the location.\s3. The poster stayed at the location to see what would happen. A MIB came past and they briefly spoke then the MIB walked off. Within a few minutes an identical looking MIB came by and walked the exact same way. There was no way that the first MIB could have come back in that time to do that.Sounds made up imoDoctor who?Where?I always wondered why UFO design descriptions along the decades also had a clearly line of design that is improving as ourselves as society had our asthetics being improved on what looks like the same rate of change. Maybe all UFO is a big subjective experience and the mind interpretation of the individual has a bigger role or maybe it is the greatest hoax ever.It could be that what they saw was so unbelievable that they have no frame of reference so they try to explain it using relatable things from the time.I strongly suggest the novel Roadside Picnic and the film based on it Stalker. The novel is about the aftermath of aliens visiting earth and the title is a metaphor for how if aliens visited they would likely not pay us any mind and leave behind junk like one might after a picnic. However because this ‚Äújunk‚Äù may be so far advanced for us we are fascinated and even unable to comprehend it.\s\sThe movie though in Russian is possibly my favourite movie ever. I warn you it‚Äôs incredibly slow but it‚Äôs amazing. It doesn‚Äôt really have much to do with the book but both are great!The Vallee-Keel hypothesis is more like ""ultaterrestrials have their own agendas and ideas and don't care too much about 'passing' here too much.""\s\sIts explored in Passport to Magonia from an early UFO sightings perspective but I feel Keel's Operation Trojan Horse does a better job explaining it.Here is the newspaper article: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5855523/first-hand-account/](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5855523/first-hand-account/)\s\s\^The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported his friends deemed the witness reliable.  There were dozens of other phantom airship sightings throughout 1897 including several where voices inside the craft were heard: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20173722?read-now=1&seq=2#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20173722?read-now=1&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)what if these ships in the past were actually us in the future trying to find ourselves in the present?I‚Äôve wondered about this exact hypothesis for so long. Glad to see someone else consider it too.That's what I've been saying all along UFO's are time machines!!!In 1897 also this [happened](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Texas_UFO_incident)  in Aurora TexasOw thats amazing! I would have loved to have gone and picked up a piece. I wonder what happened to the pieces? as it said lots of people were going out to collect them...What the hell does the picture have to do with this?It's a videoit only makes sense to believe that in the future our calculations are skewed/incorrect ones we derive from technology for space/time travel to meet ourselves before times recorded or recorded. science is made of factual events or plausible scenarios that have some sort of fact. i like the idea of inter dimensional beings moving through space and time that met our selves once before but it makes greater sense to believe we humans made leaps to go back in time to replace events for better ones. climate change world wars political takeovers etc. something about human nature and fixing our problems seems more heroic than abandoning life on our ‚Äúso called‚Äù terrestrial first world.In the romantic world of writing a good story maybe.  Real world it would be more like elon musk opening a portal to a safe reality for him and 30 billionairesThis opens the doors to two things: collective consciousness and metaphysical entities. It is possible for a group of people to experience something of an imagination together. It happens all the time in religion and could explain why UFOs mutate with the ages. The disturbing part in my opinion is that if these beings are metaphysical transcending our universe and dimension and are able to project whatever images into the witnesses mind‚Äôs we then are unable to understand them and considering their technology unable to protect ourselves from them.nicely written.Considering it didn‚Äôt have a spout I‚Äôm pretty sure it should be classified as a ‚ÄòGrotesque‚Äô instead of a gargoyle ü§îü§îConfirmed fantasist.

Didn't know I was in so deepHighly entertaining thank you!  I recall seeing a documentary or maybe it was a show like 60 minutes about a dozen years ago in which a contemporary of Patterson & Gimlin‚Äôs came forward and claimed to be the man in an ape suit.  In the show they even had him put on a hairy suit and walk the same path.  He did walk exactly like the Patty.  It seemed like a convincing debunking but today it seems as if the P/G film is considered a strong piece of evidence.  Do you know of the one I recall and what came of it?You should look into a more detailed breakdown of the P/G Film. There‚Äôs a lot more information that‚Äôs discernible from that video than a guy walking in a certain way. I recommend you check this out:  \s\shttps://www.isu.edu/media/libraries/rhi/research-papers/Munns--Meldrum-Final-draft.pdf\s\shttps://www.isu.edu/media/libraries/rhi/comments-amp-responses/Munns-&-Meldrum-Commentary_2013.pdf\s\sNo one who‚Äôs come forward claiming to be Patty has put forth a shred of evidence. They don‚Äôt have the suit they don‚Äôt have a picture of themselves in the suit and they can never get anyone to corroborate their allegations. That means it‚Äôs always their word against Patterson and Gimlin. \s\sPatterson stuck to his story till the day he died. His family continues to corroborate it. Bob Gimlin is still alive and he sticks to the same account as well. They never changed their story and they actually produced evidence of their claim. That‚Äôs a lot more than I can say for the hoaxers who allege to be the subject of film to get their 15 minutes of fame.I believe you‚Äôre remembering Bob Heironimous‚Äô recreation. As far as the walk goes I‚Äôm personally unconvinced.You can say what you want about the P/G film but my favorite detail that makes me believe it‚Äôs real is you can see the quad on it‚Äôs right leg jiggle when it steps and the calf muscle flex.As someone who lives near Mount St. Helens I want to know about the Mount St Helens bodies- is this in reference to that early 1900s incident of a supposed attack by Bigfoot or am I missing something something even better?Two events happened at St helens in the 20's was the ape canyon attack where miners shot one and where attacked all night. The second one with the bodies is reference to lots of tales of how the government took a few bodies recovered right after the eruption.very interesting video i didn‚Äôt know jack about bigfoot before i guess.If you believe BF is a natural animal like an ape or relic hominid I ask you to explain the sightings in highly populated areas like New Jersey Ohio Massachusetts.  And why no good photos or videos other than the PG film? Why no bodies? Every other animal is killed by vehicular impacts but not BF. why do the footprints disappear into nothing? Why the strange lights and other poltergeist-like phenomena that are frequently associated with BF sightings? Why are they shot at so many times and don't die?\s\sIt's because they are paranormal entities and will never be caught or killed.  BF is a super magic entity that will always be beyond our understanding or dominion.That the fantasy world next to the real world. That where they cast wizard magics and go poof. \s\sWoof that the underside world of the round moonsun that is of the daily changes of mana.It‚Äôs cool that there is an active cryptic showing up around the Midwest currently. I hope some good footage pops up.I really appreciate the analysis you put into investigating this case featured here. The specifics you make sure to include especially geographically. The comparisons to other similar cases nearby recent or not but still with dates included. That was a great addition to the article Most publications who publish material on the paranormal are blatantly sensationalist BS. Most of them do not have the qualities of journalistic integrity that your publication/investigative service seem to possess inherently. I look forward to reading some of the other reports by you folks at SF. This is very good stuff.The Michigan Dogman?If  they actually exist why wouldn't they do so in more than one place?Isn't the Dogman like well-documented as being a fabrication? The guy who wrote the song about it admitted he made it up and there was zero info about it before the song was releasedYup ole Dogman!Cynocephaly. They have existed in our history books for thousands of years.I saw something similar in AZ on the 93N towards Nevada. It had the head of a kangaroo no tail big torso long arms short legs like a gorilla. It moved quickly across the highway like a gorilla would (using the knuckles of their fore limbs).That's exactly how it ran in that video where it apperently attacked the camera man.""He said it was 6-7 feet tall and was walking around on 2 legs. ""\s\sThis ruins the account for me. We are very used to seeing six-foot people. We very rarely see seven-foot humans and it's eyecatching when we do. Uncle Jerry's effectively saying ""I saw a bipedal creature. It was between perfectly-normal height and astonishingly tall.""6 ft is taller than average and 7 ft certainly is. \s\sWhen was the last time you saw a large upright walking canine?I‚Äôm kind of surprised it didn‚Äôt see him. Maybe Jerry was such an experienced hunter that he could move around quietly enough. The terror he felt sounds unnatural; something not like what comes from seeing a regular animal.That‚Äôs somebody sister bro !

How often do visitors have red hair?Can you imagine if the lore regarding leprechauns started from people in the past witnessing these aliens?Looked like Mysteryon to meRick and morty in and outs.Could you imagine if these aliens decided to show themselves as Rick and Morty in these encounters? I'd be way more terrified of that than the Greys. HahaWhy would they even ask him? What the fuck is he supposed to say?\s\sIf he says ""no"" they could probably just kill him extremely easily and no one would know.\s\sAnd how would he survive on ""their"" world? Who says the aliens are even carbon based life forms that require oxygen and water? They could be silicon based organisms that require liquid ammonia and hydrogen gas to survive. How would the aliens know exactly what life support system to give him?Good questions but I would just assume if they've advanced over millions of years and are smart enough to build physics defying technology that can traverse the universe at the speed of light they probably thought of all of that and have the answers to those questions already. Plus asking that is assuming they didn't create our species in the first place and know more about us than we do.\s\sPlease don't take this as combative as that seems to be the default assumption on social media these days. Especially reddit. You make good points.I feel like they know that there are enough of us that will accept the terms. Plus the rate of speed they travel it wouldnt be any where near 7 years in our time. Check the experiment NASA did by sending one twin in space for a year he came back slightly younger than his identical twin brother slightly taller as well. I cant remember the scientific term for when time slows down but it is a literal thing!I would hope these beings know enough about us already for that not to be a problem... And they may just believe that it's immoral to kill and threaten people.\s\sIdk I believe all these different alien encounters aren't what they present themselves as being. Almost like they're studying how we react to these encounters more than anything else. They're consistently surreal and lacking in logic - to the point it gets to be hard to believe that people are making them up ironically.Sorry I'm just imagining them opening up the spaceship back home and the guy immediately inhaling an ammonia atmosphere and dying and the aliens saying ""Who knew??""Carbon is far more versatile and carbon-based life would always outcompete silicon-based life and maybe it already has on Earth.  There might be a lot more parallel evolution out there than we think because of the way molecules come together and interact. Some aliens might have iron based blood or hair or feathers or chlorophyll; they may shit brown and pee yellow and get drunk on alcohol. Why? Molecular chemistry.Well they came from a different planet they are probably here often an probably ain't the first human they ""asked"" this for. But i do like the idea of a silicon based life form advanced enough for very advanced ways of traveling. Theirs a curve that it takes a species a tremendous amount of skill intelligence and luck to make it past this curve before we destroy ourselves to be a very advanced species with a fancy name i can't remember right noww. Maybe the aliens finding us perhaps helping us advance is the luck we need.Def ask them about some alien weed and alien pussy then we could advance the ConvoAsk them about alien dick too man some of us are bisexual üëÄ I want to know about all the options..work for us first...then become specimen yourself..suuure well get you back home later..we never said alive..I'll have an oz of whatever hes smokin please. But ye in all seriousness if it is true then things are so far beyond the general public's understanding that even with solid evidence you'd get laughed out of the room. You'd literally have to put the alien leader on tv announcing he'd arrived and half the world would still be convinced it was cgi. Social engineering has been such a success that i doubt anyone truly knows exactly what the fuck is going on. Generations upon generations of brainwashing and rewriting history combined with good old propaganda. The true weapons of the people that think of themselves as the rightful leaders of this spinning rockHave you heard of Iran's account trying to intercept UFOs?

From the Pleiades star cluster Eduard Albert Meier That predicted the Iraq War AIDS and global warming. \s\sThis is in 58. \s\sDuring the course of researching thousands of pages of information Meier claims the extraterrestrials provided Horn and other researchers have found over 250 examples of specific previously unknown scientific information that Meier published up to more than 60 years before ""official discovery"". Ironclad proof that Meier published the information first is established by internationally recognized copyrights.\s\sConveyed in the clear language of science and subsequently confirmed by NASA discoveries is information about every planet in the solar system as well as black holes the speed of gravity the impending threat posed by asteroid Apophis and terrestrial environmental seismic and volcanic events etc.\s\sIn his presentation Horn will also show Meier's pre-digital era UFO photos and films which were authenticated by independent photographic and special effects experts beginning in the late 1970s. In 2017 former top investigator-supervisor for the USAF Office of Special Investigations (OSI) Joe Tysk analyzed Meier's even earlier UFO evidence from 1964 and concluded that it was indisputably authentic.\s\sMars\s\sIn addition to providing the evidence to Prof. Loeb Horn also brought it to NASA-USGS scientist Ken Herkenhoff who specializes in Mars astrophotography. In a recent conversation Herkenhoff told Horn ""I should say that I have long hoped that we have or will be contacted by advanced civilizations and that we could learn from them and that the statistics of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy suggests that there are probably many advanced civilizations.""\s\sRegarding Meier's information about lightning on Mars Herkenhoff said ""I have not heard of any observations of lightning on Mars."" It's not widely known that NASA first observed lightning on Mars in 2009‚Ä¶22 years after Meier verifiably published it in 1987.

I didn't even know about the Lovelock Giants until years later when I found a mention of them on the internet. It was like reading another side to what my Grandpa told me.\s\sIf you look more into this you can find Nevada News print articles of the Lovelock Discovery online the last that was ever known of the remains was that they were sent off to the Smithsonian and the trail ends there.Yeah and it's kind of suspicious how the Smithsonian ""lost"" the remains right? I thought I watched something that made it seem odd that the Smithsonian of all places simply can't find evidence of it.I went to high school around that area of northern Nevada and have never heard of this; I'm gonna have to ask my rez friends if they know any stories. It's amazes me to ponder what we don't know.Its possible that they were a remnant of  Viking explorers......many many generations of inbreeding and isolation and this is the result. There is evidence that the Vikings did manage to get a really long way inland into the US continent by sailing up the river systems. But eventually they were devoured by the endless forest and couldn't find their way back. That seems like a real and logical possibility to me. Gigantism is a possible result of inbreeding within a very small gene pool....it would also explain the fair skin and red hair. That makes the most sense to me.Awesome storyThis is really fascinating stuff thank you for sharing.

[https://youtu.be/66MbXX3qDBE](https://youtu.be/66MbXX3qDBE)BONKI live a few hours from Lovelock but I'm only a few miles out of the paiute reservation.  The paiute legend says that there were giants with red hair that would prey on the paiute people and that the giants lived in caves and refused peace saying that they would attack and eat paiutes given the chance.  The  skeleton found in the cave was about 6' tall  and some bones recovered with it were from cows and it was mistakenly referred to as 'giant bones'. The mummified remains in the cave had fragments of reddish hair which is due to the hair oxidizing in the earth meaning the original color can't be determined. Some people think it was a tribe of Neanderthal or Neanderthal hybrids that survived extinction for a few thousand years  and due to their physical differences to the paiutes they were seen as monsters. Neanderthals were also known for violence against other tribes and occasional cannibalism during ceremonies and times of low resources. \s\sHere's an article on the science behind it\shttps://nevadagram.com/the-red-haired-giant-cannibals-of-the-lovelock-cave/That‚Äôs for the great write up!youre right about the canniblism thing i think i remember hearing about a skull being found bashed open supposedly used as a bowl/cupThe info is really interesting but the guy narrating is hard to follow.

Further when our flesh decomposes including the cartilage bits that keep us together our bones spread outward. Adding a few inches with every little bone can make us look super tall. This is where a lot of so-called giants get their origins from people not terribly familiar with anatomy. \s\sEspecially when NAGPRA is initiated due to obvious tribal concerns things are handled privately and respectfully making people believe there's some kind of government coverup. \s\s(There are also bones from other animals that regularly get confused for human bones and other things like that too.)That's just what a giant would say....Ben KisselIt's pronounced Py(pie)-YootNephilim?r/HomoGiganticusMy best guess here is that they were members of a culture that bound skulls and red hair is a genetic mutation so it‚Äôs possible that they all were of a single lineage. Maybe iron dyed the hair as well. The weird shaped skulls also lends credence to my theory that they are a family. They could all be suffering from a genetic disorder like Gigantism.These look just like the Paracas skulls.[https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/breaking-new-dna-testing-2000-year-old-elongated-paracas-skulls-changes-020914](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/breaking-new-dna-testing-2000-year-old-elongated-paracas-skulls-changes-020914)\-\s\sI don't think these are human.

Neither Bohm Swann or Targ were Theosophists nor has the concept of the Akashic records ever come up in any of the work that these men participated in. Swann was the man that originally coined the term ""Remote Viewing"" and ""Astral Projection.""\s\s>which he believed contained the key to understanding how the universe  unfolded from a kind of Universal Mind that pervades the entire cosmos  at all times.\s\sBohm took this idea from Carl Jung's theory of the Collective Unconscious.\s\sSwann went down the rabbit hole later in life and started making a bunch of weird claims about his time with the CIA. Romanticizing and probably just making shit up towards the end about Top Secret projects that never existed to begin with. The CIA dropped the programs because the statistics couldn't justify the financing for the projects. Even Swann's remote viewing only had a marginal success rate. He continued this work later on with Jacques Vallee without much success.\s\sListen to enough Coast to Coast AM radio over the course of your life and you'll hear all about Ingo Swann and Targ. Art Bell has a few shows with Swann from the archives that are worth a listen.Check out [Itzhak Bentov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzhak_Bentov). He work with the CIA on remote viewing and many other psychic experiments. Somehow he mysteriously died in a plane crash.

In this respect he was not merely engaging in quantum mechanics but sub-quantum mechanics which he believed contained the key to understanding how the universe unfolded from a kind of Universal Mind that pervades the entire cosmos at all times.

The section which describes the degrees and sex magic as well are also fucked up describing situations which don't take place. Sex is discussed as union - search alchemical marriage. Lon Milo DuQuette discusses the sex magic portion of the OTO as just that. As well his chosen map of terminology is far different from Crowley's chosen map of terminology which includes the marriage of Whore and Beast (Crowley) rather than knight and queen (DuQuette).\s\sMost of the article is either humorous to hide what the OTO really represents or is pretty humorously inaccurate. Sensational is right. No sex actually takes place unless behind closed doors between consenting adults outside of temple/lodge settings and probably having nothing to do with magic (leave this one behind closed doors). The idea of being naked in ritual can be more than an idea yes but is representative of truth more than anything else.

The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica is a religious order and as such (and being non-mainstream) the term ""cult"" technically applies but the initiatory side is completely separate and the word ""cult"" would be inaccurate in describing them.\s\sEdit: also ""20 people in floor-length black robes with ceremonial daggers eating pork pies"" ... this is what freaked her out so badly?!

It was some crazy back and forth but I'm still a little bit embarrassed to be from the same country where a chunk of mainstream society still seems to think that baby snatching witch satan cults are real and want to burn Wiccans because somehow in England they haven't heard of them yet.Veganism tends to kill your libido so probably not the best place for a sex cult to meet regularly.They were all eating pork pies.Then why am I always horny?Got proof for that one buckaroo?How to prove you know nothing about veganism in just one sentence!Vegans mad AFLolSounds like the Gardnerians just finished circle...Someone somewhere in the internet: Vegan is devil backwards!!!!Daily failJust looks like some Goth edgelords lol they could have even been actors on lunch breakWhere are people finding these satanic sex cults I wanna join :(Did she join?

The kraken was released yesterday in Seattle. Just Google Seattle KrakenI read that as ‚Äúmythical Karen was real‚Äù like the ultimate Karen!Chuthulu Karen is realHeres my take.. In olden times we didnt have motors or propellers to make loud noises or create fast speeds. All we had were oval shaped boats with paddles sticking out the sides or.. just an oval shaped boat (to the eye of a squid or octopus).  So these animals are highly inquisitive and curious most likely they approached the ships touched all over them with their suckery sucker pads and tentacles.  Maybe it was checking to see if it was edible maybe it was checking to see what it was in general?   Maybe it wasnt even aggressive it just appeared aggressive because it was so unknown. A tentacle touching me would freak me out and a sucker pad full of hooks would probably get hung in your clothes and cause you to fall over board.  But these squid or octos dont do this anymore because the boats now have motors or are huge.

Putting a face and a name to the music would strip that away. Intentional or not the quest to learn the true identity of Mr. Fantastik is a direct reflection of why DOOM and his fanbase have such a strong connection: we always want to know more. DOOM is the master of always giving fans just enough to always look for answers. In a day and age when a guest 16 has a one-hour shelf life on social media DOOM has fans asking questions about a 2003 verse in 2019. Incredible.This is so true imagine we we had like 3 mediocre Mr. Fantastik albums/mixtapes those two verses would absolutely lose what makes them special. \s\sAlso most people just know the feature in ""Rap Snitch Knishes"" (Mm..FOOD) but I honestly think his feature in ""Anti Matter"" (Take me to your leader) is even better.Its probarbly just one of his friends that doesn't rap and he wrote the lyrics forHe first met him at an arms deal what else do you need to know?Dudes def New York.

Grottos have been popular features in gardens since at least the time of the Greek city-states so this site could‚Äôve been part of a wealthy person‚Äôs estate.I'm of the opinion that this is two separate things. The shell part? 1700's or most likely even 1830 right before it opened to the public. That part is ""new."" They say the shells are discolored from gas lamps. Well how would they have lit the area before then? Would fire lighting not cause some extent of damage? Therefore the shells are newish. The cavern system? Old. Old as balls. Don't know how old. The website doesn't want to go into the area's history likely owners church records geological records or whatever else there is. What about that ground penetrating radar that they use to find old wood or stone circles or lost archeological sites in the jungle? Use some of that on the area. Or they just know the actual answer because the ""mystery"" hype on their website feels a little suspect. WhO could It bE? The 12 year old kid found it sure uh huh ok. Respect to them for maintaining this place and it is a cool question though. I just think someone knows more than they are letting on and a proper survey could answer a lot of questions.They address that idea on the site.\s\s- The land the Grotto lies under was farmland and as far as we know has never formed part of a large estate. So why would a rich man‚Äôs fancy be built under someone else‚Äôs pastureland?\s‚Äã\s- Follies were built as a statement: look at how much money I have look at how cultured I am look at me! So if they included shells the more exotic the better. In general they weren‚Äôt secret hidden away places.\s‚Äã\s- If the Grotto had been built in the 1700s is it possible that all knowledge of it had disappeared by the time of its discovery in 1835? The building of the Grotto would have been a mammoth task: the excavation of the passageways transporting 4.6 million shells to the site sorting those shells and enlisting enough labour to create the mosaic. How to do all this on rising open ground next to a busy track without anyone noticing? lolHonestly the nature of the symbols and designs they described make it sound as if it could have been a pagan site to worship in secret if this place turns out to be much older than the 1700s.I wonder if it is an example of 'outsider art' & specifically a 'fantasy world' (also visionary environment)?  So a person who had access to the land & was driven by a naive but powerful artistic vision created the site for their own internal needs then passed away & it was forgotten until found later. I suspect it is not very old personally so maybe constructed within a 100 years of its later discovery.\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art\s\s(""In many cases their work is discovered only after their deaths."" from above link)\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visionary_environment\s\sCheck out https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval as an example of how this might be relevant.\s\sPeople who are interested in this sub may be interested in lots of material in those links.I used to go there when I was a kid!

The epic indicates where their planet originally was which is somewhere near the horse head nebula and within the orion nebula or possibly flame nebula.  The account indicates of a growing fierce giant that's red and crimson in coloring that has the blood of other planets on her hands.  Then she's defeated this is a super nova event which is why she has the blood of other planets and stars on her hands...This is not a mythical story this is the ancient past trying to communicate with us.  I believe it's  possible these cuneiform tablets are from the survivors themselves and this was their way to show us where they/we came from.  The answer is orions belt and this is why we see huge tributes around the world like egypt.  These are not tributes at all  they are sign visible from space like a flare for any other survivors. Hence the nazca lines messages to possible other survivors.

Two US harbour patrolmen Harold A. Dahl and Fred L. Crisman had spotted a UFO over the water of Puget Sound Washington. Dahl said that a man dressed in black visited him shortly after the sighting and forcefully advised him not to discuss the incident further. A similar meeting happened to Carlo Rossi from the area near San Pietro a Vico in Italy. In the early hours of 25th July 1952 Rossi was fishing in the River Serchio when he witnessed a strange circular craft hovering over the river. Rossi hid watching the craft as it passed over him and then sped away. In the following weeks he told no-one about what he had seen but on 15th September he found a stranger dressed in a dark blue suit waiting for him by the river. The stranger spoke Italian but with an odd Scandinavian accent and had very strange facial features.Smith's men in black and Kevin Spacey but the 1st 2 are actually ironically funny.\s\s.bruh this shit is retardedIf you say so ""Geoffery"" üòÇHaha this is brilliant better than most modern day comedy‚Äôs I love it thanksBut we know the people who made the crop circles with ropes and planks.Fake afStop spamming it in every sub possible.

One of the most fascinating ideas brought forward from ancient times is the concept of a hidden world existing underneath the surface of the Earth. Agartha (also referred to as Agharti Agartta or Agarttha) is arguably the most popular version of this type of legend being mentioned in one form or another by several different ancient societies throughout history.  There are a plethora of oral traditions and popular legends found throughout several countries detailing the existence of an underground civilization of beings who possess supernatural intelligence and significant spiritual power. These subterranean people are commonly believed to be the inhabitants of Agartha.

She basically said they exist they‚Äôve helped our tech our presidents have known and they aren‚Äôt ever going to harm us. In all her cases she never discovered a negative experience where someone who encountered aliens or were abducted. She said the human minds strongest emotion is fear so when she worked with her clients she would put them in a trance that put their state of conscious out of the picture so we could get past the fear or that blocks the process. Cool stuff!Dont buy sex with aliens or hybrid etc... abduction victims have similar stories yes but I would guess this is more of an MK ultra type situation ..prepping/ creating a false alien invasion narrative Among the many harrowing tales of alien abduction there are scores of cases where abductees have reported interacting with alien hybrids. According to the various testimonies of these victims they have personally encountered creatures that shared both human and alien features and characteristics.Any time I see an abduction victim talking about having sex with aliens I know they are lying through their teeth. Aliens and humans would not be sexually attracted to each other it would be like wanting to have sex with a squid or something.

Care to summarize ? In 1924 archaeologists found the remains of red-haired giants the Si-Te-Cah of Piaute folklore in Lovelock Cave Nevada. Is this fact fiction or legend?  Lovelock Cave in Nevada was first discovered in 1913 when prospectors found a huge deposit of bat guano in this cave. Since guano is the basis for saltpeter the main ingredient in gunpowder the value of the find was obvious.‚ÄúAccording to Paiute oral history the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants. Mummified remains of a man ""six feet six inches tall"" were discovered by guano miners in Lovelock Cave in 1911.[4]:168 Adrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book Fossil Legends of the First Americans.[12] She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However about 100 miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature soil etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red.‚Äù"

The Pentagon seems to have had carte blanche exclusive access to all UAP information at least in the U.S. - and now that others that have equipment that can possibly detect and reveal more than the Pentagon wants to reveal and are showing interesting in studying the phenomena they need to take measures to keep the lid on their secrets.\s\sPerhaps because they still think this should be information only the military should have access to... or perhaps their lies of decades gone by will be exposed.

What is so top secret about a desolate planet?Part of it is because bandwidth between Earth and Mars isn't very good and often reserved for other often critical mission objectives. Another part is how much power the rover and drone can expend before having to recharge it's reserved mostly for the missions as well and life support.It is millions of miles to Mars.

Let‚Äôs just discount the years of disclosure from people with government credentials that tells us these programs have been going on since WW2. We‚Äôll never get the truth from our government because it isn‚Äôt ours anymore. They‚Äôve proved that over and over that they don‚Äôt answer to us the people.This is a different world. That report has just said this UFO stuff is real.\s\sThe USG is attempting to ascertain intent but can't. The USG admits something is occurring in our national security space in a way where pilots and people looking can't figure out what it is they are looking at and therefore cannot ascertain what it wants.\s\sPerhaps we should go back to calling them UFO? Given that it seems most of the P in Phenomenon are O as in Objects. But I digress the USG admits and acknowledges these are real-world phenomena.\s\sThis is now a conversation of is this us as in of human construction on this planet or not? Is it a foreign adversary that has developed technology so radical and leapfrog us in such a way that we have no idea the intent of that device? I find it humorous that the best idea the Russians or Chinese can come up with to use this technology is to buzz our fighters. Come on... Think more along the lines of first strike via uninhibited placement of tactical nuclear weapons via a single Tic-Tac?\s\sThis report is saying:\s\s1. These are real.\s2. We don't know what they are.\s3. If this is a foreign adversary we've been technologically triple-leapfrogged.\s4. Clearly this could pose a threat to national security. But is this true if it is a foreign actor but not of this planet? This document says we don't know and need more data.\s\sThe report specifically addresses the stigmatization of reporting UAP sightings in the military. Moreover it states that socio-cultural stigmas are real and debilitating. Professionals REALLY don't want to be laughed at or ridiculed or potentially lose their job.\s\sThis report is saying that we need real data and describes a ""giggle-factor"" that is hampering the ability to get that information. I'm looking directly at you NDT. Sam Harris literally tried to warn you.\s\sThe scientific community has been absent on this issue. They have betrayed not this country but you could say on some level this planet. Science as an institution has utterly failed on this issue. The point the report is making is this is hampering the ability to do real science because scientists are behaving in this dogmatic way and not actually doing the observation.\s\sDespite the resentment towards science it's worth making a point that you are still needed to help bring the public to awareness. You can't have a document like this and the world go on as normal. We need more information.\s\sDisclaimer and warning: This is currently being heavily framed in terms of national security. It would be appreciated if the scientists could get their heads out of their asses and start providing their take on this evolving situation. Start doing their own experimentation and petitioning the USG for what it knows.More like wont be explainedthis photo if real makes me wonder if it's American tech. it looks like a test device like everything you need to make it fly but it just doesn't have the polished outer finish.Hard to tell from one pic.Let's just desensationalise this a bit shall we.\s\s**SOME** of these ""UFO"" incidences remain unexplained.\s\sWhich in of itself is amazing but don't phrase it like every graining picture of a frisbee is now somehow legitimized.If you want to desensationalise it further Blue Book stated some of its cases were unidentified too and that was 70 years ago.

Extremely credible witnesses especially the pilot.  I want to know more about the thrusters he observed what they looked like etc.  first time I‚Äôve heard of craft operating in that way.

Example video from 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6QL0VjqYgI&t=0sHmmmIf anyone is interested in my UFO sighting I posted it here. It was before drones were readily available to the public it definitely wasn‚Äôt a Chinese Lantern it occurred during a snowstorm and I have confirmation it wasn‚Äôt a civilian aircraft - my dad was a helicopter pilot at the time and he told me the nearest base/airport  was closed due to the intense snowstorm.\s\sI saw a blinking orange/red dot in the sky that was sort of bobbing up and down. It was blinking because the snow would disrupt the light so as it got closer it wasn‚Äôt blinking but definitely had some variation. It looks like a big ball of fire.\s\sIt was a sphere of energy/plasma and I estimate it was anywhere from 6-10 ft in diameter. When I stopped my vehicle to look at it it also stopped and hovered above the trees seeming to acknowledge me (but who knows). \s\sAnyway so I wrote this report 11/24/2010 it was before cellphones had cameras that were any good. \s\shttp://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79047.html\s\sUpon researching my area I also noticed others has similar sightings to mine.Tictac is your Apple design influence on uap perception.iTacNah would have a dongle hanging off of itUfos have been described as wheels shields chariots pillars etc and it's literally just a contextual description based on what the observers knew as similarities/references of the time. To speculate that there's technology that alters a person's perception is quite a leap especially once you take into consideration multiple/mass ufo sightings where individuals all report to see the same thing. If the technology/method that's described in this video exists surely people would have conflicting descriptions/accounts when it came to ufo observations/experiences?  \s\s\sWhen have you ever heard a credible ufo report where person A said a UFO was round and person B claimed it to be square? Plus how does a seamless tictac with two rod/antenna protruding from it; which bounces around ""like a pingpong ball"" help anyone's brain understand what they're seeing? Also why? Why have a technology that does this? And why have a technology that appears to evolve alongside man's technological evolution? I can understand a wheel a shield and a chariot...why does it then become more complex so complex I'm no longer able to understand what I'm observing?I responded below as well but I think your questions can actually be answered pretty well through quantum physics. At the most basic level - quantum physics would allow for something to be 'really present' in two places at once/ non-binary - potentially something we would perceive as 'a pingpong ball' motion; because our brains biologically create our reality in a binary way (ie. each neuron is either receiving/ transmitting electrical signal(s) or not 1 or 0) we may not be able to effectively process what we are seeing if the info is both 1 and 0 or 0 and 0 or 1 and 1 at the same time.I do think incidents like the Ariel School where the children mostly reported perceiving the same rough shape but had different reported perceptions about the aliens looks/ actions of aliens/ sizes of aliens/ hair...etc. is an example of the way many people could experience 'the same' thing and have disparate memories.I mean anything's possible? \s\shttps://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a36329671/is-the-universe-conscious/\s\shttps://newatlas.com/physics/charm-meson-particle-matter-antimatter/I agree. This line of reasoning is so damn lazy. In fact it so encapsulates conspiratorial thinking that whoever puts forth this theory should be embarrassed. It's a classic example of connecting any and every dot whether it makes sense to or not.\s\s""Hmm strange phenomenon happening here. I know! It's all connected it's all the same thing! You see?! Don't you!? We are all one and we create our own reality through the sheer fact that we are conscious beings!""\s\sAny theory that has ""we create our own reality"" at its core is total buffoonery.Yo a thought just occurred to me what if there aren‚Äôt any reports of sound because sound is somehow too messy to project? \s\sBut this kinda falls apart since it can‚Äôt be proven but here it is anyways \s\sWhat if these things are able to induce false signals in networks of any kind? Create a visual illusion or an illusion in sensor system that results on everyone agreeing to see the same phenomenon. That works just fine for things that we see. The problem with sound is that it can‚Äôt be reduced to some change in a network it‚Äôs literally the uniform vibration of trillions upon trillions of particles in 3D space. But we can accomplish that vibration by the use of any object. The problem with this projection thing is that it isn‚Äôt there and thus can‚Äôt have that complex effect on reality. \s\sIt can make any network feel see or hear something that isn‚Äôt there. But can‚Äôt affect matter even in the most rudimentary way. \s\sAnd this is assuming that the complexity of the network doesn‚Äôt matter. A 20 million dollar FLIR system is treated the same as an analog thermometer \s\sThis probably applies to light too equally untestable but it probably doesn‚Äôt emit IR light to physically heat anything either. Or any sort of real interaction with any set of particles. \s\sMaybe we can trick it. Shove an ungodly amount of sensors at it to prove that there physically isn‚Äôt anything there by somehow overloading it.\s\sBut this is most definitely just a ham fisted way to explain away the weird lack of sound from case to case. Maybe the lack of sound just sounds futuristicThere's a book by Patrick F. Galouye called The Dark Universe. I don't want to give away too much because it's actually a very cool book and I recommend it to anyone.. but the gist of it is there is a group of isolated people living underground who have not seen light in a generation or two.\s\sThey have lived in perfect darkness. One group developed pretty sophisticated echo location and another some sort of infrared. The people with sonar see light for the first time and just cannot wrap their heads around it. ""Silent sound"" they call it.  \s\s\sI'm open to the idea that what we consider the physical world is actually psycho-physical.\s\sWe could be a tribe of people who have developed this sort of physicalism as our way of deciphering reality.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø\s\sDon't knowOh man.. Or what if this is the prison reality but now they need people who can expertly navigate 'this' band of the electromagnetic spectrum bc troubles in the wider spectrum. Starring Vin diesel.Thank you. I had read that book as a teenager and had totally forgotten about it.This video postulates that there is a mass hallucination taking place. This makes no sense. This means that something is causing the navy sensors to somehow be affected. I guess if whatever is causing the mass hallucination it is powerful enough to make our minds hallucinate but also the navy sensors? I find that hard to believe and to me that makes it much more believable that it is actual aliens that people are seeing.I think the phenomenona materializes into this dimension which is why it gets picked up by radar sometimeswe would see tits food and money if it's mass hallucinationCheck out my response above. I think a mass hallucination implies a sense of delusion but is actually closely linked to the biology of our brain. While it's not a perfect answer and I take your point regarding the navy sensors the sensors themselves are built outside of/ below quantum perceptions and the sensor data has to be interpreted in a way that our mind can perceive what is happening. The example within the TED talk when he shows how google AI creates an interpretation is related - watch from about 7:00-8:30.[deleted][deleted]When I was younger I had this thought that consciousness lives on after death but separated from all life and anyone else in eternal darkness.So what does fit the mind of a camera?good watchThis channel is a gold mine. She also links the source documents in the description.\s\sShe‚Äôs working on a documentary so they are on a hiatus but it will be well worth it.What if we live in a simulation and all ufos/paranormal occurrences are just outside equivalent of 4chan trolling us?Source Documents: https://itsredacted.com/the-most-unsettling-u-f-o-theory/This seems like such a bullshit theory.  \s\sWe have infrared alert systems that respond to these things?\s\sAre they influencing our minds and then being sure to also go in and edit magnetic thermal and satellite imagery captured by devices potentially hundreds of miles away in real time?It's easy to rule what's suggested in this episode out when you are looking for ""serious proof"". By cherry-picking your data you throw out all the cases where someone saw bigfoot near to a UFO independent sightings of weird creatures (as in ""not my bailiwick im after aliens & tech"") etc. When you see the larger context it becomes clear that there is a connection between most of these strange types of encounters. You are free to still conclude they are all imaginary but with more vigor. Or you conclude the other way too that a lot of this stuff is eerily related.\s\sIf you found this video interesting do not pass go: read Passport to Magonia. Even if you disagree with it Vall√©e presents much more detail to this theory which is very damn interesting. If you have seen and read hundreds of UFO witness cases you can immediately see that there is something to this once you see what Vall√©e is talking about here. \s\sAlso note that the 2nd half of this book is all UFO reports in chronological order starting with north american air ship sightings around 1897.‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt tic tacs‚ÄùTLDR?Man.\s\sI won‚Äôt do it justice but I‚Äôll try.\s\sThis phenomenona plays off our consciousness and what we as a collective expect a ufo to look like or something like that. \s\sThroughout the years this phenomenona has changed shape the video goes through how in the past people saw cones and fighters with shields. \s\sThen we saw saucers and now tic tacs. Basically our mind is trying to make sense of what we are seeing so we basically see what we want to. It derives off of Jacques Vallee theory. Here‚Äôs a link to his [ama](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3url1s/i_am_dr_jacques_vall%C3%A9e_a_computer_scientist_and/)Nah.

People would rather believe whatever their tv says and believe in aLiEnS.They're fallen angels abducting people so they can use us for reproduction. That's the most unsettling conclusion for me.\s\sI hope I'm wrong. Been studying UFOs for almost 27 years since I saw one hovering over a house. It would explain everything.\s\s- Why they don't communicate\s- Why they hide\s- Why our laws of physics don't apply to them\s- Why human looking people reported aboard UFOs\s- Why they talk about God\s- Why abductions happen\s- Why their technology is so far ahead\s\sGenesis 6 describes it happening before.That we‚Äôre a harvest and them watching us is basically tending the stock..tldw; a few weeks ago Tim McMillan told Steven Greenstreet something that was pretty significant: an intelligence/aerospace source alluded to UFOs not being flying saucers or tic tacs but ‚Äúsomething that possessed the ability to make your mind see what makes sense to you.‚Äù\s\sIn isolation this is just one comment.

Maybe he had them on his page because they were choosing which ones would be visible on the show.So uh the possibility that 1) their technology also changes over time or 2) they may have multiple types of craft or 3) there may simply be different ETs visiting us at different times... has never occurred to these folks?That too. As well as our minds not being able to make sense of what it is so we are projecting.So what Are they imitating Apple AirPods now?Anyone interested in considering what this may represent should look up Donald Hoffman on Youtube. As our interface evolves so our icons for whatever these craft actually represent in objective reality (the realm of conscious agents) does too.Vallee also says it is a technology. Hence the materials he has been parading around for years.This is a bad theory because its basically unfalsifiable. Every observation you make of any object conforms to the theory.\s\sYou see a stick falling? Its a UFO making itself look like a stick.\s\sYou see an airplane? Its a UFO making itself look like an airplane.\s\sYou see a saucer? Its a UFO making itself look like a saucer.\s\sHow do we distinguish between an entity that takes a form based on our psychology and a set of distinctly shaped entities? You cant.\s\sA theory that automatically conforms to every observation is a sign of poor Epistemology. \s\sFurthermore the fact that UFO shapes change over time to reflect the designs and fashions of the time is evidence that pareidolia is the primary cause of most of these sightings. \s\sFlying saucers from the 1950s have a distinctive 1950s look. This is evidence for the null hypothesis not evidence for the reality of UFOsIt really does come across as a hand-waving explain for why they don't have any substantial evidence of E.T.s or to brush over the clearly contradictory positions of ""experts"" when they want to believe both. \s\sIt's borderline of ""well if there was a successful conspiracy to keep it all secret then there would be absolutely no evidence of a conspiracy. There is no evidence of a conspiracy so conspiracy confirmed!""The very first flying saucer report that kicked off the trend was a misunderstanding! The actual craft were described as flying wings their movement was described as that of skipping saucers. This got reported as flying saucers and suddenly thats what everyone is seeing.It's not a theory to prove ufo's are real but rather explain what may be going on. I'm pretty sure the TTSA are all in on them already proven.\s\sAs a theory is it testable? Yes but with time and collecting samples. Does this mean it is testable?Or maybe like humans do with automobiles aliens are constantly changing their ship designs due to years of engineering.If anyone has read the book ‚ÄòSupernatural‚Äô by Graham Hancock they‚Äôd see the same ideas that are presented here.\s\sIn that book he posits that the phenomena of Shamanic initiations with chimeric gods seen in cave paintings accounts of fairies & elves alien abductions angelic apparitions and DMT/Ayahuasca entities are all accounts of the same phenomena of contact with inter-dimensional intelligence.\s\sThe book is wild. Even wilder than the rest of his body of work. I really struggled with it when I read it but I have to admit that it‚Äôs only seeming more prescient as whatever we are collectively going through right now continues to unfold.I cant roll my eyes any harder\s\snot against that channel btw.  I actually really like it.  but man some of this stuff is just woowoo.I actually see this as the exact opposite of woooo. If you read Jacques Vallee you‚Äôll start to see what I mean. He‚Äôs as serious a scientist and intelligent as they come imo. It‚Äôs about perception and subjectivity. When primitive tribes saw airplanes for the first time they thought they were birds. When you see something unexplainable and outside of your scope of experience your mind tries to identify it as best it can based on your subjectivity level. It makes sense that this could be happening to people who are looking at something that our minds can‚Äôt make sense of. It‚Äôs a pretty simple concept.Ur wowThe AATIP slides about psychological effects aren't necessarily about the morphing theory. They could just as well be about telepathy and people sometimes feeling overwhelming urges relating to UFOs. In many cases eyewitnesses describe getting telepathic messages from the UFO and being able to control it by simply wishing it would do something. This ability is a key point relating to national security.\s\sThe senior intelligence official's comments about a craft with an occupant crashing at Roswell are at odds with him also saying the phenomenon changes to reflect our ideas and concepts. Is the crashed craft they have at a warehouse somewhere constantly shape-shifting over time? The whole morphing theory is based on the objects NOT being real metallic saucers from other planets but some sort of mental projection based on a physical trigger. Which is the opposite of what the Roswell crash supposedly was a real reverse-engineerable metallic saucer with a biological pilot inside. You can't really claim both at once.They‚Äôre metaphysical manifestations of demonic entrances into the Geist obviously.We jest but that's the sort of thing the TTSA guys keep vaguely pointing towards as being their overall theory of UAP.  They seem to be trying to reconcile Ufology with the Skinwalker shit.  It's dumb and really unfortunate they've created a nice little monopoly for themselves on the whole UFO narrative./s\s\sStay erect and out of serious discussions.[deleted]I think we are often so focus on the observation and trying to find an explanation for these things that we actually don't pay attention to the psychology of the observer. At best we label the observer as credible or   a conman but we never really ask: how has a persons unconscious participated in a specific observation or claim. How did it try to make sense of  an indescribable phenomenon.\s\sI think there is definately a link that makes that the same phenomenon can appear in different ways and invoke totally different experiences ranging from fearful to almost blissful.\s\sIn one of his last books Carl C Jung looked at the ufo phenomenon and he theorized that in a world thats now ever more fragmented the circular aspect of a flying saucer was a symbolic shape signifying mans subconscious longing for wholeness amidst the tensions brought on by a world-disrupting cold war and the nuclear threat.\s\sSince the 50 ies we see less and less saucers but more and more triangular or TicTac shaped objects. The ufo symbolism changes with time it seemsHey here's a thought; what if it was both things? What if there are transdimensional and extraterrestrial intelligences visiting Earth at the same time? And...what if they both knew they were here?\s\sI'm playing devil's advocate here a bit. I'm certainly a proponant of Jacques Vall√©e's theories (which is a somewhat unifying theory of UAPs) but it might not be the only explanation.Some of us have known about this technology for years. It‚Äôs called a chameleon circuit. These crafts typically use them to hide in plain sight but the circuits are known to be a bit unreliable.It is odd how often you see a blue police box around london and cardiff these days.*The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man has entered the chatroom.Then why did we see white ball UFOs in 1952? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsHlFeC5vic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsHlFeC5vic)  \s\sModern times (just one example of many): \s\s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfjz7PknBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfjz7PknBQ)This has to be the most ridiculous thing I have heard.\s\sWe canr explain.why everyone's ufos are.different so let's just explain it by saying the morph. LolIt truly is retarded and over complicating things. Simply because it's more entertaining.Cool story bro.\s\sNo but for reals I would have to disagree. \s\sI've had several sightings alone as well as with groups of friends of various sizes.\s\sIf this theory held any water then my friends and I would have all seen our own personal versions of these things rather than the same lights shapes hues and movements.\s\sFor example: my friend his girlfriend and I all would have seen something different but my phone has no imagination. It is merely a light sensor picking up light so in [this video](https://youtu.be/KxF5SOUcnnA) who's ""imagined version"" of a UFO are we seeing? Mine? My friends? Or my phones?Maybe. But lights shapes and hues are open to interpretation. We can‚Äôt know that the red I see is the same as the red you see. But if you had seen a large object up close with a group of friends and you could all draw it in detail it might look very differently based on your level subjectivity (past experience life experience etc.) 4 friends and I saw something up close back in 97 and although I am completely certain that I saw 5 huge black triangle ships with lights on the corners etc when I talked to all of them recently each one of them remember seeing something mind blowing and other worldly but their description was no where near mine not even in the same ballpark. Besides that we all experienced the same thing at the same time but what it looked like to each of us was very different. If it had been a point of light or something without exact details it would be hard to know if what we saw was similar. But in this case what I saw was very detailed. And my friends apparently saw different details. This theory is one explanation of why we all saw different things. So it makes sense to me as a possibility. Either way cool stuff.So the observer predicts the outcome just like in the slit experiment? An effect of quantum physics?Do they change or does our perception of them change?Oh shit they're time lords?What if they were just bots sent out by the simulation. Like Smith Agents in the matrixNaah thats not itOnce again we're going with what's more entertaining to our imaginations and over complicating things.Posted on another sub with this vid but:\s\sI would be careful about Valle for a couple reasons:\s\s1. We know of sightings historically that are similar to sightings today. IE Neuremberg Aerial Phenomenon ~1560AD\s\s2. The fundamental principle behind his theory is intense paranoia and the belief that UFO's aren't real\s3. He worked for the CIA while developing these theories\s\s4. Inconsistent beliefs surrounding remote viewing sometimes treated as pure deception sometimes extremely active and supportive of the community\s\s5. Unlike virtually every ET researcher there is not a single critique of him from the scientific community that I can find. Screams ""hey trust this guy!"" \s\s6. It seems relatively obvious that world governments have been working to cover up UFO information for decades. Mirage Men Unacknowledged Black Programs redacted or incomplete FOIA requests (ie bluebook NASA sections) etc\s\s7. The ""government"" information here is not coming from a verifiable source and could easily be fake or pure disinformationYou should read some of his books because all of those points you made make you look silly and like someone who doesn‚Äôt know squat about Vallee.This would immediately destroy all\sstories of crashes retrieved parts (at least bigger ones) captured beings and reverse engineering. It would also make some hallucination inducing atmospheric/environmental effect much more likely than anything else. It is way more probable that the whole thing is experienced as real but that this experience is entirely made up in our minds. Then you have two possibilities - some sort of control mechanism as suggested in the video or a reoccurring psychological effect. Well I go with a malfunction of the human brain in this case.And dr. Davis saying we have recovered off world vehicles?I guess the question is to what degree are they able to manipulate physical matter? It seems that existing outside of time is a possibility which could limit the effect they have over this dimension. But if they can manipulate matter at the molecular level a la nanotech then purported crashes could certaily still be a thing. Bottom line is that this theory creates a cascading set of additional questions. The but the question of *how* they manipulate our 'reality'  is the key one for me. Is it physical is it psychological is it temporal?Lol wutI'm confused what does this have to do with UFOs?Meh. It's probably more relevant to paranormal subreddits. It's loosely relevant to UFOs and part of the article seems to be trying to rule out the UFO hypothesis. From the article:\s\s>In 1990 the prosecutor Ivanov who had retired published an article in which he claimed that while compiling his 1959 report he‚Äôd been pressured not to include his views on what happened. The article titled ‚ÄúThe Enigma of the Fireballs‚Äù said that the skiers had been killed by heat rays or balls of fire associated with U.F.O.s. In his original examination of the scene Ivanov had found trees with unusual burn marks which ‚Äúconfirmed that some kind of heat ray say or a powerful force whose nature is completely unknown (to us at least) acted selectively on specific objects‚Äù‚Äîin this case people. The last photograph in Krivonishchenko‚Äôs camera showed flares and streaks of light against a black background.Hi confused I'm Dad! :)Sightings involving ufos that night in this area and potential radioactivity on the site.Hi confused nice to meet you I am also dad.\s\sActually some us ""researchers"" theorized that there might have been UFOs involved as some people of the local Mansi tribe saw ""strange lights"" in the area around the time the incident happened.Text as it's behind a paywall for some:\s\s>The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has probably written close to 2000 columns since coming to The Washington Post. Among those that generated a steady stream of responses was one from 2019 headlined ‚ÄúUFOs exist and everyone needs to adjust to that fact.‚Äù That column did not say that aliens have visited Earth. Among the things it did say was that there literally are objects flying around that no one including U.S. Navy pilots can identify and we have to puzzle out what that means.\s\s>In the two years since that column appeared the U.S. government continues to tiptoe toward the normalization of the idea of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Last year the Department of Defense released three videos (one recorded in 2004 and the other two in 2015) of U.S. Navy pilots seeing something and having no idea what it was. In its news release the Pentagon said ‚Äúthe aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as ‚Äòunidentified‚Äô‚Äù putting the U in UFO.\s\s>The Pentagon went further in August 2020 announcing the establishment of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force. Beyond developing a new abbreviation that is less loaded than UFO the Pentagon explained ‚ÄúThe mission of the task force is to detect analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.‚Äù\s\s>Then 10 days ago former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe went on Fox News and made a whole bunch of claims about what the U.S. intelligence community knew about UAPs including that a Pentagon report would soon be released revealing even more information. According to the New York Post‚Äôs Tamar Lapin and Jackie Salo:\s\s>    ‚ÄúThere are a lot more sightings than have been made public‚Äù he told host Maria Bartiromo. ‚ÄúSome of those have been declassified.‚Äù\s\s>    ‚ÄúAnd when we talk about sightings‚Äù Ratcliffe continued ‚Äúwe are talking about objects that have been seen by Navy or Air Force pilots or have been picked up by satellite imagery that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain.‚Äù\s\s>    ‚ÄúMovements that are hard to replicate that we don‚Äôt have the technology for. Or traveling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom.‚Äù\s\s>Still it would appear that in June there will be an official U.S. government report acknowledging the existence of UFOs or UAPs or whatever you want to call them.\s\s>It is increasingly respectable to acknowledge that unidentified aerial phenomena are a thing. But this leads to a few follow-up questions. Does this evidence point toward the prospect of extraterrestrial observation of our planet? If so how should we feel about that?\s\s>I am not going to speculate on the first question beyond noting that if Harvard astrophysicists are making that suggestion about interstellar phenomena perhaps we need at least to consider the possibility that these UAPs might also be extraterrestrial in origin.\s\s>The more interesting question is how we should respond to this. There has been increasing apprehension on the part of some very smart people about contacting extraterrestrials. In 2010 Stephen Hawking told the Discovery Channel ‚ÄúIf aliens visit us the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America which didn‚Äôt turn out well for the Native Americans.‚Äù Similarly physicist Mark Buchanan argued in 2016 ‚ÄúAny civilization detecting our presence is likely to be technologically very advanced and may not be disposed to treat us nicely. At the very least the idea seems morally questionable.‚Äù\s\s>If UAPs are extraterrestrials however this is a different scenario: It is not humans contacting extraterrestrials but rather those extraterrestrials actively observing us. Furthermore they seem to be doing so in a way that is not destructive.\s\s>That is promising! Observation without the intent to destroy suggests a civilization that is much less violent than say Spanish conquistadors.\s\s>Furthermore it might be better for U.S. national security if these UAPs turn out to be ETs. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told the New York Post ‚ÄúFrankly that if it‚Äôs something from outside this planet ‚Äî that might actually be better than the fact that we‚Äôve seen some technological leap on behalf of the Chinese or the Russians or some other adversary that allows them to conduct this activity.‚Äù\s\s>I get the concern from physicists that technologically advanced extraterrestrials might behave as powerful human civilizations have in the past. But maybe the concerned physicists should engage a little more with social scientists. The assumption is that powerful technologically advanced civilizations will act in a destructive manner. That is possible but perhaps civilizations that reward destructive entrepreneurship are less likely to generate the technological wherewithal for interstellar travel. And if those UAPs are ETs maybe there is more hope for interstellar relations than either scientists or science fiction envision.\s\sEdit: Thanks for the gold kind human.\s\sEdit numero dos: Thanks for the *To The Stars* award fellow redditor.

But it‚Äôs so much more than ‚Äòthese might be ET!‚Äô \s\sThose  who still claim we lack evidence for ET are simply unwilling to ‚Äòeven entertain‚Äô evidence that doesn‚Äôt come from mainstream sources. You don‚Äôt have to believe it to read it. But those who dive in with a scientific mindset most often become believers and advocates for our ET companions.Thanks!\s\sI never understood how anyone could state that the most likely explanation for UAP are either secret US Chinese or Russian military projects. The observed and documented flight characteristics far surpass our most advanced planes (rockets fly fast but they can't hover obviously). These objects have been observed for a long time too.\s\sSo to me it is incomprehensible to assume that the ET hypothesis is STILL the must unlikely. Given what is known it is the MOST likely.Do you think its scientific to extrapolate our barbaric behavior onto beings we've never met? That's not exactly giving our creators a fair shakeWow.

We've already made life hard for large whales.Its as if we're not supposed to go poking around down thereAliens are far less scary than whatever might lurk in the shadows deep in the ocean.I seem to remember a situation where someone found a beacon checked it out and killed the entire population of an atmospheric processing colony along with most of an expeditionary detachment. Building better worlds my ass.What?Don't they blur out all unusual structures on the moon massive ones?Yes NASA denied but they had a dept. comprised of a few people to wash out 5So tired of the ""we doubt it's aliens""to me it's intellectual narcissism on the part of many scientists.Yet ignoring the things in our own sky.I will never trust NASA unless they show us the stuff that Gary McKinnon found on their servers.I‚Äôm out of the loop on this one. What‚Äôs the story?>Gary McKinnon\s\sInteresting.Here for the loop>These are things like radio signals or even megastructures; that is artificial objects on a gigantic scale such as hypothesized star-sized supercomputers. \s\sWhy not just call it a *Death Star*?I think we need them to put geostationary satellites pointed at the oceans.Stupid. Why not just contact the intelligence that is here and ask.Why the fuck does it have to be quiet? Let us know your searching for shit we have no idea what to expect. It‚Äôll be interesting if anything comes out of this.It's not quiet they have been doing this for years. The title is just clickbait.They're in Antarctica........your welcomeWaste of moneyTabby's Star may also have a Dyson sphere according to it's strange light changing behaviorThe thing with Dyson spheres / Ringworlds etc is if in theory possible where would the raw materials to actually build them come from?One theory is that they are built like a puzzle from multiple spaceships/satelites.  Much like the ISS which was enlarged and upgraded over time.I'm sure it took a really long time but probably from nearby planets. Mine and then fabricate and then transport.You know if you assume controlled full-knowledge disclosure (and the even more extreme alien-planned disclosure) and the eth then everything any part of the government does might be assumed to be in preparation for disclosure and public alien contact. So for example a 'hunt for alien megastructures' might mean 'searching' and 'finding' an alien megastructure then another and another (amazing!) to ease the public into the idea of alien life and alien civilizations. Then lo and behold aliens are visiting us; crazy! Though the government was aware of all of this the whole time\s\sA doubtful idea but conceivably possibleWhat a waste of money and should not be funded. It's all guess work and assumptions for what exactly? They should use that money to thoroughly investigate what we are seeing on this planet right now. SETI seems like a bunch of astronomers who simply like playing with radio telescopes but don't really want to think about how to really find intelligent life. I suspect advanced cultures have something better than radio to communicate with across distances. They should investigate the science behind faster than light communication using quantum mechanics. \s\sInstead fund a research team looking at UAPs and USOs. They appear to be intelligent already. Would put SETI out of a job as they only want to look outwards and playing astronomer so they don't really want to find ET intelligence it appears.

0,classified,UFObelievers,23,"What if the UAPTF reached out to NASA to request that the task force brief them on the classified aspects of UFOs?\s\sWhat if it included the Space Station manager and a NASA official who previously worked for Bigelow Aerospace?\s\sBecause that's EXACTLY what happened: https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/uap-task-force-initiated-contact-with-nasa-to-brief-them-on-ufos-but-they-wont-say-why\s\s(Edit: I can see my original post could be read two ways if someone didn't bother to read the article so I added a word to clarify)What impact does this have on everything?

I want to say these Germans in Sonora California working on their anti-grav airships said they could fly across the country.\s\sAs for the hypothesis yeah I agree with m3551xh.Carl Jung proposed the same theory about UFOsOr it could be demons. Pause. Ok so if I grew up Christian or some other religious back ground I would latch on to this explanation tightly. Or I if I just watched the matrix a bunch. Why is it so difficult to believe that an alien civilian has been visiting us?Because of social conditioning.I'm not Christian but I sincerely doubt they are demons but I also doubt they are from our plain of existence entirely. I'm a firm believer these beings or entities are interdimensional and are not from a physical place like Mars or Kappakappa 321382. I mean because.of the sizer of our blah blah blah I'm sure there are life forms out there probably even incredibly intelligent and advanced life forms but I think alot of people sadly and unfortunately just can't or refuse to grasp just how much Earth and the milky way in general is literally in the middle of no where. I'm not saying you don't understand or know just how lost and hidden we are in the universe but yeah. Since I came to believe these Craft's and beings and interdimensional I can totally see the demon correlation now. Which I never been able to do and I use to scoff at people who did make that correlation.  Because what I find creepy any maybe you will too is that once we die we will be on the same plain of exsistenc as these beings.Imagine playing a computer game. A game you played hundreds of times. When suddenly a ufo appears in your game. It wasnt meant to be there. Still it is there. And it disappears.\sConclusion? They are an anomaly in your game.\sIf our reality has a digital layout made of data and why not because even DNA has data. Why not the universe?\sUFOs and aliens can be a 'virus' anomaly in our reality. Popping up whenever and wherever it wants.It's funny you said this I was actually pondering this today. Do you know if others have wrote on this idea and also maybe expand on what brought you to this conclusion?You should play Signal Simulator.I'Ve got a question here. Does he say ""TikToks"" or what word does he use? ""Tic Tocs""? And if so what does this mean? Because I am really confused about this word :([deleted]Ah the ending reminds me of something.\s\sThere were once heavy electric phenomena going on in our athmosphere you know like northern lights but probably nothing looking like the northern lights of today but the electricity in the athmosphere taking on weird shapes like forming figures that must have been like dancing humans with a vibrating circle around their hips.\s\sWatch the video of joe rogan with robert m. schoch about this. What I will type from now on on this post has nothing to do with the mentioned video but it delivered the basics for what I was thinking when I watched the UFO video from above.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSo as you can imagine this influenced mankind pretty heavy as seen in artwork and probably some oral traditions. Now WHAT IF these caused a genetical memory in mankind that now manifests in these UFO-thingies? Connected with the theory shown in this video is this to ""make us look up again"" and to ""inspire us""? Did these sightings in the sky these heavenly phenomenon that no human back then could understand finally parted us from the animal kingdom as we now looked to the sky and wondered about our past and future? Is it a collective experience manifesting in a way so we can all see them and even videotape them? Are these trhings supposed to spark our imagination to solve problems as a species and all? I mean I don't know how to explain it right now... is it something we cause ourselves always changing depending of our cultural background and with the purpose of reminding us that there's something bigger out there waiting for us as we should one day inherit space?\s\sARE WE projecting these things these events as a manifestation of our own thoughts desires worries needs do they remind us of staying strong and be more creative to solve the problems of our times? Is THIS the reason why there is an apparent increase of sightings?I think the data collected from abductee recollections is the most underrated information available in the ufo field today. These aren't manifestations. People from different times/places/languages all tell the same story with highly accurate detail. The answers lie within the story the abducted are telling.Or the evidence has been downplayed and covered up?Super interesting. I believe it was Terrence McKenna or Graham Hancock the JRE that first put me on to this thought. Everything we make will disintegrate or become completely unrecognizable in about 1000 years except for things made of stone.Even plastic?  \sAnd are you sure about that?  The ancient [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) has bronze in it and has been dated to about 70-60 BC.100%Great answerI believe there have been many different iterations of civilization since the beginning of time. There are countless Ooparts (out of place artifacts) that have been found that indicate so.We will never know if there‚Äôs no evidence. But it‚Äôs fun to think about.I mean did we really build them pyramids just a little over 2000 years?I don‚Äôt believe so. I‚Äôve heard some experts say they‚Äôre at least 12000 years old. Personally I don‚Äôt believe there is any way in hell they could cut and shape 1000+ ton blocks of granite with copper chisels. I feel like the proof lies in the precision.  There are polygonal megalithic stone structures all over the world that appear to be built by the same group of ‚Äúpeople‚ÄùIf old civilizations were advanced as we are why would they need to build pyramids out of stone?From the Earth yes.I've wondered this same question.  If other advanced civilizations have existed on Earth before us I'd think there would be some bit of evidence - We might find things like plastic old technology that hasn't fully degraded yet etc.  Even an old device such as the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) is recognizable as a human-made thing even though it has degraded a bit.  Also if an old advanced civilization got to the point of using fossil fuels perhaps we'd have less fossil fuels available to us than we currently do.What's your definition of advanced?Good questionOne argument speaking against that and it's ruining the whole theory for me is... Resources.\s\sAny civilization needs resources. Wood metal food lifestock.\s\sIf they were using all these resources well why is there still metal left for our civilization? Metal uranium rocks granite all the good stuff? Woods can regrow earth can be fertile again but once oil and metal is gone it's gone right?\s\sThough this isn't a concept we came up with just recently--- in Hinduism the major deity ""resets the universe"" every ... I believe I heard 1.4 billion years? Around like that but please go check it for yourself I am not 100% sure there and just heard about it very recently (1 week ago even) as a side note on another topic and haven't looked into it yet myself.As I've said elsewhere you're assuming that our civilisation is the model of perfection for an advanced society. Our way of doing things is not the only way and is arguably very inefficient. This also really depends on how long ago that civilisation existed. What if it existed during the Triassic or Jurassic?\s\sPeople tend to underestimate the vast span of history. Here is an example that I like to give. Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus are further apart in time from one another than we are from Tyrannosaurus Rex.Speaking of that...\s\sI found this site: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu98VWSRL2hrSlkvEo\_jrrw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu98VWSRL2hrSlkvEo_jrrw)\s\sAnd this video: [https://youtu.be/n85BwMBo-bE](https://youtu.be/n85BwMBo-bE)\s\sAnd this video: [https://youtu.be/Fs1JNG-K9Dc](https://youtu.be/Fs1JNG-K9Dc)\s\sThat asks some pointed questions about our human history (it seems from and engineering point of view).

And our DNA so that our off-spring will be less aggressive more thoughtful beyond our basic animalistic ways.  suffice it to say as in an old joke of mine *they make us and our children into liberal Democrats* ready to discard the old ways and embrace the new.  These children today are the disenfranchised frustrated ones that we see around us today that they themselves see no clear way forward.  \s\sSeveral factors are concurrently working to bring the world to its knees that will in turn led to a growing consciousness that we are all united and the world should be refashioned into a sane state of balanced ecological  sanity and equality for all living matter.  But old structures of mankind tangible and intangible must fail/change/disappear before we can be welcomed to the higher levels of intelligence that thrive in the cosmos.    \s\sAll done for a good reason but few citizens--not to mention governments would be willing to directly take on the transition.

0,classified,UF0,47,"Math is your answer. The have predictions about the way something is and then test that theory with math.\sThen a collection of peers reviews that math in an attempt to disprove it. If they cannot it's considered a new theory... Still not fact though. Theoretical ideas that were one believed to be set theory have later in history be proven very wrong and our whole idea of matter is changed... Like quantum theory.Too bad the math is wrong. I think we'll find out this decade that dark matter is incorrect and the reality that billions in wasted tax dollars have been lost on experiments to prove it is real will hit the science community hard. At this point they're in so deep I think they're scared of the truth it could hurt future funding.The real question. \s\sVice can be unnecessarily sensationalist on occasion but they hit the nail on the head with this piece.It is true. I have never liked VICE but they are oddly ok with being a platform for the UAP phenomenon.Imagine in the distant future mankind discovered this fifth dimension is where ""souls"" or living conscientiousness goes to rest after death The implications would be ridiculous. What happens to (most) religion? Which ones remain relevant? Which ones collapse? Or do they eventually rationalize this? And incorporate into their belief systems?Ask Neil deGrasse Tyson how he would do it with recent admissions about U.F.O.'s he is trying to walk back years of denial. That would be a good starting template.That's a huge misunderstanding of dark matter. u/teflonPrawn's statement on this thread is absolutely spot-on. One thing they didn't mention is that dark matter's posited existence is consistent with current scientific understanding of astrophysics because it is all founded on theories that have been proved accurate time and time again. All physics rest on some simple laws and it's where the dynamics of interacting forces are seen that things get more and more complex such that you eventually need huge supercomputers to ""do the math."" \s\sEssentially the very same laws that apply to understanding the dynamics of a ball thrown by a toddler are the same that govern all matter in the universe and since the ""laws of physics"" have been demonstrated to be accurate time and time again and are assumed to be the same in the entire observable universe so we find that something strange is afoot. When astrophysicists make detailed estimates of the amount of matter in galaxies they find that there simply isn't enough of it to keep the galaxies from flying apart. Therefore it is reasoned physicists predict that there must be a form of matter that is presently unobservable in any direct way by the means available to us EXCEPT for its gravitational interaction with ""baryonic"" matter. There are no positive claims being made as to what its nature actually is and our effort to understand dark matter could very well be the key to lock on the door to an entirely new understanding of physics. If not and they're totally wrong that's very exciting as well because we'd somehow have to reconcile observations with theory in a way unimaginable to most of us.[deleted]Or the previous physics is incomplete / wrong (i.e relativity and QM relativity and black holes).The moment world governments admit it is a real phenomenon it gives credible scientists the real go ahead to use grant money for research into alternate energy sources. Likely sources that can‚Äôt be sold. \s\sThe entire world economy runs literally on the petrol dollar. What if that rug was pulled out from us immediately? \s\sWhen something is made in China it‚Äôs not the labor that exponentially inflated costs by the time it gets to market or the manufacturing. It‚Äôs the shipping and getting it to where it needs to go by burning dinosaur bones. \s\sThink what you will about disclosure but an immediate announcement puts a finite and maybe even immediate (if we already have this tech-we do) death sentence to oil and the world economy. \s\sTook me over a decade to realize this. It‚Äôs the real reason for secrecy I believe.It would if some magic little box pop out of flying saucer we would be able to reproduce it on mass scale and give it away to everyone on earth equally. Now can you see that happens anytime soon? :) First hydrogen photovoltaic and windmills have to be played out and this change is now tokamaks and artificial suns are nextThere‚Äôs plenty of evidence for dark matter we just don‚Äôt have a physical quantity of it. Dark matter is detected by its affects on regular matter and we have observed these affects change in anticipated ways. The only aspect of UFOs that we can verify with this level of confidence is that sometimes there are lights in the sky that cannot be identified. All other details are often different from experience to experience. Even the commonly held belief of the greys is really more a mythology than an observation. Most of what we claim to know comes essentially from word of mouth.>There‚Äôs plenty of evidence for dark matter\s\sThis so much.    It's clear that either our understanding of physics is wrong or there's extra matter out there.  \s\sUFOs/UAPs probably are similar -- radar tapes probably exist that confirm something moving in our atmosphere in ways human technology could not replicate.  But Dark Energy can't start a panic -- proof of Aliens might.Dark matter is inferred by gravitational effects seen in cosmology. So it's a second order inference. But it's based on an assumption built from Michelson-Morley to disprove aether theory. Which ironically almost exactly the same interferometry experiment was used (with greater precision) to confirm the existence of gravity waves. There's a fundamental disconnect in the physics community here.Lol as a physics graduate this title really triggered me.No one says it doesnt exists sure but lets be completely honest here dark matter is temporal construct to explain away the matter distribution across the universe hence 'dark'. So that it would make 'sense' with our observations which in the end might turn out completely different. I love to watch science festivals when all these scientists - celebrities just sit and group talk about universe and stuff but it often reminds me conversations about ufos :). Complete speculation based on observations and deduction based on math but zero evidence nor lab testing methodology and they all agree that 'we just dont know' whats out there but these are the leading candidates. And they all know very well you cant drag everything on the lab table and dissect it yet you gotta work with it somehow and push the narrative forward.\s\s If we now move to ufology there is similar narrative. For instance there is such a commandor Fravor and Nimitz fuzzy grainy video who claims he saw incredible things and we just 'gotta believe him'. If we do what then? He clearly saw 'dark matter' on his own eyes it was there it flew away why someone who is willing to study and know the science behind that considered a kook in scientific community while guy talking about 'invisible' literally matter a ghost particles literally ghost surrounding each atom in proportion 12:1 or more being taken serious? This is a challenge not for us to tackle but we can all agree its absolutely fucking idtiotic prejudice.\s\sNow point is this - what benefit will give us that we will detect dark matter which they will announce as some derivative form of neutrino like they did with Higgs bozon which just conveniently appeared in certain GeV mass scale and what benefit would give us cracking the ufo technology? Wasn't that what science was all about? Lack of balls and prejudice is really hurting our progress these clever guys at Heidelberg in Max Planck institute could be studying now the crashed Roswell craft as we speak.\s\sIf the early 1900s scientist would also be such a prejudiced ball less cowards(but cant blame them) we would be probably writing these posts as telegrams :)Dark matter is fantasy material invented to balance mathematical equations.Because all this ‚Äúscience‚Äù around dark matter and strings is attempts to theoretically justify the continued maintenance of Newtonian/Cartesian dead world monotheistic World view. Ufology and less accepted science like quantum mechanics rely on things very similar to animism and panosychism which Europe has spent between 500 and 2000 years trying to destroy to center itself and enrich its elites.Mainstream science is corrupt and telling lies purposely or through peer reviewed ignorance.Because there IS evidence for Dark Matter. It's just not known what the cause of it is yet hence it's name. [https://www.uaptheory.com/](https://www.uaptheory.com/) \s\sJust read here that they are actually thinking of ditching the dark matter explanation for something more related to quantum gravity with the expanding universe having a more likely explanation based in entropy.  Sounds cool but I got a D in P-chem II so I will probably need someone to explain it to me.I think dark matter is the same concept as the 'ether' from the 19th century. \s\sSome day we'll understand the principles and there won't be the need for that construct anymore. \s\sAs for UFOs it's probably the same. It's a construct that we made since we don't know anything about the true nature of the phenomenon. \s\sScience doesn't accept that construct because of the ridicule that comes with it.Thank you OP. That is the heart of the issue. Career suicide ought to not even be a thing. Let‚Äôs change that rh and rn.Dark matter was ""selling"" but other than that who ever considred it serious ?\s\sit was a mean to an end.... need funding talk dark matter..\s\sneed paper published ? need audience = dark matter but i don't belive it has any real credibility...ever!Sorry.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/UF0) if you have any questions or concerns.*Over a decade and billions of dollars later not even so much as a bread crumb of evidence for dark matter. Almost comical in a wayr/titlegoreProbably because a lot of nutters and crazy people believe in UFOs being alien ships and while not everyone that believes in aliens and ufos are crazy the crazy ones just tend to get the most publicity dark matter in the other hand is on the cutting edge of theoretical physics and is respected due to the people that believe in it those being respected physicists. So really the legitimacy of a certain subject really depends on the people surrounding itThere is a whole field devoted to studying questions like this about science it‚Äôs called Science & Technology Studies (STS). The scholar Harry Collins has written about the sociology of the non-detection of Gravity Waves (and then their eventual detection) so I‚Äôd definitely recommend this as an instructive case study or analog. Other ‚Äúsciences without a subject‚Äù include astrobiology the hypothetical study of potential extraterrestrial life and what they do is study earth analogs like extremeophiles and the bigger question of the origin of life.Because the UFO topic if true would change everything about our existence.  All the world's religions the earth's history everything.\s\sDark matter is just another thing we don't understand and doesn't have immediately identifiable impact upon our place in the scheme of things.  Edit: meaning to the everyday person.I think that could be an simple answer. Our understanding of physics could be and probably is wrong. And how interesting that would be. Religion would be turned inside out and upside down for one huge reason. Science and religion go hand in hand.Haven‚Äôt seen any of these before. Second vid could possibly be Starlink but the rest look legit.I saw something like the third one when I was a kid with my brother and my cousins. I remember the way it moved going up slowly but going down fast in a zigzag patternEXPLOSION!!!2 short sightings in Spain and India and the rest of the video is flooded with USA and Russian ones. Should change the title broBut if expectations drove the form why are we seeing tic-tacs and getting these on video? They're not expected and make no more sense than classical saucers. On the other hand the mysterious airship flap did seem like mimickry or foreshadowing the very next technological step.\s\sThe same with the use of propellers.\s\sIf these are all connected in a consistent way I may propose a new hypothesis -\s\sThe 'visitors' are able to create either\s\s1. illusionary craft (that are material enough to appear on video and camera) but not necessarily physical as we understand it\s2. possess physical craft that can shape shift by advanced programmable materials\s3. construct purpose made craft that change in appearance over time and in different missions\s\sand that one motive for this apart from for technical reasons evolution of our weaponry is that the craft are intended to get us to think technologically about flight. The airship flap was intending to start the process of human flight.\s\sFlying saucers might be the next step and already achieved and whatever these tic-tacs are the step after that.\s\sI don't put a lot of stock in this. I think whilst it is true that human expectations do influence what is described in reports this in part can be due to the effect of memory and post-experience rationalisation.\s\sThere is also a during-experience rationalisation that can influence what is being seen or not seen. The most well known example of this is the man in the gorilla outfit at the basket ball game that most people do not see despite being close to the centre of vision. The brain already knows that people dress strangely at sporting events and so totally screens it out.\s\sSo we then have some further things to consider -\s\sThe UFO is not fully physical and its appearance is entirely manifested by the desire of its operator\s\sThe UFO is not fully physical and its appearance is manifested by the combined observation of the operator and the external human observers and might be thought of as existing at the interface of 'dimensions'.\s\sThe UFO is not fully physical and is entirely manifested by human observers\s\sThe UFO is what it is and physical but appears differently to us which manifests its appearance to the extent recordable on camera by a strange bubble that interacts with us the observer\s\sThe UFO may impact human observation perception independently of cameras and the UFO may cause hallucinations as a by product of fields that it generates both intentionally or not intentionally.\s\sAny combination of the above could be occurring.\s\sEDIT typosIn all cases all happens as if it was an intended enigma to solve in order to stimulate humanity a stimulus shaped in the form of an enigma.\s\sMythological creatures of antiquity or in many cultures often present an enigma to the heroes once this latter solves the enigma it gives him somehow a key that helps him in his quest/goal. Sometimes the hero is blocked until he finally solves the enigma and can continue to move forward.Vall√©e is referring to a control system which is global and specific to humans. I believe he is suggesting something so complicated and controversial that it can‚Äôt be explained without serious ridicule or with our current scientific methods. He has tried to explain it many times but people simple don‚Äôt understand. My interpretation of his writings and the evidence is that when he says human consciousness he is referring to a human gestalt consciousness. In other words the control system is our combined awareness or ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äù trying to interact with us to assist us.... very much like how we take a synthetic drug to interact with our cells for longevity. \s\sIf that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense that‚Äôs what I mean by complicatedHi could you please explain further what you think? if you like please pm me.

We need some truth![deleted]With all the madness going on UFO reports do not seem exciting anymore. :(Says you I need a good ol' distraction and this shit gets me pumped!I wonder if we are getting to a saturation point now people are just meh another one.Very coolThank you!I just saw one of these 20 minutes ago. Any logical explanation? Could it be a string of satellites? Looks like it was moving to a similar speed as one in a south east direction.if you see a line of lights in the sky slowly move in one direction at a consistent speed it's almost certainly starlink satellites. They don't even need to be in a perfect line since a lot of them are being positioned so they start moving out of sync with the rest of the line. If you like you can go [here](https://satellitemap.space/) to see live tracking of all Starlink sats to see if they are flying over wherever you are looking in the sky.\s\sIf you use [this link](https://www.heavens-above.com/StarLink.aspx) you can set the time for when you saw the sats and see if they were near you at the time.The cigar-shaped one was very interesting.All UFO¬¥s more or less at the same height.my god the toxicity in the commentsThank you very much. You're quite right. A few manipulated brains repeat each other like robots.This guys is such a joke... come on lol. Have you actually watched this bumbling idiot? Because if you do he‚Äôll tell you how he saved the world from aliens. Incredible BS. Can‚Äôt believe anyone is sharing this in 2021. ARE YOU HAVING DUMMY PROBLEMS????[removed]I wasted my time watching this last night.....thumbs DOWNPhil Schneider really? Yes OP you post the worst stuff. It's bad enough you post your own shitty YouTube account.that first video the Swindon England one is truly fascinating.  The beginning where it looks like a disc is like a lot of historical photos back in the Flying Saucer days. The Blue Planet Project is a mysterious document that created no small stir among ufologists when it surfaced in the early 1990s. The document details a lengthy history of government involvement in‚Äìand alliance with‚Äìcertain extraterrestrial entities that purportedly inhabit and/or visit Planet Earth on a regular basis.I dig it"

0,classified,RealLifeConspiracy,10,So the last part that this video makes is that pharisees and other egyptians had a spell for preventing the loss of a man's heart in the afterlife a punishment given to those who essentially lie or who were not good during their life. For example a thief would cast this spell to prevent the overlords/gods from seeing that he indeed was a thief (and pretending that he was not) allowing him into paradise. I love how people no matter who or when are convinced that they can deceive those that they would call gods especially if a god were truly omnipotent then they would be fully aware of your attempts to deceive them in it's entirety would they not?My question is \sAre these objects a product of Earthling technology \sOr alien . . . .these aliens look uglyThis is complete bullshit.

0,classified,TinFoilHatPod,5,"At least stick to the cases at this rate we'll be here until next year while you list all the Gods from mythologyThe video mentions a debunker of Sitchin named Michael Heiser and I checked into his material once. The first debunking claim of his that I came across was that nowhere in the Sumerian texts was the word ""Anunnaki"" used. I checked where he said to look and indeed that was true.\s\s*But*....\s\sThe texts actually use the phrase translated as ""Anuna gods"" instead which is just an alternate form or variation of ""Anunnaki"". Do you think Heiser doesn't know that? Of course he does. He's deliberately deceptive in his most basic claim. I didn't read another word of his obvious disinfo bullshit.\s\sIt all just reinforces the truth and importance of Sitchin's work on the Anunnaki. Otherwise why would anyone pay a lame lying sack of crap like Heiser to put people off the trail with fake-ass ""scholarship""?#Carlos CastenadaSo no good news?But how do they know it‚Äôs a hybrid?
