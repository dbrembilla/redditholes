0,1984isreality,ABoringDystopia,302,"Daily reminder that Orwell was right.\s\sAnd as always it's amusingly ironic that Orwell was a Brit and it's the UK that's taking the lead in proving that he was right.Foucault begins spinning in his grave. He spins faster and faster. Eventually he spins so fast the rotation of the Earth slows. Finally the momentum of his body rolling in the grave brings the Earth to a standstill. Gravity fails the Earth disintegrates we all die.\s\sThanks UK.\s\sEdit: Damn apparently somebody never read their *Discipline and Punish*.

Helping normalize creepy behavior by big daddy government.Wow.if they actually had money to pay people to watch you on public transport they wouldn't be spending it on an advertising campaignYou think they just have that ad to deter crime?I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre not watching me because I‚Äôm hiding in my well-appointed man sanctuary spitting on your SO-CALLED ‚Äòsociety‚Äô.Didn‚Äôt they literally invent that as a TV show?This looks like a still from *Children of Men*.

No doubt in my mind.Or the British government mistook 1984 for an instruction manual and loved it so much that they wanted to pay homage.I would also like to think thisSo it‚Äôs technically not fit for this sub?Man I really want to believe that is true. \s\sSomeone trying to destroy the dystopia from within the system itself an inside agent of the people - may he be forever blessed if that is the case.r/theyknewThis post is kind of perfect for this sub. This sounds like a nobrainer I know. But what I mean is that this is exactly the kind of stuff I imagine when I think about ""a boring dystopia"".\s\sSad what times we live in.A dystopia so boring it can't even create effective looking propaganda and has to borrow from artists that criticized it half a century agoThis really has been the story of the 2010's governments and corporations coopting the language of irony and dissatisfaction w/ capitalism/the state to sell products and reinforce themselves.  It's woke corporations and their weird twitter accounts Trump's repackaging of his reactionary authoritarian policies as being revolutionary anti-elite anti ""deep state"" etc.I feel like the graphic artist did a malicious compliance type deal and no one who had an opinion was educated or well read enough to notice so with white glove it was waved in.My favorite part of dystopia is when I point out how dystopian things are people think I‚Äôm ‚Äúbeing a crazy person‚Äù\s\sThe go-along-to-get-along attitude of self-imposedly discarding freedoms that countless people have given their lives for us to have is the silliest part of our times. \s\sWhat the fuck are these eyes protecting us from?Ourselves of course. It's our own fault that we can't adapt to the changes being made to society. The government doesn't want to punish us for desiring free will and equality but *rules are rules*.> What the fuck are these eyes protecting us from?\s\sI mean I don't know if you've ever been to or lived in London but busses there are fucking WEIRD. I got a bus to uni and there was some dude on there on the phone straight up admitting to sexually assaulting someone at work.\s\sSaw a video on here a while back of some woman trying to hold up a bus because the driver wouldn't let her on.\s\sSaw a news story recently about a homophobic attack on 2 women attacked on a London bus.\s\sNot gonna try to defend this poster but there's no way people would be better off without the cameras.

We're living much more in Brave New World rather than 1984.I‚Äôd honestly love that as a poster hung up in my room.The art is a poor choice but in what way is having cameras on busses a problem?That's eyeronicThe poster is tasteless but honestly it's just calling attention to a security camera. I don't see why that would matter at all. If something bad happens a camera is an impartial witness and nobody ever bothers to check the footage unless something actually does happen. I don't see the downside here?Yep they are just advertising the fact they have cctv after there have been some high profile attacks on buses.\sIt's basically a smile you are on cctv but fancier.I feel that it's just a bit of dark humor really. I am not hugely against security cameras to take my words with however many grains of salt.I don‚Äôt see the problem.

The whole ordeal was labeled a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù and a ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù between the firefighters and that one specific rep. \s\sSo either Verizon is lying out their ass and throwing a scapegoat (most likely) or their entire network can be stalled because of one asshole rep. Either way total shit companyBecause capitalists get to set their own lawsMoney.\s\sNothing is illegal when you ~~bribe politicians~~ lobbyThe shit people get away with in America.. FuckWow Verizon is officially in the same category of evil corperation as NestleRemember the more heartwarming the super bowl ad the more evil the cooperation (usually)\s\sLook at the feel good stuff. Pay no attention to the real world.The throttling is part of their network‚Äôs built in traffic shaping. This means that the network is perfectly capable of performing the opposite move to instead throttle down non mission critical devices in order to maintain reliable service where it is needed. I feel sorry for the poor sales rep that was thrown under the bus here for doing *exactly* what they are trained to do.Same. But this is the reality of our society right?\s\sSomeone takes the fall whether they deserve the fall or not.Verizon is the enemy to progress never forgetCrassus is that you?People have short memoriesThe better question is why haven't they switched to a new companyA lot of the country has no other optionsThey're just mad they lost out to AT&T on the FirstNet buildout contract.I work in public safety and we use Verizon data mostly because there have been total failures of other networks during emergency events. During our last large scale disaster ATT had major issues and was down through much of the disaster area. Most ATT device users had to connect to Verison hotspots and use WIFI calling to make calls.Isn't this what Net Neutrality was supposed to fix?It did for the provider.

It's the government's job to make sure this stuff doesnt happen right?Tulsi and Yang are anti-establishment to you? Okay...Pretty much just BernieYang... anti-establishment... pick one OP.Kids access to porn is the establishmentIt's sort of astonishing to me that the DNC and its cronies apparently still haven't figured out why Trump won.\s\sThey think it's some sort of bizarre uber-right neo-fascist thing and I'm sure that's some part of it but those voters are on the fringe - they're loud and noticeable but they're not why he won.  He won because of all the votes he got from people who just wanted to vote for somebody other than the corrupt sack of shit the establishment was trying to shove down their throats.  That's why he beat Jeb in the primary and it's why he beat Hillary in the general - because he was somebody other than the corrupt establishment sack of shit.\s\sAnd if the DNC hadn't fraudulently rigged the primary Bernie would've likely beat Hillary and then he might've beaten Trump too because he too is somebody other than the corrupt establishment sack of shit they're trying to shove down our throats.\s\sYet here we are four years later and what are they doing?  Trying to shove corrupt establishment sacks of shit down our throats and doing everything they can to torpedo the anti-establishment candidates.\s\sIt's almost as if they actually *want* to lose.  Again.The DNC abandoned their base to go where the money isright when there was a huge wave of ""Bernie or bust"" and left a huge swath of people feeling like they were not represented not just by the DNC but by the system as a whole. They then had the gall to say that everything was great.\s\sThere are a lot more candidates going for a more representative approach but instead of collectively realising where their strengths lie the DNC is more fractured then ever.\s\sIf Biden or Warren win the primaries the GOP will win the presidency. If Sanders gets in it will be very tight. To have a landslide victory the DNC need to convince their base their donors and some Republicans to get behind whoever they pick. I could see that being Yang if they get behind him but as it stands he has a lot of ground to cover and is not getting the support he needs from the DNC as a whole.Bernie fundraising and endorsing Hillary was in the WikiLeaks DNC Emails long before it happened.\s\s\sHere's a list of relevant emails\s\shttps://heavy.com/news/2016/07/wikileaks-emails-clinton-bernie-list-directory-photos-most-damaging-worst-rhode-island-delegate-fec-jvf/Tulsi?

Perhaps it may be because the employees  themselves believe that they are doing a ""service"" to the nation or it is patriotic or something to that effect.I wouldn't go so far as to say they're efficient at what they do.

This is one of many reasons I'm praying for real change in 2020!It's instructive to read some Charles Dickens to read up on what society becomes when debtor's prison is a thing.The fact that teachers in general are expected to sign loyalty oaths even to the US is pretty bonkers if you think about it.

Holy shit that's amazingIsrael are the new nazi's.I mean Israel is fascistNah the story of the 21st century is that the media is using an exaggerated ""rise of fascism"" to further help divide the country on social issues and ""hate"" to make it more difficult to rise up against the rich elite. (Its just another issue for wedge politics) I am not saying facism does not exist whatsoever mind you. \s\sIsrael is apart of this because of how many rich Jewish people influence our own government. But this is more of a symptom rather than the disease itself. \s\sDo not ever forget that one day we are going to overthrow the elite.  This is the prime objective into securing a safe and prosperous future for everyone. I fail to see why a person's stance on the BDS movement has any bearing on their ability to be a teacher. Pro-Israel Anti-Israel why does your stance on another country have any bearing on your ability to work in the USA? We should be capable of working alongside people who disagree with us politics doesn't have to infiltrate every aspect of our lives.\s\sThe Texas statute in question: \s\s>Sec. 2270.001.   \s\s>Sec. 2270.002.

Texas has about 100k Jews and most are Democrats and usually pretty liberal (I mean about 80% were against moving the embassy towards Jerusalem).  So who pushes for this?  \s\sThe Christian right.  Texas has about 14 million Christians and they believe that once Jews are gathered in Israel and are converted to Christianity the prophecy will be fulfilled and Jesus will rise from the grave.  Around this time two thirds of Jews will die because they did not accept Jesus.  \s\sSo in order to get these votes they come up with this crazy legislation which is popular with people who believe that we are here in order to fulfill the prophecies to try to kill any fair or unfair criticism of Israel.  And it's usually focused in schools and colleges because they are breeding grounds for all types of movements.  \s\sIt has nothing to do with a person's stance on the BDS movement.This is phenomenally unconstitutional. Requiring an oath to a foreign power on US soil. I get that Israel needs some level of protection but this is unbelievable.Israel needs no protection Looks like the courts are already heading in the right direction on this one. A similar law in Kansas was litigated earlier.\s\shttps://www.aclu.org/news/first-judge-blocks-kansas-law-aimed-boycotts-israel\s\shttps://www.aclu.org/news/after-court-defeat-kansas-changes-law-aimed-boycotts-israel\s\s> In April the Legislature enacted changes to the law narrowing its scope in three ways.

Israel is a militaristic rogue state with a history of human rights abuse and imperialism.This has more to do with AIPAC spending millions lobbying every year and less to do with politicians themselves.\s\sIf a politician doesn't support them they just go and fund his/her opponent.It's important to remember that AIPAC does not represent ALL Jews just very conservative Jews.

Based on information available on Alexa analytics other sites that have experienced sharp drops in ranking include WikiLeaks Alternet Counterpunch Global Research Consortium News and Truthout. Even prominent democratic rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International appear to have been hit.""All entirely circumstantial. Downturns in hits could just as easily be due to news fatigue. The 24/7 news cycle was Trump 24/7 for the first months after the inauguration but they've since moved on to other news items. \s\sI hate to say it but the sky **IS NOT** falling.[deleted]the problem isn't for the woke. it's that it makes it harder for folks to get woke.DDG cribs heavily from Google's results list.\s\sAs does Bing.\s\sNow that Google's done the yeoman's work of optimizing algorithms and serving up lightning fast results competitor search engines routinely just leverage what Google's already doing and tweak it a bit.\s\sUnless you want to sit down and spin out your own massive data engine for web-crawling and information aggregation (and good luck with that - Alta Vista Yahoo and Nexus Lexus all went to the graveyard trying to compete) you either learn from the best or go the way of the dinosaur.It's an algorithm. A black box of computer thinking. You tell it what you want to do (your inputs) and it ranks them (the outputs). It's hard to show why it did it and how. \s\sI feel the perception given by the article is that google did it to hurt us. When it's very possible that they used terms that they wanted to describe something of 'low-quality'. The computer independently started ranking these sites lower. \s\sI wished they reached out to google to get this problem corrected but I don't see anywhere in the article that they did. > It's hard to show why it did it and how.\s\sIt's hard sure.  But it's very possible.  In fact part of the job of the search engine firm is to understand - mathematically - why results are ordered in a certain way.\s\sIt's very likely that certain sites are getting lowballed simply because they are not ""mainstream"".  The ACLU is after all an advocacy organization and not a news organization.  So if you're looking for news on a particular SC ruling it's not unreasonable to see periodicals top the list over ACLU news briefs when searching information on the topic.\s\s> I wished they reached out to google to get this problem corrected\s\sCorrected to what?  Are sites like Wikileaks and Truthout *due* a certain amount of web traffic simply because the Google engine prioritized them higher up the results chain before now?  Are sites benefiting from the change receiving an unfair advantage simply because they didn't have it before now?\s\sI'm sure the folks at Breitbart and Infowars are livid now that they're no longer regularly appearing on the front page when someone Googles Trump or Clinton.  But I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.Seems to me they singled out ""higher journalistic quality"" sites and called them low because the one thing they have in common is not adhering to the MSM's low information/pro-monopoly capitalsm prowar propagandizing script.To be fair quite a lot of this is if not fake news opinion and analysis masquerading as news. Unabashedly left-wing sources while they usually don't outright lie about the facts the way Macedonian Trumpbloids do do tend to cherrypick employment data and seamlessly mix analysis with fact more often than I would be comfortable with. But has there been any noticeable decrease in the prevalence of even worse right wing fake news sites like Daily Caller Fox News Redstate Breitbart or Newsmax? If anything they've been on the upswing.\s\sThis is only anecdotal but my Google News feed went from zero right wing fake news articles to roughly half of it being articles about how the Obama deep state is secretly conspiring with the gay cabal to destroy Christmas and send white male Christians to Communist reeducation camps and this doesn't change no matter how many times I select ""not interested."" Articles about economic inequality or really economy-related articles from any source to the left of WSJ op-eds went from nearly nonexistent to completely nonexistent. Google has apparently decided that The Guardian NPR and the New York Times are fake news but Breichbart isn't.\s\sThey can't possibly believe that Trump's aggressive foreign policy and proud hatred of and desire to destroy California and everything in it could be beneficial to them. And there's no way that they do. Google's overriding aim is the elimination of taxes and regulations for themselves so they can grow into an even wider-ranging monopoly and pass their externalities on to the shell of the middle class. It's the same with any other corporation it's the reason Amazon's founder bought the Washington Post. Their agenda is political but not ideological in nature. They have their set of anti-consumer single issues and know long-term loyalty to no particular political group.\s\sThey once propped up socially left-wing Democrats who also happened to be somewhat progressive economically because they were scared of Republicans' isolationism luddism and hatred of the coasts but now suppress the left because they want to get tax ""reform"" through at all costs. If Republicans turned back to unhinged rants against Commiefornia and librul Yurrop while Socialists promised that Google would be allowed to continue functioning as the only non-state-owned enterprise Google would block Fox News and put the Communist Manifesto on their home page tomorrow. I'd advise ignoring what Google does and directing our efforts toward real life campaigning. The censorship by a company with a near-monopoly on what internet users see is certainly a huge blow but they were always going to suppress the economic side of our agenda once it gained a threatening amount of traction to begin with and there's little we can do to stop them.The algorithm is showing stories that it thinks you will click on.

If you don't want to see those sources you have the choice to block them.\sIt's concerning to me that one search engine has the capability to affect website views to such a degree.\s\sAlso tangentially relevant is YouTube's advertising crackdown where they stopped advertising on videos with words like religion war terrorism politics Syria and a ton of other key words that hurt independent news video makers a lot. I would argue that Facebook has just as much weight as google. > It's concerning to me that one search engine has the capability to affect website views to such a degree.\s\sIt's concerning to me that people don't seek out multiple sources for ***ANYTHING*** they do online. There are multiple search engines. Clearly people who visited these sites in the past know they still exist.

Maybe some people only know how to click on google results rather than seek out the sources they want.  One thought is it's good to read sources that don't fit exactly to my opinions so I can read different perspectives and not always be among like minds.\s\sIf this is mostly about news sources is there a site where you can manually select the sources and topics you want to read and it'll return just what you want to see?  I suppose there is still programming and filtering which could be biased in that too.  Is there any way to prevent bias in anything from the ""free"" services we use on the internet?  All I can think of is know the sources you want to see and go directly to them and/or try various search engines and browsers.  I've used Duck Duck Go more in the past few years.  I don't like it for some things but mostly it's fine.[removed]just go to the sites that are progressive directly!I already do and that is not the damn point; the point is that Google is burying sites for those who do not yet know of them.

It‚Äôs important to remember that 21 Trillion dollars of accounting errors does not mean 21 trillion dollars missing. They just cont each dollar in the wrong place multiple times. So how many trillions in accounting errors begins to look fishy?It's also $21 Trillion cumulative between 1998 and 2015.Right. *""Oh! That's not IT hardware expense it's IT software. Let's just move it...""*This is what nobody ever clarifies when talking about this story.  I mean this is absolutely shocking nonetheless.  There is no reason to misrepresent statistics or use click-baity headlines.21 Trillion seems high to me.  the fact that its not accounted for is the alarming part. where did it go? what did we pay for?Anyone else watch [Pentagon Wars](https://youtu.be/aXQ2lO3ieBA)  recently?That's so real lol The entire national debt...Somebody got hella $$$$$$$$$you mean they dont want to tell us where it isB613Is this the second or third time the Pentagon mishandled trillions or billions of dollars.

The United States has had a military budget bigger than the next several countries combined for decades yet no rival to fight with all that advanced weaponry. If they didn't use that budget probably wasn't likely they'd get more the next year. And yet they do get more the next year and every single year. There isn't a chance in hell all that money was spent on research and development or even super expensive projects like jets or rockets.giving it to defense contractors isnt the issue its the fact that its under the table is the problemObviously there is a hole somewhere in the Pentagon allowing the money to leak out.

0,1984isreality,chomsky,56,"Biden will protect the oligarchs who own the media.He is and has been the media's darling.It's the Republicans weapon and they won't use it yet. It'll only help Bernie which they fear much more. Just wait after the nominations the creepy pictures and testimonies will show up.Because that‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs supposed to function.If I were from the US I'd vote Bernie for sure. He's a legend. \s\sBUT people are totally barking up the wrong tree with the sexual assault thing. Yes Biden is a creepy bastard probably committed sexual assault a bunch of times but it doesn't matter. \s\sThe current president was elected with the full public knowledge of the ""grab em by the pussy"" thing. \s\sBiden supporters will just say it's fake or he did it but it doesn't matter. Some will even like it & say it is evidence of his alpha male leadership prowess. This only upsets team Bernie. It's a dead end. Unless you can literally put him in jail but remember the people putting him in power run the justice system. So eh unlikely. \s\sI hate it too but you know it's true. We have to be realistic. Bernie has to win on positives on riling up the people to vote for good things like socialised healthcare and UBI. Not ""vote Bernie because he isn't Biden.""Honestly at this point the only thing this can do pull the mask down a bit more. This situation proves that Democrats don't give half a shit about priciples: anything can be sacrificed at the altar of political expediency. We already know this will hardly have any impact on the election but it does a great job of exposing just how fake Democrats are.Biden can‚Äôt win. Period.Maybe because the accusers story changed substantially from one year ago when she said he touched her back or neck and there was no sexual intent. Many consider that a serious red flag. So many news sources may have already considered her allegations but ultimately found them incredible. And in context many are skeptical because she chose to politicize her story and because this literally just happened to franken another senator who was entirely innocent but was still forced to step down based on false accusations.And yet her brother and friend corroborate that she told them about it after it happened.  DNC should do a proper investigation.üòÜ Literally every word you wrote is false. You‚Äôre most likely a paid troll but in any case you‚Äôre a perfect example of how Democrats are totally unserious about sexual harassment or any identity politics issues really. It‚Äôs all just a pathetic attempt to manipulate voters into protecting the establishment. \s\sWhile I‚Äôm not addressing our paid bot friend here other people should know the truth behind his many many lies. Her story has not changed. She never said nothing happened. This is a separate story she did not at first wish to tell. She has not recanted any of the other stories. \s\sZero news sources ‚Äúalready considered‚Äù her accusations. Zero. That‚Äôs the entire point. No one verified her employment. No one contacted Biden. No one contacted the people she contemporaneously told about the incident (this is considered critical in no-witness cases like this). No one even *responded* to her and in fact mainstream organizations refused to respond even to other reporters until their hand was forced. \s\sThe first reporter to really dig in was the exact same person who broke the Kavanagh accusations. Credible then suddenly not credible now?\s\sShe has tried to tell this story repeatedly only to be denied including when she saw Lucy Flores. The timing is entirely the fault of Biden and his team for stonewalling up until now. \s\s**This is exactly what MeToo and TimesUp are about-‚Äîthe rush to circle the wagons around powerful sexual abusers and viciously attack the women who accuse them so that they *won‚Äôt* get a hearing. \s\sEven if Reade turns out to be a literal hologram created in a laboratory *nothing* can now redeem the behavior of the toxic Biden Bro Lynch mobs. Nothing.Don't sexual assault victims commonly have this same issue though? Regardless of it being true or not the accusation due to its seriousness is news worthy i'd say. Are we supposed to seriously believe that this story wouldn't be picked up if it were about Sanders? I mean they latched onto a story about how apparently Bernie Sanders told Warren that a woman couldn't be president in 2020 in spite of him famously trying to convince her to run in 2016. Also what kind of reasoning is this with Franken? So because Franken resigned 2 years ago it means we should just ignore any claims made against powerful men in the democratic party?

However the narrative is that al-Qaeda are religious zealot terrorists for terrorism's sake motivated by 72 virgins in heaven etc. If you're working on convincing them to ""work with us instead"" doesn't that tacitly imply that these are at least somewhat rational actors motivated by actual grievances? I mean just disregarding the rather obvious truth that the US happily employs terrorsts and terrorism so long as it furthers their own ends.US exceptionalism is strong within this oneIf they switch sides it doesn't mean they change religion or ideology.

I couldnt see it well because we had umbrellas on the front line but it was almost certainly meant to intimidate us into retreating. Before we walked up to them one of the leaders told us to look back and we could see a cop car a quarter mile behind us meant to capture lone protesters who did in fact retreat before the crowd. On either side were roads that likely had unmarked vans in hiding (which we *knew* existed). It was a no win situation.Anyone in the streets knows this. We go out there knowing they are going to do it. But we are the people and we will be heard.Yep it's a common tactic. Knowing this protesters must go to protest well armored and coordinated in huge numbers.> How does a community ever trust people who laid a trap for them to hurt them?\s\sYou don't.  And you never should have to begin with.\s\sDe-fund disband abolish.I agree with defund.  I agree 99% should be fired so not to contaminate the new hires.

Then let you go.Why do I pay taxes if others don't have to... I'm literally paying money to these corporations through my taxes even if I don't buy a product from them. It's bullshit.The state has been captured it runs as you would expectI mean the article touches on something but ignores the flip side of the coin.\s\s>Corporations received 84% of CARES act funds.\s\sOkay why ignore the fact that we had the fastest economic recovery in the history of economic downturns while at it?  The decline in the markets was tantamount to a bear market which typically requires at least 1.5-3 years to return to the point the market was at before the down turn.  In this case the recession last 90 days and was back to a bull market within 180 days.\s\sGiving money directly to people would not have done that giving money to businesses did though.  \s\sYou might ask ""how do you know that to be the case?"".  The answer to that is that since FDR's New Deal every time administrations have attempted to stimulate the economy with trickle up stimulus it results in a long dragged out recovery that takes years to overcome.  In fact The New Deal failed so badly that the average compensation per number of man hours worked in a week did not return to pre-crash 1929 levels until after D-Day in 1944 (when we had already been spooling up to produce goods for the war effort for nearly 3 full years).\s\sExamples of this phenomenon:\s\s* FDR's New Deal\s\s* Carter's policies in the 1970s resulting in stagflation\s\s* W Bush policy post dot-com bubble\s\s* Obama policy post Housing bubble\s\sYou can argue about a large number of things but you cannot argue the results of those policies were in the best interests of the American people.  Clearly dragging out economic recovery is not in anyone's best interests.Nice this radicalized me even further left.Non of that has anything to do with what the article is taking about.\s\sWhy should the most profitable corporations in the world be getting corporate welfare well at the same time The government refuses to do anything for normal people.\s\sThese companies are already extremely profitable the richest billionaires have more then doubled there wealth during this pandemic well at the same time everyone else is struggling and now we are finding out that people like Jeff Bezos don't pay anything in taxes well normal people pay still have to pay taxes.\s\sWhat kind of economic arrangement is that?\s\s>In fact The New Deal failed so badly that the average compensation per number of man hours worked in a week did not return to pre-crash 1929 levels until after D-Day in 1944\s\sAnd why is that exactly.... It's because FDR insisted on maintaining a balanced budget and didn't do deficit spending to dig his way out of the great depression. But when WW2 started the US government began deficit spending to fund the war effort and this mass mobilization of the economy is what ended the great depression.\s\s\sAlso this idea that the new deal was a failure is just not true it provided many important progressive policy firsts like old age pensions and unemployment insurance it also helped expand the national park service as well as create many publicly funded construction works that gave people employment as well as creating important infrastructure.\s\sThe only problem with the new deal is it didn't go far enough and FDR didn't spend enough to get the economy going again if he had started WW2 levels of government spending and spent that money on the people we could have seen a peoples recovery to the great depression that would have gotten the economy going again really quickly and put peoples economic well-being before the profits of the few.Ah this must be that leftist mainstream media they're always warning me about.This is the best tl;dr I could make [original](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/twitter-executive-also-part-time-officer-uk-army-psychological-warfare-unit) reduced by 92%.

Their reluctance has been due to two reasons: first media outlets would argue that any attempts to criminalize the mere publication of classified or stolen documents is barred by the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment a proposition the DOJ has never wanted to test; second no DOJ has wanted as part of its legacy the creation of a precedent that allows the U.S. Government to criminally prosecute journalists and media outlets for reporting classified documents.\s\sAnother reason would be that America is a business run society and obviously businesses would not want the government to have the power to tell it what it could do like this.I have never really read up on Assange.

Is he a bad person a good person or something inbetween?Regardless of your opinion of Assange personally the sheer amount of energy put into silencing him and essentially causing him to be imprisoned for 8 years and now being handed over is disturbing to any fan of free journalism and dissent. He founded WikiLeaks a website that publishes leaks of censored or restricted documents especially those pertaining to war spying and government corruption.  See [here](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/wikileaks-greatest-ever-stories-scandals/) for some highlights.\s\sMost recently WikiLeaks attracted controversy for having published leaked DNC emails showing that the US Democratic Party conspired to favor Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders during the presidential primaries.

He was granted asylum by Ecuador in 2012 and has been residing in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since then to avoid becoming a political prisoner of the US or another Western regime.

One report dated February 27 2017 states that since the movement ‚Äúgenerally followed the jihadist insurgency model while active we can expect the individuals who fought for and supported it to follow a post-insurgency model after its collapse.‚Äù Drawing comparisons with post-Soviet Afghanistan the report warns ‚ÄúWhile we can expect to see the continued spread of the anti-DAPL diaspora ‚Ä¶ aggressive intelligence preparation of the battlefield and active coordination between intelligence and security elements are now a proven method of defeating pipeline insurgenciesThe best part.. they didn't even have a license for any of it lmaoooThe attacks on the protestors are clearly outrageous.\s\sBut regarding the pipeline itself I wonder if someone could give me a truly impartial source of the pros and cons. If I understand it pipelines are better for the environment than carrying oil with tankers since tankers are more likely to spill. If the Dakota Access Pipeline *does* spill it damages an important water source but *if* built properly the chances of that happening are very less? \s\sI haven't really researched this but in the past I do know that people have for example protested building nuclear plants when they are the safest form of alternative energy because they are worried about potential damages. It's already leaked [3 times](https://youtu.be/Wozxc9DGNRY) and I'm not even sure it's finished with the building yet. \s\sOn nuclear energy watch [this](https://youtu.be/eTXGbmlSra8) video on Fukoshima for example. Yes they are safer but they can still have devastating effects. Chomsky may have also commented on nuclear energy somewhere.[This](https://thegrayzone.com/2021/08/13/cdc-fda-women-covid-19-vaccines-menstrual-disruption/) Grayzone?It seems like a decent articleIt's almost as though that article isnt lying: https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/covid-19-vaccines-and-menstrual-cycleWell at least their core values are honest and open now.https://imgur.com/a/bLJonhttps://imgur.com/a/bLJonMatt is one of the best investigative journalists around today.

He also called the narrative ‚Äúoverdone.‚Äù\s\sedit: Organisations that are funded by the German Marshall Fund arent by any means objective. The German Marshall Funds goal was always to strengthen the german / american bond and dependence of germany. German politicians who have been supported and  financed by the GMF are mostly hawkish military industry promoting warmongering neoliberals for example Cem √ñzdemir ( leader of the green party - originally formed as a party for peace nuclear disarmament and ecology - forget that nowadays.) who became successfull again in his party after his funded stay in the US.. See also the ""Young Leader Program"" of the American Council on Germany (whose chairman is Henry Kissinger )  or the Atlantic Bridge ( Atlantik Br√ºcke ) with members like Joachim Gauck former President of Germany and Angela Merkel Chancellor of Germany. \s\sWhat i mean to say is **THAT** is influencing Elections. Stop whining and stop trusting in Think Tanks ""science"" and reports. They do propaganda in the interest of their Funders garnering credibility through make believe scientific sounding job descriptions.Buzzfeed news is unironically better than the New York Times. Lol‚Äîlet‚Äôs not take seriously the fact that Russian propaganda led to the presidency of Trump.\s\sIndeed American intelligence agencies have and probably continue to meddle in the politics of other countries but this in no way lessens the threat of Russia on American democracy. We are seeing the rebirth of fascism. Putin is a dictator along with Xi Jinping the two most powerful nations outside the US.\s\sIf Russians can influence the election and get a clown like Trump elected with minimal resources then we ought to be concerned‚Äînot only for American democracy but also for the European Union and other democratic countries.\s\sAnd election meddling isn‚Äôt the only story‚Äîthey‚Äôre actively engaged in attempting to destabilize American democracy through a variety of other means‚Äîfrom widening partisan rifts to trying to destabilize American agriculture with fake news campaigns targeting GMOs etc...The point was that the narrative behind a lot of this is painting the anti-establishment scene as an umbrella for Russia activity. I don't recall if the article mentions it but it reminds one of the days when labor movements were often targeted as U.S.S.R. fronts. The argument is that this doesn't help democracy it just becomes another tool to inoculate the public against it.>Lol‚Äîlet‚Äôs not take seriously the fact that Russian propaganda led to the presidency of Trump.\s\syea\s\s>If Russians can influence the election and get a clown like Trump elected \s\swait what? you just said.....\s\s>And election meddling isn‚Äôt the only story‚Äîthey‚Äôre actively engaged in attempting to destabilize American democracy through a variety of other means\s\syou seem to have taken the bait.

And if they say nothing ""Oh so you're afraid people will contribute nothing to society but leech off other people's labor like your wife does.""I think there's a diffrence between voluntarly agreeing to give a part of your produced value to the Boss who providies administration of the inns and out of the company and tools that one makes not to mention the workplace itself and being forced by Goverment to pay them a part of your earned wage to support someone that coupd for all you kniw didn't work a day in their life.Maybe if the agreement was actually voluntary but under a system where you need money to survive its really more like blackmail than a consensual agreement. There is too much leverage in the hands of capitalists for wages to ever be truly consensual agreements. This is also why they oppose or try to limit safety nets and welfare as those things take away some of that sweet sweet capitalist leverage. Also you don‚Äôt have to buy into the idea of the government being a mediator for socialism hence that little A in the top left of the subreddit‚Äôs icon.> voluntarily  \s\sOh okay so I don't have to contribute to the system the- oh wait I need money to get food so I can eat\s\sAlso exploitation comes in many forms. This might sound stupid at first but Reddit is very exploitative. You're forced to sign up to a service to interact with content that isn't even produced by Reddit themselves (like 98% of all content on reddit is user-made) and through that account you just made Reddit harvests all sorts of data from you - what communities you interact with what posts you like and what posts you dislike (and by extension they can gather your opinions on everything from dogs to politics even without reading any of your comments or posts) - and ships off all this data to advertising companies who exploit psychology to the best of their abilities in order to claim as much of your money as possible.  \sSure this is voluntary but if you want to interact with any part of the service beyond simply reading content (and they're making that harder too on the mobile website) then you *must* consent to this data harvesting.\s\sThis isn't just Reddit either. Every single big social media platform - Facebook Twitter Tumblr Instagram WhatsApp - harvests your data and sells it. Sure it's voluntary - but good luck having a social life in 2020 without any social media presence whatsoever.I'm not convinced those people exist. Someone who actually didn't work a day in their life would be a distant outlier in some department of wellbeing and worthy of inclusion in society for plenty of reasons analysis being the least of them. But of course we should have as many people as possible *not* working at any time: they'll inevitably turn to writing porn and making video game maps.I'd argue there isn't. If the capitalist system is set up to where you choice is between having a job or starvation then you don't actually have a choice do you? That part is an illusion.[deleted]I don't think it's wrong it's probably just something you haven't been exposed to yet if you interpret the first point as talking about income taxes.

I still do not know what ""facial recognition"" software is or why people are angry about because of these fucking lazy journalists. Can anyone enlighten me?Computers analyze images (from surveillance cameras) and identify individuals by recognizing their face.  They then ""tag"" the person in the photo or video. This can be used to track the movements of people around a city adn build up a database of movements.  As an example the traffic cameras might be monitored and they would know that you go to work every morning around 6:00 am where you work where you habitiually go to lunch when you get home what bars you visit who you are friends with.  Because they are tracking you and others they also know what bars/businesses your friends visit who they are associated with. Who's homes they visit who are in the bars or liberaries or whatever at the same times.  They can build up association maps.\s\sSo if you visit the same establishments as a known terrorist and a friend of a friend has been tagged as being a potential threat to the state they could use this as evidence to pull you into a ""National Safety"" detention seize your assets etc.  Guild by association is much easier if they know everyone you're associated with even if that association is merely that you both go to the same McDonald's and visit the same library.Thank you for your post to /r/FreeSpeech!

Gen. Flynn describes the internal attitude towards Drone strikes: *""We‚Äôve tended to say drop another bomb via a drone and put out a headline that ‚Äòwe killed Abu Bag of Doughnuts'.""*\s\s- Some strikes are directed not at targets but 'indicators' or 'selectors' such as cell phones. In many of these cases it is not really known who in fact is being assassinated at all. Source claims that ""several months"" or even ""years later"" you would find out this ""hot target"" was in fact an innocent mother ""the whole time"".\s\s- Lots of internal references to 'poor' 'limited' or 'insufficient' data being used in assassinations. Also a lot of complaining about the need to meet certain 'requirements' before going through with a strike. Some success made in getting high level officials like Obama himself to 'waive' the need for their approval when getting permission to engage in certain situations. The requirement of ""near certainty' that the target even be present has also been relaxed. There is no 'near certain' requirement when it comes to 'collateral damage'. It is simply recommended that ""collateral damage"" be ""low"".\s\s- In a specific case study *""British citizen Bilal el-Berjawi [is found to have been] under surveillance for several years as he traveled back and forth between the U.K. and East Africa yet [intelligence agencies] did not capture him. Instead the U.S. hunted him down and killed him in Somalia.""* Quite likely UK government cooperated having recently revoked his citizenship. Other comments by officials reflect the internal attitude that the 'capture' part of the 'capture or kill' motto is pretty much a joke. Stats of kill/capture ratio reflect this.\s\s- Ultimately the documents show *""there is only one explicit mention of a specific criterion: that a person ‚Äúpresents a threat to U.S. interest or personnel.‚Äù*I'm interested to know why civilian casualties are so much higher; is it a result of a disconnect because the pilot isn't actually in the drone? Or perhaps something else.[deleted]A reminder to the liberals that Bombin' Bernie supports this programYup. There is no anti-imperialism candidate. On a related note Lincoln Chafee is the only Democratic candidate to have made ending the drone program as part of his platform. Just a little TIL.The brand that is Bernie: what should be apparent are the facts of a 28 year career in politics from a marginal and very white state where voting records make clear that the presumptive outsider has almost always voted in accordance with his party; e.g. tacit support for Pentagon defense contracts and support for Israeli aggression and occupation are obscured by the style by the brand. The tousled hair and the untucked shirt tail. Look closely and you see a mean little man a passive aggressive bully really with the feral eyes of a supermarket night manager or cashier. Any vote for any Democratic presidential nominee is a vote for continuation of imperialism and slaughter of innocents as is any vote for any Repub. The Dem supporters are worse in that they disguise their support for murder with more artful rationales and a higher degree of hypocrisy.Unfortunately this is true :/ I like to think he'd scale it back which is a small victory but it's still unjustifiable and criminal. :/This article is being censured all over Reddit...\s\shttps://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2Fdrone-papersFor real.

I think that alone pretty much explains his popularity with American Liberals. A pet rock would have been virtually deified in that position.Yeah if it had been 8 years of gore implementing major environmentalism changes and possibly not getting us into two prolonged wars it's debatable whether Obama could even have won since his message of hope and change may well not have been relevant.This is because Americans have no idea what left-wing politics actually is. They think the fucking democrats are left-wing for fuck sake.I am sure there are some 'woke' Americans in this sub.Obama and Clinton (both of them) are further to the right than Regan and almost further to the right than Nixon. Many Americans are aware of this. The Democratic party abandoned us in the 1970s and haven't listened to the ""liberal intellectual elites"" at all. lots of international people seemed to like Obama as well[removed]Liberals like him so much because of his strict anti-catgirl policy it's about as left as you can get really.What makes Obama's most terrible policies like the drone program or the dystopian surveillance state he set up *even worse* is the fact that it's now getting handed over to far-right lunatics (Trump Administration) as opposed to center-right hawks (Clinton Administration which is still very bad).The dystopian surveillance state has been running since the cold war.I think he assumed (along with the rest of the democrats) that he'd be followed by Clinton. They acted like the Presidency was her god given right who would naturally follow after Obama as long as she waited her time after losing in 2008.>the drone program\s\sI dunno. I honestly think that we were at a point in time where regardless of who was in charge they would use drone bombings to do enemy strikes. It's no different in principle to the bombings the USA carried out previously except the pilot is flying the plane from far away. That's it. We've always bombed people even innocent people. I don't think anyone expected Obama to completely change that. Unfortunately Democrats are and have always been the same as conservatives when it comes to war and intervention.\s\s>the dystopian surveillance state he set up\s\sThat's been around for decades. Bush set up Homeland Security and the NSA is even older. Obama continued it. Did anyone expect anything different?Trump isn't *far* right - he's just a corporate sellout of the American people (at least more so than the people preceding him).\s\s¬£20 on him selling NSA info on Americans to Facebook anyone?Drones and surveillance predate Obama by years if not decades.  They were testing drones during the Vietnam war for instance while the NSA dates back to 1952.  The CIA started flying unmanned drones over Afghanistan in 2000 with drone strikes starting in 2002.  The current NSA programs that everyone despises also started in 2002.> surveillance state he set up \s\sBush and co. set up the current iteration post 9/11 Obama just elaborated on it. But to be honest the NSA has been spying on the American people since it's inception in 1952.The adulation of Obama and Biden is almost comical in view of the fact that Obama has prosecuted more whistle blowers than all previous presidents combined and Biden sponsored the core provisions of the patriot act.\s\shttp://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/joe-biden-drafted-the-core-of-the-patriot-act-in-1995-before-the-oklahoma-city-bombing.htmltoo trueThe thing to know about this is that these plans were started months ago when he probably thought Clinton had the White House locked. You can't just scrap legislation because a guy you don't like got elected when you've been planning this for months.Regardless of who got elected this is unconstitutional.This isn't ""legislation"" this is about [Executive Order 12333 as described in TFA.](https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/155766682978/fact-sheet-on-eo-12333-raw-sigint-availability)  It can be undone with the stroke of a President's pen just as easily as it was created with the stroke of a President's pen.\s\sThere is zero valid reason for him to still do it.  It's all on Obama.  All he had to do to stop this was to literally just say ""Nah I'm not going to do that"" and then not do it.  Especially considering now he is handing the reigns to someone completely untrustworthy.  (Not to say Obama was trustworthy rather he was untrustworthy because he was intelligent and deceptive.  Trump is untrustworthy because he is a petulant child.)\s\sAnyway bottom line is this is Executive Order territory not congressional legislation and thus easily could be voided or better yet just never been written down in the first place.This was Clinton's means of blaming the guy before her. It disgusts me when neo cons compare Obama and Bernie to socialism. Their ideologies match that of the bourgeois agenda and their blatant imperialism shows. Bernie I don't mind as much as Obama though. He just misleads people about what socialism is about. But you can't blame him since he only adopted capitalist ideas to fit in with democrats.I honestly believe Bernie is a proper socialist who (albeit misguidedly) thought he could change things from within the system. Obama on the other hand...The last bit of ink dribbling from a dying pen. His ""legacy"" consists solely of the things he campaigned against in 2008 (health insurance mandate violation of civil liberties) and that's why his amen corner is shouting so loudly: in the hope that a lot of noise will distract us from the ugly reality.

What Obama actually is  is a token put in place to pass laws and enact orders that would never be passed or would be met with heavy resistance. I have observed that black people have not critically thought about him because the reason they voted for him and the only they see is his color blinded by it they are true colorblind.Obama was center-left and further to the left than any president since FDR.  Important gains were made that we socialists can celebrate but far too much still needs to be done.  The real question is Is incrementalism okay?  If it is then Obama's eight years were incrementally successful.Also Obama was not centre-left he was centre right at best.Well even if incrementalism was ok which it isn't his and Clinton's actions have guaranteed Trump's election which will more than destroy any of the meagre incremental gains he got.[deleted]> Obama was center-left and further to the left than any president since FDR\s\sEh maybe I'm nitpicking here but I'd say Carter was further to the left than Obama was.This is wrong even by Obamas own admission. Obama said in an interview that his political outlook is basically what use to be called an ""moderate republican"". He has also shown admiration for Ronald Reagan perhaps the most reactionary US president after the cold war(perhaps after  Nixon). Obama only seems centre-left because the political climate in the United States is so right wing.\s\sHe even instituted the conservative Heritage Foundations own healthcare plan but now republicans are saying that he ""socialised healthcare""(j wish).[deleted]But not only did he fail to even attempt to cut it down/get rid of hit  he actually expanded it.

You don't need a spying apparatus to abolish it.Also most people on this sub will recognise that capitalism was an improvement on what it replaced feudalism that's not to say that we should then settle but go onto the next stage that will liberate billions more from early deaths.[deleted]I'm sure you can agree there is plenty he should have done less yeah?[removed]The nsa isn't monitoring the government and reporting to the minority party.

They obviously are terrified of people saying ""good I hope he dies"" because if that gets traction and catches on what are the capitalist gonna rebuff with?  \sThe 1% are terrified of the rich being seen as expendable. After all they have been saying for 40 years it's the rich who make the world go round. How terrifying for them to lose that talking point WHILE the people are enraged with them for having helped spread this disease by refusing to close by calling themselves essential businesses?

The very regulations that are there to keep people safe and keep products safe.\s\sSo they can't win the narrative of rich people being good any more so they have to call for civility.\s\sJust a reminder the NRA pushes the same narrative after every mass shooting saying ""no we can't talk about gun control now it's too soon.""\sDO NOT fall for the ploy of them calling for civility while they still expect their workers to die for them from minimum wage.\s\sEdits: some grammar and spellingGood take thank you!!!I worked in one of those meat packing factories when covid hit. They told us it ""wasn't a big deal"". Tried bribing us with ""hero"" t-shirts and candy bars rather than giving us actual material gains while we worked packed like sardines terrified of catching covid while they stayed safe in their cozy offices on the other side of the plant. They even told us it wasn't a big deal while my coworkers were diagnosed with covid. Some died. I hate them and this system to much.im christian and try my best to maintain compassion for even the worst people. but i was still nauseated hearing liberal politicians say ‚Äúnow is the time to put politics aside and pray for the President‚Äôs health‚Äù about a guy theyve been calling a mass murderer and threat to American democracy for 4 years. most of those people never bother to mention the civilians the US has killed let anyone they *actually* consider a ‚Äúthreat to American democracy‚Äù. Like can you imagine any of them shedding a tear over the death of some Taliban guy who pointed his gun at a US soldier once? Going on MSNBC and saying ‚Äúno matter what you think about the Taliban any death is a tragedy. Our hearts go out to Daud‚Äôs familyüò¢‚Äù? LmfaoYeah that shows how the democrat establishment planned on rehabilitating trump like they did bush 43... Ugh. Gross.Luckily for our political nature im a Satanist and hope the absolute worst for all politicians in office profiting on death and even remotely sending ""thoughts and prayers"" to the nazi chief cheeto fuck face in the oval office. Its a balance. As all things should be.When trump was going against the WHO where were those people who called for civility over polictics?\s\sEvery single avoidable death is on the trump administrations hands. Want to determine what would I considere avoidable? Take the gap between US and the next worst affected country and realise the response trump made is an absolute shitshow. He made the disease political and he deserves every bit of ""lack of civility: he gets..Same here. It takes everything I've got not to root for his death. Even when the news broke Osama Bin Laden was killed it was much easier to not celebrate the death than this since I was disappointed he didn't get to stand trial.\s\sI want to ask the people calling for civility what the logical extreme is. If Hitler were deathly ill in 1943 would you call for civility then too? Is there a body count threshold? Is Trump's just not over that threshold yet? Heck how many of them remained civil when Chavez had cancer a few years back?\s\sIn my view you've got to allow people to acknowledge that Trump's death would bring an end to a great source of evil even if celebrating the individual's death and suffering is a bit gauche. Prohibiting people from acknowledging that insulates power from critique.I know it's a repost but it's a timely one.I didn't see it the first time so thank you üëçIt is a good question...wen he changes the rules to suit him at a whimorganised chaos!!!When they ask I provide them empathy that they have not remotely given their political adversaries over the decades...well upon the news Trump had been infected with Covid-19 after effectively helping engineer the most incompetent response to the pandemic in the world among all countries I merely stated that actually Ivan Drago was my favorite Rocky villain.\s\sI always keep this in mind when people ask for my empathy for an adversary like Trump:\s\sOne of my most favorite films and is an indictment against violent right wingers running a country ruthlessly for themselves was actually produced by the Catholic Church. It's called ""Romero"" and is about the violent and brutal El Salvadoran Civil War.\s\sAnd a scene in the film the leftist guerillas has kidnapped the son (also military officer of the right wing military junta government) of a powerful aristocratic general who was recently married and has a daughter with a young wealthy debutante and their family are deeply saddened and want him back (Don't feel too bad this family was helping fuel peasantry/protester massacres and assasinations of clergy and labor leaders).\s\sRomero was the neutral party to try and ask for his release and a line in the film he says to the guerilla ""think of their family"" and the leftist says ""If I did that he'd already be dead"" and my knowledge of the history and what's going on for whatever attrocity this aristocracy and military junta family is facing with their kidnapped son at the hands of they've probably caused/committed 20x as many atrocities against their county's peasantry. If you try to empathize with their family with that fact in mind...you quickly lose all empathy for them.\s\sThe leftist asked for the release of several political prisoners in exchange the right wing aristocracy father refused...so they later picked up his sons decaying body at a local landfill and put it into the back of their limo and drove off.Referring to DJT's covid diagnosis a commenter on an earlier thread put it this way: \s\s""I am against the act of suicide and would not wish suicidal thoughts on anyone but I don't hold the same degree of empathy for a mass shooter that turns the gun on himself after shooting a room full of innocent people""Bottom line a billionaire politician is a conflict of interest manifest...'people' need to get with the programPreach.Silly because your life is more valuable if more people know you exist.\s\sAdditional to your ability to spend money.\s\sThat's why none of us matter. We have not enough money and not enough fans.So you sayin it's time to make an OnlyFans account?So true.Fuck him. He‚Äôs a goddamned murderer. People died because of that man. Civility? I‚Äôll offer none. And when this is over and we‚Äôre on to the next thing they will give us none regardless of how we acted. What use is being the bigger man? I‚Äôm being the bigger man by fighting for the smaller ones not by shedding a tear for tyrants and dictators. Seriously I reiterate fuck that man. I can‚Äôt be clear enough about this.Replace Trump with Bush re: Wars in the Middle East. Same story. We're expected to owe deference and sympathy to the powerful.It's nothing more than a disingenuous manipulation tactic. It exploits the good nature in a person and uses it as a weakness. If you fall for it that is. Don't fall for it. ""They go low we go high"" doesn't work not in this context anyway.Because as a rich person he probably has better healthcare than most USAmericans. It's a honeypot. He probably won't die. On top of that if Pence ain't at risk then that's screwed up.

There are also examples of the times the media was used to stir the pubic into a war or conflict where the WMD bit that the Bush admin lied about would not have been detected I think. This is supposed to help keep fake news from influencing the citizenry because a working democracy relies on an informed public (and an informed public needs to be class-conscious but you can have a public that knows the issues but is still class-bound). \s\s>Fake news has a long history in America. Its most pernicious incarnation is never the work of small-time scam artists. The worst ‚Äúfake news‚Äù almost always involves broad-scale deceptions foisted on the public by official (and often unnamed) sources in conjunction with oligopolistic media companies usually in service of rallying the public behind a dubious policy objective like a war or authoritarian crackdown.\s\s>From the sinking of the Maine in 1898 to rumors of a union-led socialist insurrection before the Palmer raids in 1919 to the Missile Gap in the late fifties and early sixties (here is the CIA‚Äôs own website admitting that one was ‚Äúerroneous‚Äù) to the Gulf of Tonkin lie that launched the Vietnam War to the more recent WMD fiasco true ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is a concerted organized institutional phenomenon that involves deceptions cooked up at the highest levels.\s\sThis is the more problematic fake news in my eyes the one that has had worse consequences but the MIC isn't going to bite the hand that feeds. \s\s>Of course the final omnipresent ingredient in most major propaganda campaigns is the authoritarian solution.

The traffic cone is self explanatory but it looks more complex than that.I think (but don‚Äôt quote me) they‚Äôre dousing it with water.Putting it in a large water container has been used from at least the gezi protests in TurkeyTear gas canisters are essentially a charcoal fuel soaked with various oxidizers (which make it burn hotter/reliably) and irritants (which are activated and dispersed by the heat). Once lit they slowly burn/smoulder like a stick of incense while volatilizing smoke. Tear gas canisters are not just like pressurized hair spray canisters letting out aerosols the canisters are pyrotechnics. \s\s* Cone contains/directs the smoke to allow for next steps\s* Water douses the canister to remove heat. This cools down the red-hot metal container and starts to slow down the burning chemical reactions like splashing water onto a BBQ.\s* Once the case is cooled a bit and the reaction is slowed one can approach with some tongs and pick it up\s* Can then dump the entire thing into a vat of water. This quickly extinguishes the reaction and most of the smoke produced in the mean time is captured in the water instead of going into the air.\s\sEDIT: The umbrellas are a practical and symbolic shield against a couple pounds of literally red hot metal (which happens to be spewing chemical weapons) being hurled at you. At a base level they simply bounce the smoking canisters away from you and your friends. Beyond that they prevent injuries from the impact of metal canisters slamming into you a-la Akira.

Hong Kong was it's own place things to the British but they made a deal with China that after x amount of time they would go back to China and that deal is going to expire soon and they're going to have to become Chinese even though they speak a different language have different customs and live a completely separated life from those on mainland China.Don't tell me strategic thinking from playing video games doesn't translate to the real world.It does.

Just because if he actually shot him in that moment he would have demonstrated that this isn‚Äôt fucking okay and also probably would have been given a life sentence (hopefully)You can't ask others to risk their life for our ideological. Sure you and me would be willing but we can't force it on others.I doubt they would get a life sentence more likely a lifetime paid vacationDid he have a license to sell?I don‚Äôt know.  Why does it matter?This is a pretty common theory - make enough things illegal that it's almost impossible to not break the law on a regular basis and be lax enough in prosecuting those crimes that it's not worth either trying to avoid breaking them or even hiding your tracks when you do break them.\s\sThen whenever the state decides that you have become an undesirable (e.g. for being a journalist that asks too many difficult questions) they'll have a whole heap of crimes that they can now prosecute you with.This is the whole point. That's why broadly written laws and high tech surveillance are so ""effective""The fact that we are expected to obey laws without being explicitly told beforehand what these laws are is proof on its own of the illegitimacy of the legal system. Most people's understanding of the law is essentially through rumour. People almost always have had no hand in the development of laws either. I think if people are reminded of these facts they will quickly rescind their tacit acceptance of legalism.\s\sRegulation is not a bad thing however. I work at sea as a navigator and the rules concerning vessel movement with particular regard to collision avoidance are well codified making navigation much safer. It is not in fact compulsory to follow these rules- this is even enshrined in the collision regulations themselves- however not having done so is regarded as damning evidence in the event of collision.\s\sWhat makes these regulations tolerable is that you have ready access to them you can understand them and see their value and you don't have to worry that if you don't follow them you'll be imprisoned. You don't want your ship to collide with another anyway; the regulations help you to avoid collisions.\s\sLaws should be ditched but there's no reason why people shouldn't abide by regulations as long as they have a hand in draughting them and there are no punishments for noncompliance. If people do not follow such regulations then it is because they see no value in doing so. And why should people have to follow rules that have no value? People regularly do follow regulations without coercion even if they remain largely or wholly unwritten. For example in London even where there is no sign to indicate that you should (although there often are) people will stand to the right side of an escalator to allow people to walk past them on the left. People see the value of the rule and follow it; even though they might not personally benefit at the time and though there are no penalties for noncompliance.\s\sWell that was slightly off-topic. Sorry. I do that sometimes.There have to be *some* rules which there are penalties for violating. Like being a capitalist(like employing people not believing in capitalism) or murder. But in a libertarian (I mean the real version: ie left wing) society sure fewer things need actual laws. Everyone has something to hide.Not me and my monkey!Imagine what they have on the pigs & priests?This is an old-school approach. Ideas like ""no one is above the law"" or ""nation of laws not men"" are intended to counteract that possibility.\s\sSadly we are going that direction as a nation.\s\sThis is a huge deal in modern corporations. Just make rules that are contradictory or so extreme as to be impossible to follow and then selectively enforce. That way corporations can fire *anyone* ""for cause"" giving them complete and total control. Individual people don't have anywhere near the bargaining power of a corporate entity so they can basically live with or quit (or get fired). \s\sMeanwhile less sophisticated (or more authoritarian) employees see the selective enforcement as ""mercy"" or ""kindness"" and love the corporation or their managers for it...\s\sAnd perhaps its prevalence in the corporate world trains us to accept it in public life...\s\sIt's a source of injustice in the world.Punishment is **always** selective. A cogent theory of right and wrong is all that protects the innocent.Nevermind crimes even.\s\sImagine if every word you ever spoke in your whole life -- including what you said when you were 15 and stupid -- including everything you ever said about everyone you know -- imagine if all that had been recorded.\s\sCould that information be used to embarrass or discredit you?  To disrupt your personal relationships?  To ruin your chances say of a political career?  Would the person with the database of that information be able to blackmail you?\s\sThe answer is certainly yes for everyone.To drive normally everyone exceed the speed limit it is a matter of luck or circumstance whether you get caught.Basic rule is to go with the flow of traffic.I wanted to share my other two favorite quotes from this article I found them quite relevant and insightful (if not original ideas).\s\sThe necessity of illegality:\s\s>Imagine if there were an alternate dystopian reality where law enforcement was 100% effective such that any potential law offenders knew they would be immediately identified apprehended and jailed. If perfect law enforcement had been a reality in Minnesota Colorado and Washington since their founding in the 1850s it seems quite unlikely that these recent changes would have ever come to pass. How could people have decided that marijuana should be legal if nobody had ever used it? How could states decide that same sex marriage should be permitted if nobody had ever seen or participated in a same sex relationship?\s\sIt's gettin' epistemological in here:\s\s>living in an existing social structure creates a specific set of desires and motivations in a way that merely talking about other social structures never can. The world we live in influences not just what we think but how we think in a way that a discourse about other ideas isn‚Äôt able to. Any teenager can tell you that life‚Äôs most meaningful experiences aren't the ones you necessarily desired but the ones that actually transformed your very sense of what you desire.\s\sOf course those don't work as well as titles for a submission haha.True true.

Alabama is a cesspool. I'm from Alabama and this pisses me off so much. It seems like it's so often that some official or cop or someone from Alabama does something like this.

Hopefully her lawyer can get her a big settlement from the city over this because they probably won't see prison time because the system is fucked. A lot to digest here but some things that jump out:\s\s- Drone strikes in Afghanistan 10 times more likely to kill civilians than conventional aircraft.\s\s- In one five month period around 90% of those killed were not the target.\s\s- In Yemen and Somalia ratios ""may well be much worse"".\s\s- Official 'civilian deaths' are minimized by counting 'unidentified ""military age males"" as 'enemies killed in action'.\s\s- Also according to source this same trick can in some circumstances somehow also be applied to women and children.\s\s- Former Lt. Gen. Flynn describes the internal attitude towards Drone strikes: *""We‚Äôve tended to say drop another bomb via a drone and put out a headline that ‚Äòwe killed Abu Bag of Doughnuts'.""*\s\s- Some strikes are directed not at targets but 'indicators' or 'selectors' such as cell phones. In many of these cases it is not really known who in fact is being assassinated at all. Source claims that ""several months"" or even ""years later"" you would find out this ""hot target"" was in fact an innocent mother ""the whole time"".\s\s- Lots of internal references to 'poor' 'limited' or 'insufficient' data being used in assassinations. Also a lot of complaining about the need to meet certain 'requirements' before going through with a strike. Some success made in getting high level officials like Obama himself to 'waive' the need for their approval when getting permission to engage in certain situations. The requirement of ""near certainty' that the target even be present has also been relaxed. There is no 'near certain' requirement when it comes to 'collateral damage'. It is simply recommended that ""collateral damage"" be ""low"".\s\s- In a specific case study *""British citizen Bilal el-Berjawi [is found to have been] under surveillance for several years as he traveled back and forth between the U.K. and East Africa yet [intelligence agencies] did not capture him. Instead the U.S. hunted him down and killed him in Somalia.""* Quite likely UK government cooperated having recently revoked his citizenship. Other comments by officials reflect the internal attitude that the 'capture' part of the 'capture or kill' motto is pretty much a joke. Stats of kill/capture ratio reflect this.\s\s- Ultimately the documents show *""there is only one explicit mention of a specific criterion: that a person ‚Äúpresents a threat to U.S. interest or personnel.‚Äù*Man I love The Intercept.

When his cell block was put on lockdown his anxiety spiked. Lockdown meant Orta was restricted from participating in the preparation of his own food. On March 3rd 2015 Orta‚Äôs cell block was served a meal of corn cabbage breadjuice and meatloaf. He didn‚Äôt touch it. He‚Äôd fallen ill a few times after eating the food at Rikers and was convinced he was being targeted and poisoned.\s\s‚ÄúEat inmate‚Äù a CO commanded banging Orta‚Äôs cell with a baton.

It just still blows my mind that people have to join the military before figuring out the military performs brutal violence on behalf of the government. Like that's its job. That's the whole thing. That's the essential purpose of all militaries ever. She couldn't feel comfortable wearing the uniform that's ""presently used to carry out such violence in so many places""... what do people think the uniform represents beforehand? Do people think it's camo for fun? Everybody's fucking carrying assault rifles they aren't hunting deer.I think people have a disconnect in America specifically between perpetrating violence and ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù America or democracy or whatever buzz word. Like people believe specifically that our military executes violence for good causes and that it‚Äôs in some way honorable which would be different in their minds than the wanton and randomized violence that actually exists in any war zone. Once people experience that disconnect between what they‚Äôve been taught and what they experience they‚Äôve always had a lot of ways of handling it mentally. I wish that more people handled it by renouncing the uniform.Remember David after dentist?

This guy is a legal gun owner and gets a gun pulled on him for legally carrying a firearm and legally disclosing it to police??! Come on NRA. Where are you??News flash the NRA is made up of a bunch phonies. They don‚Äôt really care about me and you they care about money in their pocketThe only thing I can see the NRA working towards in this scenario is to repeal duty to inform. Otherwise police abuse of power is most definitely not in their whee house.NRA is tearing itself apart right now but even if they weren't the last few years especially have proven the NRA to have feet of clay.I've seen many cases where the NRA fronts near millions of dollars in the defense of men and women of all races in situations like this.  Ex Shaneen Allen.I think with some stretching you could semi justify this maybe the officer thought that when he was moving his hands he could've reached into a glove box and grabbed something.  \sHowever! This is disgusting and the officers should be firedNra and every gun rights organization deals only with legislation around rights to keep and bear arms.\s\sDealing with situations like this is a shit show of random stuff that would detract from core mission.  Many organizations have sued and gotten court decisions that have affirmed that lawfully carrying a firearm is not cause for a search in many if the federal court districts.  These actions by the nra as well as others are probably why this person won his case in court.  It is not the job of the nra or any other gun rights organization to provide legal assistance for every individuals personal situations.  They have already laid the groundwork for you to win as an individual.  If you would like to see more progress around these lines work to overturn the legal reasoning behind qualified immunity.  That would likely be the best thing regarding keeping police accountable.  Qualified immunity has no bearing in a gun rights organization either.  That is something that is more sling the lines of what the ACLU works on.Terrible... just glad the man made it out alive.  We as citizens and 2A supporters should not allow for this.Glad he won. That was a bunch of bullshit. Totally unnecessary.Got the ticket(s) dismissed afaik the cops got off without consequencesits disgusting how gun owners are harassed by copsPennsylvania v. Mimms 434 U.S. 106 (1977) is a United States Supreme Court criminal law decision holding that a police officer ordering a person out of a car following a traffic stop and conducting a pat-down to check for weapons did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \s\sThe more you know.That is a trash ruling to be honest. This should be reversed.You must watch donut operator. If you don‚Äôt you should he is awesomeWhile you're correct it's still insane that the USSC didn't find that to be a violation.Probably doesn't cover threat of lethal force thoughThought this sub might want to help make sure this doesn't happen to ANY registered gun owner in the USA! I bet we are all outraged over this!!One wrong move.One misunderstood move.I'm glad he had that camera. Cops typically get away with shit like this. Growing up in a predominantly white town and having one of my best friends since we were 11 be black I've seen them get away with some egregious shit more than once. \s\sRemember cops are not your friends.Never give them an inch. When they say it can be either the easy way or the hard way always choose the hard way. Make them get the warrant make them do it the right way.What did he win exactly? The officer get paid time off?

It says due to the video but I suspect he ‚Äúwon‚Äù because he‚Äôd already been given fix it tickets.  And I also wonder if he hadn‚Äôt actually had the issues fixed before his court date.Sucks the taxpayers have to foot the bill for that cop being a total piece of shit maybe they need to start garnishing the wages of all police to lessen the burden on the taxpayers.I say go after the police officers' pensions.Doesn‚Äôt seem like the taxpayers are footing any bill - other than the cops salary etc.\s\sAccording to [this article](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/window-tint-man-held-gunpoint-police/) he ‚Äúwon‚Äù his fight against the tickets he was issued.

If they say yes at any point in answer to this question just leave. If they say no fall back on the other three. If they give you an answer other than yes or no keep asking this question until they give you a yes/no answer. You may need to ask them what crime you've committed.

The fact that he had the gun in the trunk if he's not on his way to or from the range or firearms store he is in violation of state law. He'd be looking at a minimum of 32 months in prison in NJ. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sNot sure where this occurred but he could be in violation of state law.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sNo I do not agree with the law.

Though I realize that‚Äôs sort of the point of posting this.[deleted]He was too animated for a jumpy cop but the cops were way out of line with their response.FYI - [Pennsylvania vs Mimms](https://youtu.be/lwAAoSwXr2U) = an officer can order you to exit the vehicle during a traffic stop for any reason.\s\sA driver can not refuse...\s\sI also like how he refuses to believe a complaint was called into the police...I wouldn't buy that either. ""Hello police? Yes this man is driving a car with window tint that's too dark."" Yeah right.  I've been pulled over 6 times in the past 2 years. Only once have the police made mention of my window tint. (Arizona car in the midwest. I didn't apply it didn't notice anything.) If cops aren't even looking I doubt john q public cares.\s\sMaybe someone did call in a complaint. But it wasn't about window tint. Something about how cagey they are to answer tells me they have something to hide regarding the complainant.I know right? Like he WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING in his car to cause someone to complain about him.I won‚Äôt argue that it was excessive but I bet if he was compliant he wouldn‚Äôt have had a gun drawn on him. That smile when the gun was drawn means that is exactly the reaction that he wanted for his video.I disagree. People commonly smile at inappropriate times in a way that doesn‚Äôt reflect their true emotional state. It may be akin to a young child smiling while being disciplined (if you have kids consider how hard it is sometimes not to smile back and undermine the whole thing). I think him smiling in response to the extreme stress of having a gun pointed at him is suggestive of slight emotional immaturity more than being pleased with the situation. I personally perceived him as experiencing great fear when he saw the pistol though my view may be biased by having had a gun pointed at me before.\s\sEdit: As far as this being excessive force where I‚Äôm from police reacting to a lawfully carried weapon with hostility is so culturally unacceptable it‚Äôs unlawful for a LEO to disarm or physically restrain someone carrying a weapon unless they have probable cause (i.e. they‚Äôre making an arrest). The guy in this video didn‚Äôt comply with the officers‚Äô lawful commands perfectly but by my standards this is excessive.Yeah how dare the untrained civilian act inappropriately when the trained taxpayer-funded officer draws her deadly weapon (something that is considered by many states to be not only the threat of deadly force but the use of it too) and points it at his head... for not obeying a bullshit commandNope try again.\s\sThat‚Äôs a man who‚Äôs calm and collected under stress.> but I bet if he was compliant he wouldn‚Äôt have had a gun drawn on him.\s\sProbably. Some cops really don't like it when people know and exercise their rights.\s\s> That smile when the gun was drawn means that is exactly the reaction that he wanted for his video.\s\sYou never seen or heard of a nervous or uncomfortable smile before? Sometimes when people are getting physically violated i.e. sexually assaulted or raped they actually laugh. It's a psychological phenomenon wherein the human brain is searching for an appropriate reaction to the situation and can't find one. It's basically the freeze-response.The kid is a royal douchebag. Maybe if he followed the law and wasn‚Äôt asking for a confrontation he wouldn‚Äôt end up with a gun in his face. Punk gives gun owners a bad name.He didn‚Äôt do a damned thing wrong. He cooperated the entire time but didn‚Äôt roll over and be their bitch.Missed the whole point there didn‚Äôt you fudd?> Punk gives gun owners a bad name.\s\sI agree; fuck that cop.Using this as some sort of ""look how bad anti-gun people are"" is ridiculous.\s\sHe wasn't suspended for not being anti-gun nor was he suspended for not wanting to have an opinion. He was suspended because the school didn't want to leave him unsupervised and he ignored direction to leave the classroom. The post even mentions an ""alternative study hall"" for people that didn't want to walk out and he chose to ignore the rules and stay put.\s\sMeanwhile plenty of students were suspended or otherwise got in trouble for walking out of school. Those students also weren't suspended for their beliefs on gun control they were suspended from walking out on classes which is against the rules in most cases.\s\sStop using completely irrelevant points to argue one side vs the other.I think the point is the school shouldn't have had an alternative study hall.  Hold class as usual and punish the truancies.  It was a normal school day and should have been treated as such.As far as the Yountville shooter guy goes it's quite clear his revenge was based on the women in that workplace being unqualified and not being able to handle someone with PTSD. They probabaly lied about being sexually assaulted by him to get him kicked out of the program.\s\sDont hire women. They are the causes of mass shootings"

And this thing with the green light that we are supposed to take symbolism from I just don't see it."" (""And then everyone clapped"" I know how it sounds lol)Way to dumb downSeems illegal. Sounds like they have a case.\s\sBest of luck to them.\s\sDon't know what else needs to be said.

It would definitely keep her from *saying* she's boycotting israel. This pledge like most bullshit you get from the right isnt designed to work. It is a symbolic gesture to make their stupid supporters feel good. Which is exactly the same tactic employers use when screening out potential employees for illegal reasons.Seems suspicious. Some sort of on-purpose foolish mistake to put this into a contract. False flag false flag! lol no - but it's fucking weird and doesn't pass the sniff test.Why would a public school educator have to sign such an oath?  That's bullshit. Seems like an obvious play to say ""Hey look at this Muslim/Arab-American person who won't agree to protect Israel!""  How about this:\s\sIsrael is an ally of the US and an important one. Alliance means the US has vowed in the name of all it's citizens to not attack Israel. People promoting boycott attack Israel economically therefore the Government funding them with salaries could be seen as breaking of the alliance.\s\sI don't like the ""oath"" part at all but I agree that the State should not be seen as funding people openly hostile to allies.I wonder if Jordan Peterson a man that rose to fame on c16 compelled speech is going to talk about Compelled Loyalty to a foreign government.[deleted]Nobody is forcing people to support Israel only to refrain from attacking it.\s\sI'm not sure it's a good idea but maybe it's right for a government to not employ people with openly anti-Israel actions. Diplomacy and such.\s\sIf French government employed anti-Americans would you say ""well that's the freedom of speech"" or be like ""oh fuck France they are paying people to hate us""?\s\s&#x200B;This is something great to bring attention too. However then implication that free speech advocates are hypocrites puts a bad taste in my mouth. Especially sense this is a breaking story.

This echoes of the UN migration pact nonsense and related proposed EU legislation that could make it a hate crime to speak out against 3rd world migration into EuropeJP sees Israel as being fundamentally on the side of ""The West"" so I doubt he'll comment either way. It's a shame because having a double standard when it comes to Israel gives ammunition to his detractors on the Left and the Right.When has Jordan Peterson made any comments on or about Israel?And here shows the hypocrisy of the mates I follow... sad indeed. I have seen it before. Eerily quiet. In the same way pro-gun advocates usually never come out to defend blacks who get in trouble involving firearms. There was a major case that is on the tip of my tongue that I can‚Äôt think of... anyway. What is with the editorialized headline? Nothing but a dishonest attempt to smear the straw man that is the ""free speech warrior"".\s\sI suppose OP is also part of the group posting [these comments in /r/politics](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a6zain/a_texas_elementary_school_speech_pathologist/ebz2axh/). Oh that Peterson is a Jew lover! Oh my goodness his poor wife.> these comments in /r/politics\s\sWhat exactly is wrong about that comment?First i disagree with this pact in it's totality.\s\sSecond its already a law suit so hurrah for America. \s\sThird this article seems to be arguably taken some things out of context considering the language isnt quoted as is but single specific words are being taken as the ""qoute"" as seen here:\s\s>vowing that she ‚Äúdoes not‚Äù and ‚Äúwill not‚Äù engage in a boycott of Israel or ‚Äúotherwise tak[e] any action that is intended to inflict economic harm‚Äù I'm curious if it simply restricts behavior while on the job rather than restricting behavior in all of one's life.\s\sIf it restricts behavior at work it is fine as it restricts conduct related to employment.  Conversely it it restricts behavior outside of work then I have a problem with it (though primarily because it is the government).\s\sSide note: I'm assuming OP is not a libertarian and came in here to troll.  What is people's problem with people having principles valuing liberty as the greatest political good?Im very much a libertarian. Not the ""Dodge Ram Libertarianism"" type but the true kind. And we are as condemned by the Dodge Ram types as are true liberals by the ""Social justice warrior"" kind. Knowing what I‚Äôve seen from my home state of Kansas this is also a restriction on private speech. It‚Äôs not novel either as certain pro-Israel lobby groups have been pushing this for a few years since the BDS movement got traction. They started with state employees but their end goal is to expand it to all citizens as they‚Äôve tried in the US senate.Kill meI am happy to side with free speech but god damn are you not keeping track of all the free speech abuses already going on?Everyone seems weirdly quiet on this oneThis is a murky one. On the surface the law looks to me to be intended for business action and state funding. However including the text ""...or otherwise taking any action..."" seems like it could bring political assembly etc. into the equation (I'm not sure if speech constitutes an action in the legal world although ""freedom of speech"" implies certain actions that are not simply speech). At best this was poorly written and not intended to restrict individual speech. Even giving the benefit of the doubt I'd still disagree with it although I'm not certain what legal statute I'd argue on at the moment (excluding the free speech argument). I'd argue that it's illegal for a state to make an agreement with a foreign power but that's not technically what happened here. Anyway best of luck to her. I hope she wins!*QuietThis is the where the real fight for free-speech is happening: The hegemonic ideological brainwashing of our country vs free individuals.\sThanks for this read op.The law itself is not good.   \sI don't think it's good as it gives ammunition to antisemites and supporters of genocidal Islamist movements - It's like what JBP said about someone who's a paranoid - don't persecute them legally as you'll prove them right.   \s\s\sI think the better way to combat movements such as BDS  is to expose their bigotry by the virtue of our counter-idea exposing them as liars racists and frauds which they are.   \sLegislation is just shifting some kind of overton window into giving legitimacy to something that should be a non-starter.   \sYou don't do genocide cannibalism or BDS. You don't need a law to tell you that this whole Islamist movement against Jews and the Jewish State is totally F-ed up all the way through. Yeah that's messed up. \s\sWhy the hell should a teacher in America need to sign anything about any policy with any other country anyway? What point are they going for there? This is a state law it seems passed by the Republican Governor of Texas. Vote democrats next time I guess?Beto loves Israel more than he loves the United States.Doesn't make a difference. We don't care about those for those goddamn muzziesI guess I'm a bit confused on this one. I read over the article quickly and might have missed it but is the contract saying that she cannot do this in and outside of work? Or just while she is working?\s\sIIRC you don't have freedom of speech at private companies and this could be enforecable but only while she is at work. It's different when you are a government employee. IANAL but that's what I'm under the impression of.\s\sRegardless this is pretty ridiculous that someone should have to make that type of pledge.I think this one confuses a lot of people who aren‚Äôt up to speed on the longer story where being critical of Israel was political suicide 6/7 years ago and it‚Äôs still a dangerous position to take in academics but it‚Äôs getting less so over time. \s\sAlso the popular imagination places antisemitism on the hard right and so can‚Äôt immediately deal with the concept mainstream right that would silence speech critical of Israel Why is everyone attributing this to the ""right"" or the GOP? The article said several Democrat states have similar laws and that Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of NY was one of the first to introduce such a measure. It also implies that none of the 56 Democrats in the Texas lower house voted against the measure (it passed  131-0 in the 150 member House).\s\sAm I the only one here who reads?This couldn‚Äôt be more obviously unconstitutional.

(Onion)Worse???....*or better!!*Fuck. OK thats funny. I just came from another article that $3million had been raised already for Susan Collins opponent in light of Collins voting Yes on Kavanaugh nomination.  First thing I thought of was how easy it would be for a billionaire to just throw money at Collins and allow her to win.  \s\sMoney in politics is the number one problem in the United States and unfortunately those who make the rules are also the ones benefiting from it.  That was well written. Same for Gen X by the way.Second that...nothing more hopeless than growing up during the Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush2 years.Sounds more like we recognize that what we have isn't a democracy rather than that we don't believe in the form of government. It'd be more accurate to say we don't believe the lies about what our system is.[deleted]I was fourteen. :|\sI can't up vote this enough times.yep- it occurred to me a while back that even in Australia neoliberal conservatives and their media bosses have run the country for my entire life.\s\s&#x200B;The media bosses are the same people. Rupert Murdoch is the Australian-turned-American media mogul who heads Newscorp which runs right wing ""news"" organizations in Australia the US and the UK. 1. Defeatist attitude. Does money really buy everything? Then by expanding on that everything is useless because there is allways someone with more money then you on the other side of the argument. The typical argument of people that are not really with the movement and want to destroy it from the inside. ""Why even bother?""\s\s2. Money is used to bribe. To an extend. You know what else is used to bribe? Votes. Media attention. Action. To reduce bribery to money is to reduce war to the act of marching outside of the street to reduce racing to going very fast ect. As usual defeatist attitude of a group destroyer. \s\s3. ""democracy has been dead...."" Then why the fuck are you interested in occupy? I mean really if you want everything to be reduced to ""everything sucks waaah waah let me cry about it"" then why don't you do it inm private? \s\sNow I know this is sounding harsh but here is a counter. I never try to be harsh without giving you a chance to make it better. \s\s1. Discover the joys of single issue voting. I mean we all know the jerkoffs that don't vote. OOH they will tell you about it abnd name their reason but what they are instead saying is  I am holding my vote hostage untill someone entertains me by discussing with me because I am too lazy to do something about it. Usually they will wax and wane about how money actually decides everything and and and. Now here is the trick. IF you know people like this sponsor their vote. Say dude if you go vote I will pay for a beer fior you or if you are richie rich pay for a pizza for them. But only if they would not vote regularely. Then tell them look up on the internet who is the guy who spent the LEAST on electioneering this year? I mean with the campaign sites open it is easy to find out who in your state spent the least ammount of money on the election. GIve the vote to them. In my disctrict in germany we have ONE guy who smells like ass and who allways runs for the legalize weed party. Guess what I got 50 people to do? Vote for this guy. It will be his best election yet. With the might of single issue voting behind you you are able to affect change better then with 50 tumblr posdts about how life sucks. \s\s2. People will try to argue with you. People from all walks of life will mostly use two points of argumentation. One why do you vote when you could participate in the radical process of not voting of showing your discontent by not participating. With this they want you to use your most excellent tool of your vote and make it exactly worth the same as if you were just too lazy to participate. In this case I a strange german from the internet give you my full permission to bitch slap them as long and as hard as they keep talking. You are worth more then nonparticipation. And two they will try tio win you over for their cause. In this case hell maybe they have a point. Maybe they have a bit of info that you haven't had. Maybe they have the miracle candidate that slipped by your field of vision maybe their candidate is on the verge maybe they have an actual game plan. Ask questions try things and who knows maybe you like it. And I am not even going to go on the ""democrat or republican"" bandwagon because I know usually nobody is exactly democrat or exactly republican if they don't know what to vote for. Maybe you have some things you are republican about maybe you have some things that you are democrat about. Maybe god forbid you like some libertarian talking points or even some socialist talking points. The important thing is to know your options andf to stick to it. The third point that is kind of rare but usually propps up in america is the idea that ""a vote for X is a wasted vote because reasons. "" In this case congrats you have found the destroyer of democracy the famed shill wheter it be russian or american paid. You have my full permission to use the fist and make sure to hit them in the reprouductive system so they can't pass on that ammount of malicious stupidity to anybody else. Your vote matters. But it only matters if you can stand 100 % behind your vote. Otherwise what is the difference between you and a schlub that votzes because the one party made better adds then the other? \s\s3. If you actually use violence based on a strange german on the internet giving you permission to do so please do. You already know how this will end. \s\s4. The big part that you have to watch then is for people to come in and co opt your movement. I mean fuck if they make good points that you previously haven't considered please vby all means leave your movement and go over to their movement. Nobody will fault you for reevaluating your point based on new information. However if they come to your movement incvade it with people that all think one way and then use it to ""swing the vote"" to their direction: Tell them very gently that they can do this and then leave. Make a new movement. One that you like. One that you can stand 100 % behind. Wheter it be hardcore republicans invading your movement of environmental protectionism or hardcore democrats invading your single voter group tio turn it towards their party program. Never be afraid to go at it if neccessary all alone. \s\s5. By now you will be ready with ""but what does one vote matter? "" I don't even fault you this you have been trained on this. One a vote makes a difference by showing that there is an other way. If all you have is the option to decide between two flavors of shit you don't really have a vote. But if you go single issue voter and say because I have no candidate that speaks to me I will now vote for the canddiate with the best hair or wearing a green tie a young and upcoming politician that wants something necver before seen or an old geezer that stands for an overlooked point (legalize drugs!) may get the support they need. And even if it is one vote it shows the people that they don't have to if they don't want to. And two you know it probably better then me that certain things demand percentages of the vote. OH 75 % agreement? 50 % to hand in a bill? Guess what every time you don't hand in your vote the percentages needed get better and better abnd are winnable with less and less percentage of the total vote. \s\s6. Politics is beiong sold to you as a quick fix to get your voices heard. It isn't. Instead it is like dieting. THousands may sell you a quick fix an amazing way to get slimmer or to have your voices heard but in actuality the best way is to be active yourself. Give it time. Be consistent. And you will see results. All those amazing changes advertised to you as overnight and totally spontaneous are less truthfull then an instagramm models ""spontaneous"" discoveries. They are the result of long planning great execution and even better spin. Because you will need an election circle to let people know that you are there and what position you have. Say you have the goal to vote for a random candidate who wears state colors on election night. It's an easy fix. Litterally it's only a slight problem for men because women are allowed to wear dresses of all colors. Now. lets say you scooped 20 people together and bounded them behind you. Thus the big party will probably not budge unless it's close. But suirprise the little parties... for them 20 votes that they have for sure is a lot. 20 votes may be all the difference they need between a loss in the election to city council and a win. So a lot of the younger and less popular parties will see this as a quick gain. Nobody else opposes this? Fuck this dress the candidate in neon purple if the offer stands and it looks like they are honest they will come through. And then you get more people and maybe for the next election you back the candidate who is for open sourcing all government software. Or against voting machines. Heck In germany I had local politicians come by my house and hand me a beer just to pick my mind as to what constitutes a ""cyber"" candidate and what we expect off of this. \s\s7. The most important point: The problems the article speaks of are based on a certain predictability. Have you ever heard of the concept of a swing state? OF an indicator state? They will tell you that this is because so and so many people live in this stae thuis if you win this state you are halfway there.... What they don't tell you is that they are playing the system. In the past elections people have made amazing leaps and bounds by playing that system. Obama Trump Bush.... And who could forget hillary drinking herself into a stupor when all her analysts help turned out to not have played the system hard enough? Now tghe most vioolent act of disruption you can levy in a system that is being played is to make the system unpredictable. Decide on a whim. Let a d20 decide who to vote for. Vote for the candidate who wears a tie in your states colors. If enough of you not the ones that can stand 100 % behind a candidate but the ones that would not vote anyways do this you will see results. If your state is close if percentage points matter go rogue. As random as you can. Shake the system up. If you would otherwise not use your vote use it in the most random way possible. The less predictable you are with your voting the less predictable your state becomes. And the less predictable your state is the better the chances that some poor sod thinks to himself fuck this I will run. Not even for senator or a big post but for something as simple as mayor or for city council. And the more of those people are in positions of power the better the likelyhood you will finally find the one canddiate you can stand 100 % behind. And in the meantime it will unbalance the system so much that gaming it will become increasingly difficult. \s\s8. Have fun. I can't stress this enough have fucking fun with politics. Politics is run by old people rush it up. Break with traditions Invent new ones. Let there be discourse. Hand out beer with your political parties logo on it. Argue that you would be ok with drinking cans of beer with the political parties logo on it. Demand that manager wages be tied to bra sizes. Make impossible demands. Get easy answers. Elect a local insane person of renown to city council. Support a candidate who dabs in front of the press. Demand a candidate spanks himself to show kink friendlyness. Or that he should be able to guzzle a can of beer down in one go. And surprise after 2-3 such actions your local voters block is big enough that the major parties are starting to look youir way. AND THEN YOU HAVE THEIR EAR!\s\s9. respect that there are those that will have an opposite opinion of you. that will think your party a joke. Even will try to discredit your voting block. Bear it with respect and quiet dignity because nothing makes those old farts madder then when their usual tactics don't work. With any luck you will be a voting block of young disenfranchised voters. Invite politicians out to the barbeque even if they won't come. Make them local legends. Reserve them a table at the local watering hole. IF they show up the better. After all it's good fuin and it#s better to rock the vote in any way possible then to just sit at home and not vote right? \s\s10. Nothing kills progress faster then just talking about it and taking the chaos out of it. You can sit there for hours just discussing but nothing will get done. And with respect this is when occupy was killed from the inside. Discussed to death. You had the ear of the world you had everyones attention but the more you went into discussions the more things got killed. Mind you not everything. The occupy faction that did not want to bow down to the consensuis but actually wanted to get shit done and buy up morgage debt.... They still exist. And do their thing. The occupy factiobns full of people that have continually resisted every attempt to coopt their movement and actually left the nmainstream once it started conflicting with their goals they still exist. Those people who had enough of talking about change they still exist. Thus a change that is talked about is 1/10th of a change that is actually being done. Activism comes from action and if all the action ios superceeded by talking about it what will remain of the activism? Find your own balance. If you want to talk about it for hours find your own group. If you want to actually do find your own group. If everyone wants to tie your group into a larger network and you can not 100 % stand behind their methods leave. Make a new group. Embrace the chaos. And keep the fun going. You will allways recognise the establishment by the fact that it tries to superceede the fun with talking about it. It will try to take the chaos out of it. Don't let them. Or do if that is your sort of thing. Hey Meistermalkav just a quick heads-up:  \s**neccessary** is actually spelled **necessary**.

I dunno police attacking news crews seems pretty horrific to me. even if the actual injury count is low.[Veterans have been speaking out about the tactics used as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/2djkcv/veterans_mostly_from_iraq_and_afghanistan_comment/) This isnt surprising.

It's something done in France for decades now.Pay attentionExcellent tactics that are working there for the Chinese citizens however here in the States you can be 10000% sure that the Pigs would be opening fire on you.\s\sThey already tackle you beat you cuff you spray you with fire hoses spray you with pepper spray shoot you with rubber bullets use ""crowd control"" vehicles that emit noise that paralyzes/incapacitates you etc. etc. etc.\s\sThere's no way any protesters can make a change here in the U.S. - and that's by design.\s\sThe entirety of U.S. society would have to come together and be ready to truly fight the Cops here in this Country.You really should have a little more respect for police. The only times the police have to intervene in terrifying mobs is when two opposing sides are likely to start mortally wounding each-other roads are being blocked or property is being damaged. That's clearly no bueno. Calling cops pigs is where you should step back and look at the job they are doing its not easy and they don't enjoy breaking into crowds of angry people to stop the ones inciting violence. You can still make a change here in the US through perfectly civil means WITHOUT being shot by rubber bullets.Is anyone else here curious as to why media in the West has put so much emphasis on HK but has damn near willed the Gilet-Jaunes & Standing Rock+Mni Wiconi Movements (+BLM among many others) out of existence? Shit even Occupy seems like a faded memory now and the latest US recession is beyond a burgeoning concern. I'm just confused because I havent seen preferred media coverage anyalized at all in any thread regarding HK. Thoughts?Whenever a foreign country‚Äôs protests get favourable coverage you can be sure it serves the interests of our ruling class.\s\sIn this case they love to see a movement that destabilises China. Various US-front groups like the NED actively fund the protests.*Uses disguise kit*\s\sThis colour revolution is definitely praxis guys!We used some of these technics in france these last months (Gilet Jaune did you heard about it ? We got some really hot moments).\s\sPeoples using technics described in this video are called ""black-blocks"" and it took months for peoples (including GJ) to start understanding they wanted the same thing as GJ not just breaking thing. Yet they are still described by the government and most of the population as ""terrorists"" that are ""attempting to start civil war"" and ""destroy the republic"".\s\sAt each major event like this the methods evolve improve like if peoples are finally learning their power against their own institution. If you can try to grab videos of the Kiev revolution (of around 2015) ; the shit got real there.It fucks me up that people on the far left act as though China is actually a working Communist government and not just an authoritarian regime funnelling profits to the top of the system while it starves enslaves and imprisons its lower classes and dissidents. These protestors are privileged inherently capitalist people. But they're still fighting a monster.[deleted]They reclaim the banner of the USA and of the UK imperialist banners. Whatever China is those protesters are not comrades they are imperialist puppets.I like how the anti-capitalist people ended up buying capitalist propaganda themselves. From which source do you see lower class Chinese people being enslaved? My country has raised more lower class people to middle class than the rest of the world combined and has one of the lowest incarceration rate among developing countries which is 1/6 of what the US is despite having 1/6 as much gdp per capita.\s\sLast weekend there was a massive rally supporting Hong Kong police and local government yet no Western capitalist media seem to cover this.\s\sI like this sub a lot for anti capitalist memes but as soon as the topic goes beyond the US border people suddenly align with people they are supposed to be against. If you haven't been to China before don't assume you have as much knowledge in China as you do in your home countries. In this era of fake news the only trustworthy source is actually be there and see for yourself. Enough said.They're all fascist governments. All of them.Well it's great to see the people winning over the establishment\s\sBut don't fool ourselves this is only possible because the US Empire is not against these protests and it is even very likely that the US is backing these protests\s\sLook on the other hand what about France Honduras and Brazil protests? Yes no media coverage at allThere has been no looting because they are a bunch of wealthy capitalists.They even made sure to vandalize the HK federation of Trade Union workers club.Fighting to be on the wealths side of capitalism (HK) not the the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù (China)Hong Kong is one of THE bastions of finance feudalism and neoliberalism the subreddit fucking hates.  The only revolution I'm supporting in HK is a communist one.I want to applaud their desire for Democracy with a capital-D. Self-determination even as a collective is important to me.\s\sAs a human suffering from high (Though Not Hong Kong high) real estate and education prices? I can relate. I wanna riot too. But this is why we have elections so I'll wait until afterwards.\s\sHow Beijing addresses this will color how I feel about China. Are they the same Tianamen square having nation? Or has something changed? Do I have to wait until 2050 to see China out-America (in the good way) the US? Or is that never gonna happen? Because lets be real - freedom is a lie when you cant afford it. So the US languishes even harder...*[No Church in the Wild intensifies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJt7gNi3Nr4)*I don‚Äôt know when last I‚Äôve felt this impressed about anythinganyone knows how to download videos from reddit?Take notes ladsBlack Bloc tactics are hardly newsImpressive üòÑI love how people don't call them cowards for wearing masks but they do when it comes to antifascists. I wear a mask so psychos like you can't dox me.Having extremely high population density also helpsThe extradition bill was created in response to TAIWAN requesting the extradition of a man who killed his pregnant girlfriend while on holiday in Taiwan.\s\sHong Kong did not have an extradition treaty with Taiwan and so wrote one up that would enable them to extradite people to Taiwan Macau and the mainland (PRC). There were 46 crimes that extradition was approved for. 9 of which were financial crimes and spooked the HK Bourgoisie who have been free to do their worst from HK for decades (because of the Special Administrative Region status). So they organised protests and the financial crimes were removed from the extradition bill. NONE OF THE CRIMES ARE 'POLITICAL'. The only one that I worry about is the abortion one because I'm not fully aware of what abortion access is like in HK PRC Macau or Taiwan.\s\sThe PRC even advised against proceeding with the bill because they knew there would be public backlash.\s\sBut now there was a large anti-PRC/CPC protest movement in HK and the US jumped at the opportunity. The National Endowment of Democracy (soft regime change organisation) has directly funded several of the organisations behind the protests.\s\sThere are 'left' and labour organisations participating in these protests but I find it suspiscious that they seem to be rallying behind this cause (a perfectly reasonable extradition bill) and not the fact that HK has a 20% poverty rate AND THAT THERE ARE WORKERS WHO ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN LITERAL CAGES.\s\sThe PRC is not perfect and I have concerns about it (lack of recourse for citizens who are affected by corruption is a big one) but it was barely related to this bill and reactionaries and imperialists in HK and across the world jumped on it's miniscule connection to create the narrative that this was a ploy by the PRC to take over HK. This is nothing but a beat up to amplify the imperialist narrative that 'CHinA BaD!'\s\sPeople here need to take a step back and analyse these protests because they are not progressive they are reactionary and they serve bourgeois and imperialist interests. If you subscribe to the narrative that China is pushing this bill because they want to take over Hong Kong you are engaging in Orientalism and 'Yellow Peril' and participating in the manufacture of consent for imperialist action against the PRC. You need to adress this.\s\sThere are legitimate criticisms of the PRC this is not one of them. These protestors are inadvertently reactionary and being manipulated by the bourgeoisie and imperialists. These protests match the playbook for a [Colour Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_revolution) perfectly. Hell there is footage of 'protestors' who are armed with American made grenade launchers for fuck's sake.\s\sTo those who are arguing for resisting ""Authoritarianism"" [read Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm). If you think you will ever achieve a revolution free of 'authoritarianism' you are an idealist and you will never get anywhere.\s\sFor those complaining about Tankies [read the China megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/c2b7ma/china_megathread_everything_a_leftist_must_know/). If you still aren't satisfied no worries but if you continue to repeat lies that are debunked in that thread you are actively supporting Imperialism.Guys yall realize they are trying to escape the grips of a COMMUNIST nation right?

Like I understand it can track where people are moving and gathering but aside from that I'm a tad lostSo a heat map could track ""risk"" either at the store level or the city level but both would be a regression model with 2 or more variables. For the store it might be employee diversity total monthly sales (revenue) loss prevention rates. If there is a correlation between employee diversity and unionization then a store manager would be directed to force diversity. Example would be if the employees are mostly white 20 yr olds then the manager may be forced to fire half staff and hire someone from a different demographic. This increases diversity and reduces the chances of employees congregating/planning.\s\sCity would be something they have less control over and simply choose where to open or close depending on the stores tolerance for risk (most likely low).##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism^‚í∂‚ò≠\s___\s###‚ö† Announcements: ‚ö†\s___\s\s###[NEW POSTING GUIDELINES!

Where do these lawmakers think these people will go? Is the hope to lock them up? I can't imagine that will be good for the city's budget. Or do they think they'll just somehow go away?

This is on the level of Thailand or Indonesia.I actually cannot believe it is legal in America. I know Canada has outlawed it and I imagine most of the sane world has as well. As messed up as it is this isn't even a proper application of it.  He's just robbing some dude because he has a badge.Does he just keep the money? What happens next is there anyway of getting it back or is it all just pocketed.Friend of cops family with cops etc. This officer's behavior reflects someone following a rule passed down from higher ups (I may be wrong and he's just doing it on his own) however before downvoting he could easily disobey those orders and not do this if he really wanted to (and his little partner wasn't a taddletail). \s\sThe way he replies to the video recorder mirrors someone's behavior that absolutely knows what he is doing is wrong and is too immature to handle the situation like an adult. His reply when he says ""DID YOU CALL US?"" repeatedly is how people who know they are wrong or have no proper reason for their actions act when in a confrontation. \s\sThis is a red flag when hiring managers supervisors and educators because they can and often will find themselves in a situation where they will be tested by a subordinate and respond like this officer did which can lead to a nasty situation especially if the subordinate has a bone to pick or has the confidence to not back down. \s\sHe is a weak link in the force. His actions and behavior in a situation where he may just be following orders but also found himself in a situation with rising tension shows he cannot control his own emotions and doesn't have the ability to deal with defusing these situations. [deleted]Yeah I don't think laws mean anything anymore except when you're poor or a minority ... which is pretty much most Americans now.Should be any amount... Is it not theft otherwise? SB 443 which was signed by the governor almost a year ago. Might of been sooner but nearly every law enforcement agency lobbied against it.Yeah but I think they meant they still take it until you prove it's yours in courtThe cop said he didn't have a permit and this is law and order. Wow.I'm speechless. The look of defeat on that mans face though.If the cops actually wanted to help they could have given him a warning and told him where to go to get a permit...  Here the cop was essentially mugging him.More devoted to ""order"" than to justice.[deleted][removed]Absolutely disgusting.  The direction I see law enforcement taking in this country is terrifying and I feel so badly for the poor dude selling hot dogs.  What a rough life for us have-nots these days.Welcome to America!When the camera guy was bugging the cop He said Did you call the police on the people drinking?  No. \s\sSomeone called the police on this hot dog vendor.   Some asshole loser calls the police and this guy is fucked.  \s\sSome asshole soccer mom calls the police on a homeless person they get shot to death.\s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tpAZObNZfIAnd don't forget that these same cops now get to arm themselves with military grade weaponry.> and this is law and order.\s\sIn high school they promised that law and order required due process.  I guess not.How he goes through the wallet to check for coins is just fucked.Look the department has been in rough water lately ~~sucking them dry~~ pinching pennies here.He actually looks fucking smug and satisfied as he pulls it out.  Looks like he's trying to hide a smile.Straight into his own pocket that money goes. That is some serious Sheriff of Nottingham shit.\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afvKzAQ-QJY[deleted]Not to mention this happened in Berkeley. If this guy's from the Bay he needs all the money he can get and instead he's having it the money he labored for stolen. And there's nothing he can do about it.It's upsetting to me that you don't realize the cop might ALSO have a wife and family. That's extremely prejudicial and upsetting to me. Don't you like law and order??? Blue lives matter /sThose Mexicans are always the best workers when I lived in the southern US and worked in kitchen you always knew that a Mexican would be the best worker.\s\sYou just have to know kitchen Spanish Man fuck . . . this sub is not good for my blood pressure. > Man fuck . . . this sub is not good for my blood pressure.\s\samen... what a way to wake up this morning seeing this shit.  I instantly raged out and considered what I would do.  And honestly it wouldn't have been pretty for them or for me.Stay angry. Don't ever say 'I'll just except this and play along.'[deleted]Almost definetly chased off the force. Seen it happen many times. If you don't stay in line with rest of the corruption then you will not last long. I don't get why he did that anyway. Non-permitted vendors are the responsibility of the health department not police officers. If we ever need them we have them as escorts or to issue citations. We don't take money (ever) but we will confiscate food or equipment and destroy it.My father has worked in social work for over 35 years in my city. He has created a lot of change with the different organization and committees he has worked with. But his degree was in law enforcement. He became a cop right around the time the war on drugs kicked in. He thought police work would be helping the community. But he soon learned they do more to break down communities. (This stuff also has been studied for decades. Look up the Kansas City report from the 70's and see that scientist could tell police work put a burden on communities.) so my father quickly left the force and spent decades working in social work where he has saved countless lives by helping kids get out of gangs to helping young girls get out of prostitution.\s\shttps://www.policefoundation.org/projects/the-kansas-city-preventive-patrol-experiment/\s\sThe report is called the Kansas City preventive patrol experiment. I was referring to the reports done after that experiment. Essentially in certain areas residence don't feel any safer when police are around. This is because they see them as enforcers. Not people to serve the community. Because yes in inner cities policing is a lot different than say a suburb. People in inner cities don't trust police and don't feel safe when they are around. \s\sAlso another similar study that I forgot the name to looked at how different patrols affect the cops. Having a partner actually causes worst police work. Cops with partners don't notice as much crime because you have someone to kill time with and instead of paying attention as well as he social dynamics of partnership (e.g. Showing off because you have a buddy there.) cops with partners are more likely to be aggressive and feed off the partners actions. Now yes I understand in certain inner cities I wouldn't want to be a cop without backup and I think that they should have a back up. But studies have shown less work gets done and more complaints are filed against cops who don't patrol by themselves.  ‚ÄúThe whole Good Cop / Bad Cop question can be disposed of much more decisively. [‚Ä¶] We need only consider the following:\s\s(1) A cop‚Äôs job is to enforce the laws all of them;\s(2) Many of the laws are manifestly unjust and some are even cruel and wicked;\s(3) Therefore every cop has to agree to act as an enforcer for laws that are manifestly unjust or even cruel and wicked.\s\sThere are no good cops.‚Äù\s\s‚Äî Robert HiggsI'm not an expert but this looks like a super casual robbery.Armed robbery with a good enough prosecutor...Because Police aren't to ""Protect and Serve"" anymore they are there to generate income for the state.For the state?

Both are technically illegal and neither actually is a problem.\s\sHe was acting like there was a mugging in progress that the cops were ignoring in order to take this guy's money.Still waiting for the ""good cops"" to stand up speak in outrage create reforms and clean the trash out of their departments. >Still waiting for the ""good cops"" to stand up speak in outrage create reforms and clean the trash out of their departments.  \s\s...don't hold your breath!Just a few bad apples....They don't speak out against other cops because ""brotherhood"" and other excuses to remain corrupt*crickets*> good cops\s\soxymoronOh no the good cops just do it behind closed doors and help their colleagues bury their messes.There are no good cops.Good cops get run out if they don't fall in line with the corruption.How much time you got?After John Oliver's episode on civil forfeiture I no longer carry cash. Fuck the police.Soon they'll be walking around with a card readerhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJksIn China there are many street vendors like this who would also have their cash taken by the police. So now all the street vendors use Alipay and Wechat pay. It's like apple pay but much better since it's more popular and more useful. This way the cash transactions are greatly limited and there's almost nothing the police can do. Hopefully something like that can happen here too. It's gonna be awesome as more people start banding together to subvert the police and outmaneuver the law because the system has proven itself so grossly unjust as to be irrelevant. Now that's togetherness America.That's actually fucking brilliantThe popularity of Apple Pay doesn't really affect the usability of Apple Pay. As long as a payment terminal accepts tap it will accept Apple Pay. In Australia everyone uses credit and bank cards with tap so everywhere accepts Apple Pay even if they don't have an Apple Pay logo.I hope to see more of that. With all the NFC capabilities phones have nowadays a cashless vendor is best option. Won't get mugged. Won't get the police in his business. Just sell your food man.This poor man. Land of the free where cops are free to do what the fuck they want.üòÇThis puts a human face to what Jeff Sessions and those white supremacists are trying to push through.

Is there any information from the poster that he has about the pig or his partner? I tried to slow down the frame rate and determine badge number or name but my mobile isn't the greatest.  I live in the Berkeley area and as an aspiring law student with enough time to devote into this would love to create both a gofundme for the hardworking gentleman and also fight this illegal use of civil forfeiture. Please reach out with any information you may have. But please PM me. I do not want any information publicized to create more trouble for the vendor. Hey please keep me updated on this. I looked through this thread for info on the vendor too. I went to Cal and it's disgusting to see this happen on campus. I'd love to donate money to help him pay off the ticket and cover his earnings.\s\sEdit: It looks like someone's already set something up and the incident is being ""looked into"": http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/09/10/university-california-police-looking-viral-hot-dog-vendor-video-berkeley/[deleted]I'm not 100% positive but I believe in the state of California you need a criminal conviction for civil forfeiture. Being that you're a law student you could probably find out if that's true easier than I can. If so the thug that stole from the hot dog vendor is named S. Aranas and there's a #76 next to his name (although that's not his badge number). \s\sHopefully that helps. Someone has to stand up to these terrorists. I hate hearing stories about this kind of shit but what makes up for it is knowing that there are people like you out there. It's so easy to become jaded in this world so thank you for spreading the love. Get the UC Regents involved.  They're probably enforcing permitting rules to make sure they comply with their vendor contracts.  What's next? Shutting down kids' lemonade stands? \s\sThese pigs are out of control.It already happens. I may not agree with basically anything posted on this subreddit but the idea that you need a permit to sell things makes it impossible for anybody to start a business unless they're already rich. It's complete bullshit.This sends me into a roller coaster of emotions . None of them good.

Those dangerous hot dog vendors threatening our children with their hot dog selling ways smhThis is why people call cops pigs.It's honestly an insult to actual pigs though to be associated with this piece of shit scumbag thief.I remember my dad told me about his first attempt to cross the border. In 1970 he had been working in a Guatemalan sawmill since age 12 and had saved up 3 grand. Paid a Coyote $300 him and a big group got across and had to walk 20 miles to reach a town where they would go further up. The police caught them took all their money claiming it was drug money and deported them all. His life savings from over a decade of working hard labor gone from this kind of crap.  [removed]Fuck the police.\s\sEverything else I want to type right now is just violent and vulgar so...\s\sJust...\s\sFuck the police.Why couldn't he be warned or asked to leave? Or better yet - issue him a damn permit right there! Public officers should have all the resources they need to help fix a public situation not just be rule nazis. Also what happened to the 4th amendment!?To be fair officers can't issue the permit. To sell food you have to get an inspection from the county (or sometimes state depending on where you live) health department. It's not terribly hard to get a 1 day permit in most places but it can be pricey. \s\sIf they were honestly that worried about him selling without a permit they should have just told him to pack up and leave. That's honestly a fair solution but this was just blatant robbery. [removed]xpost r/anarchismI live in Berkeley. I have seen this cop arrest a homeless person of color and when I confronted him he told me ""You're welcome for keeping the community safe"". Huge fucking asshole. Reported him to the city and got bounced around. I've heard other complaints about him and UCPD just doesn't do anything about it. \sedit: changed BPD to UCPDYou should spread this story locally maybe a little viral magic can shame the dept into taking action. I can't handle the defeated and sad look on that man's face whilst that police worker steals his money in front of him.  He knows if he objects he'll be beaten and thrown into the American prison/slavery system.  This video is so disturbing in so many ways.  I'm sorry for the American people.  I can only hope they stand up together sometime soon.I hate it when they do that top-dawg alpha shit where they tell you to step away even though you're not acting hostile in any way. This is wrong on so many many levels. No permit? Write 'em a ticket don't take money out of his wallet.Based on his face it looks like this man is fully enjoying the american dream.This is essentially theft...they know this guy won't go to court....they just jacked this fool...unreal.this is exactly what cops do all day in places like Thailand and no doubt any feudalist society which most of the third world still is under the guise of democracy. after all police are a recent invention before that they were called tax collectorsNeed the money for the margarita mixer at next week's party[UC Police Sean Aranas Salary last year : $123436.00](http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2015/university-of-california/sean-aranas/)this is probably why theres unprovoked attacks on police these days. this sort of stuff is an ambient provocationEspecially with the smug ""you're welcome. I'm working for you."" Such passive aggressive provocation. ""unprovoked""> ambient provocation\s\sThis is a pretty accurate term for police presence among and action against citizens.Sounds like that Always Sunny episodeHe was gonna jam him up so bad.All cops are bad this is sickening.Forfeiture causes more loss than burglary.\shttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/?utm_term=.98a7848a5375Cop smugly thumbing through pilfered wallet ""Yeah this is Law and Order in action!"".  I can't help but feel that Donald's Trumps thinly veiled racist campaign of ""Law and Order"" is rubbing off on certain officers or more likely simply exacerbating their existing bad behavior.The first issue that seems to be getting less attention is actually the idea that a permit is needed for the guy to even sell hot dogs from his stand wherever that is. The officer is probably 100% correct on that issue and that enables the issue that most people here see as the problem: civil forfeiture. John Oliver has covered civil forfeiture well with this episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks that many of you have seen. So I'll comment about permits:\s\sPermits and licenses are exactly the tool used to keep black brown or who ever is ""undesirable"" from being able to make a dime in ""white"" areas. I've seen this happen in Northern Virginia to go after black people who were selling BBQ just outside of neighborhood. Police showed up and claimed someone called about either a noise or a smell disturbance. I live in Seattle now and on the Fourth of July in South Lake Union there always a bunch of food trucks and tents selling stuff and me and a friend ran into two black guys with delicious BBQ right after our morning run. They told us they knew they'd be kicked out later in the day because of lack of a permit. Folks will say that permits are there to ensure business is being conducted in a reasonable manner (location safety etc). If that was the case it would be cheap and easy as hell to get them and demonstrate just that. However somehow black and brown folks who know how to make delicious food can't even pull that off to make money? If one looks closely into how one business \s or individual gets a permit and another is denied the patterns should become obvious. I wouldn't say all white people get permits and all non-whites get denied but there is enough control to prevent substantially non-white people from selling to white people unless it's under a franchise owned by a white person (McDonalds Burger King etc).\s\sPermits were and are still used to try to legislate protests. Any business area in middle or upper middle class neighborhoods have regulations on public demonstrations. The moment someone wants to show up to protest something about what a business is doing the police can come and arrest them for not having a permit. The same shit was used against Martin Luther King Jr. and he openly ignored it and was arrested multiple times. These permits in theory are there to ensure certain locations stay ""peaceful"" and void of the complaints from people that are being screwed over by the same system that protects that peace.[removed]Robbery under color of law.I hope this guy gets hung high and dry. Have no clue of context but I have a hard time believing that Latino deserved to have his wallet emptied. That is like some of the backwater Central to Western Kansas cops that drain people dry under false pretense of drug running. Did that evidence ever even see a police station or did he just split it with his partner right there? Big man bike cop hiding behind a badge. Is this even legal that a police open your wallet and steal the money inside??The police are civil servants the right thing to do would be to explain what he's did wrong and give him a warning and fine him if he doesn't listen the next time!\s\sSo much for America being the land of the free No difference than some third world banana republic. What a sociopathic asshole that 'officer of the law' is. \s\sIs there a GoFundMe or similar page to help out the vendor?Rough translation from the seller:\s\s> Why is he taking my money? Someone ask him.\s\s>Why is he going to take away my money?\s\s(Directed at what I assume is the filmer):\s> He is taking my money away please ask him why. \s\sLater on he asks him who is keeping the money and the officer points a finger at himself. \s\sIf this was in Mexico this would be classified as a typical mafia/cartel style extortion in which they ""Collect"" a large sum for ""Protection"". A ""Non-voluntary"" bribe if you will. And yes it can be done by ""Policemen"" altho it is considered illegal. ACAB!Looks like armed robbery if ive ever seen it.

Honestly the moment some shitass bike cop starts demanding my money I'd start tearing it up out of spite.\s\sIf he wants my money he'll have to bend over to pick it up and submit it to the treasury for re-distribution.

Our rights and our freedom guaranteed to us as citizens of this ""country"" are being wiped away very slowly by the ones that are supposed to protect and serve us.

Every time I see something like this I wonder what happened to ""to serve de protect""?\s\sYeah I know ""to serve and protect the rich"" but it doesn't have to be this way. :(Why the fuck are people still going to America?[removed]If you want to add some fuel to the fire that's gonna burn under this officer's ass because what he did was actually Illegal under SB 443 in the State of California here is something you can sign (hopefully) to get some action done.\s\shttp://www.thepetitionsite.com/992/821/972/remove-s.-aranas-76-from-university-of-california-police-department/Wow I don't see anything like this ever happen in Holland. But I still feel rage for the people from the us. Breaks my heart how corrupt all these cops areI don't live in America but if someone can find out who that hombre is I'll send him a couple of dineros. Goddammit man!Cop is a giant asshole. Just enforcing food permit law.Hey!  It's a democracy man!  Cops who suspect citizens of wrong doing can take their stuff.  (That's sarcasm by the way ... if you have a police force able to do this shit you're in anything but a democracy.)That's some Dennis Reynolds shit right there. Insert sunny reference Captain Jack Bauer etc.\s\sI'M WALKING!!Nice shorts and bike helmet judge dread... Fuckin ass hole I plan on becoming a state police officer as a lot of my family is and this shit makes me sick I know very well you don't NEED to do shit like this.Douchebag wasn't even sorry. Think he's in the right. Sickening.WTFcivil forfeiture the law that keep giving to the rich and corrupt. While the poor keep on suffering injustice even when they work so hard to succeed. To those rich and elites fucker who said that poor people are lazy and that why they are poor. Fuxk you and yes you deserve to die and I hope you burn in hell. \s\sEdit: ""that how it work "" and ""critical thinking"" that statements really stuck on me. How what work ? When something is made into law doesn't made it right especially when that law is not to serve all but the few by twisting moral logic and public sentiment . So much for critical thinking when other more severe crimes probably happening somewhere time is better spend ceasing this hardworking men money  than going after those kinds of crime. I can only hope the officer gets the same treatment in life some how. The law is there but one must choose what to apply.ACABIn America this is common and happens everyday.\s\sLaw enforcement officials walk up to random members of the public and demand their wallets.\s\sThen they take there money. If you resist you are shot on sight.\s\sJust thank your lucky stars when you remember that you dont have to live in this country.This was armed robbery by two government sanctioned mafia members for the sole intent of stealing cash.\s\sWhere are our 2A ppl to defend muggings like this when you need them?\s\sOr I guess this is perfectly okay since the thugs are white and the victim is not?\s\sI would love to see the races (only) reversed and the public response from that!Don't know if this is posted here somewhere yet . . .\s\shttps://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/06/13/18650576.php\s\sFrom 7 years ago about same cop.[removed]That's the type of cop that LOVES getting tough on the helpless.  He's getting off on that.\s\sUC Berkeley police is just fundraising by targeting the cash from people who don't have lawyers.\s\sIt takes a very special person to come up with that type of monetization program.Its so clear that the cop does not even feel bad at all.Anyone know where we can locate the hot dog guy? His look of defeat and confusion is so sad. I want to set up a go fund me for himThis ruined my day; I'm so sad. I want to send that vendor money. The police state dystopia is already here. I‚Äôm usually all for the content in this sub but food vendors should probably have a permit. I can't even bring myself to watch this video of a man being robbed of the money he will use to feed his family and continue business by official slated by any government. SadLand of the free. Go see Jim Jeffries' skit about American freedom. \s\s""In holland you can fuck a prostitute and look at a cop in the eye and not get arrested. Don't tell me you guys are free""\s\sEye opener that one [removed]We live in a capitalist society. The police are the armed enforcers of the state. Anti-capitalism doesn't simply mean opposing property and whatnot it means opposing the tyranny of a state that keeps capitalism running.You know capitalism has gotten bad when a state agent can just come along and take a man's money simply because he didn't have a permit from the government to sell hot dogs. Fuck the free market man.[removed]Since when has capitalism ever had anything to do with a free market? From what I can tell capitalism has always been about making a set of rules that are then enforced to allow the market to function in the first place then bending the rules to their breaking point to ensure that they always favor those in power.>  Late stage capitalism? Or too big of government?\s\sLate stage capitalism to the point of rich people controling the government and not enforcing the constitution. \s\sThis is not a problem about the government being ""too big"". This is a problem about the government shitting on the constitution. ""this is how it works"" WTFthis is how it works. his infraction will take sales away from businesses that pay for the right to be there. Those businesses have standards and inspections they (small restaurants including food trucks) are part of a vibrant culture kept alive in the bay area. A culture that is directly harmed when people sell food without obeying the standards having the inspections so on so forth. It is part of the cost of making money as a restaurant. When you make illegal gains without a permit those gains are taken in this case held for trial. People drinking in public is not only irrelevant but as was pointed out not reported on. He got a call he's on that call when he's off that call he'll go to the next one. This is exactly how it works how it should work how you and I pay them to work. Do you have an alternate system that keeps people safe buying food in the city of berkeley without health inspections? Would you like to get food poisoning and be told to fuck off by the restaurant? Do you prefer people die from that shellfish brain disease and there be no way to track where it came from and prevent more deaths?\s\sDoes nobody understand that systems look ugly if you stare at the ugly part?The dude is selling food in public without a permit. There are regulations for a reason. Yeah. Taking that guy's money sure addressed the problem behind selling food without a permit üôÑI get the entire ""safe food regulation"" thing but lets be fair - if I'm buying food from a cart I myself am taking on an assumed amount of reasonable risk. Basically the same thing if I'm eating at a cookout at someone's house. \s\sI don't need a thorough health inspection just a reasonable expectation of cleanliness; like the person serving the food hasn't rolled the edibles on the ground or something.\s\sEdit: A word.[removed]I see you convientiently left putbthe whole robbery part?\s\sNo good thin blue line argument to literally go in the public's wallet and take what you Can?\s\sProsecutorial discretion is the cornerstone of police abuse.""No choice"" = choosing to be a shit human for a paycheck. And considering what a cop gets paid he's got a low price for garbage behavior. I am entirely willing to help replace that money right now and this power-mad badge hiding behind his gun should be on desk duty indefinitely if not forced to resign. This is why so many good cops get a bad name. Didn't have a permit? Ok I get it he should have a permit but he's selling hotdogs not cocaine.It's lawyer time. I get the feeling civil forfeiture lawsuits against police departments are going to ring a strong message to cut this kind of police activity. Instead they should just have some type of way to have him get a permit right then or stop selling hotdogs. Civil forfeiture is a problem that really needs looked at and fixed.This is fucked upI feel like Reddit has the power to contact this guys and set up a go fund me so he can actually get a permit and some extra money to run the buisness wellThat's not right man. That's not right.Fuckin bullshitWell that was heartbreakingcant they just tell him to leave? not take his fucking money. and god damn i love those hot dogs man they're so good.Does any one have any information about how we can reach the hotdog vendor? I'd love to be able to donate something to this man. The look on his face just breaks my heart.Nevermind found the GoFundme page: https://www.gofundme.com/officialjustice4juanstreetvendorsThat poor mans face. Terrible üôÅI see what's happening but i would like some context as to not just assume and jump on the bandwagon.So real cops have reached the level of The Golden God himself? What's next enforcing the implication?Also that dickhole of a cop. When a crime is being reported to him directly ""did you call us? Did you call us? You didn't call us okay thank you"" \s\sLike what the actual fuck he's informing you in that instance of a crime and your response is you didn't contact us through the correct channels so the crime will go unanswered. That guy is such a smug fucking prick. Now I'm all angry and shit. FuckpoopThe cop should tell the man exactly what he's doing when he's doing it.   There is no due process here at all.   Fucking bullshit. Land of the free and the home of the bravemakes me so sad this man is just trying to survive The look on that guys face makes me wanna cry. The look on his face :( he never gonna forget this.Really though the more police abuse this the sooner something would be done about it.The lack of self awareness here that this is about lack of government mandated permits and government shutting down a free market is the most astounding part. Keep cheering this sort of thing on by the continued fight for even more regulations.""Law and order?"" I feel like this is a case where the cop could have had just a little compassion for human integrity and turned his head(never saw it happen). He's not out there swinging dangerous drugs or firearms to the public to make money. He's making a SMALL amount of cash to take care of himself and his family (my assumption) serving HOT DOGS to willing buyers. What a horrible crime! \s\sI'm sure there were plenty of other crimes going on the officer could have been trying to prevent rather than take this poor mans small amount of cash he worked for. It's just sad to see this kind of stuff. When you see tons of huge corporations doing much worse dirty business and illegal activities and getting away with it only because they have the cash flow to pay off whoever they need to wipe it clean.\s\sThere are far too many laws and regulations in this country that are so flawed it's sickening. To target a poor man on the streets just trying to survive and make paths meet is just pure evilness. If anything steer him in the right direction. Help educate him of these lame ""laws and regulations"" he was unknowingly breaking. Guide him on the steps to get a permit and sell food legally. Not take the cash he earned so he can't even afford to begin the purchasing permit steps. The cop could have shown a little heart in this situation. This is bs. The officer is basically legally robing a fucking hot dog vendor A C A FUCKING BThat's not civil anything that's a shake-down.>to Protect and Serve\s\syeah.WELL DONE Officer Bacon. Great job keeping that filthy criminal off the streets. I hope you sleep well knowing scum like him must go hungry.\s\sI'll also point out this fucking thief with a badge effectively robbed the vendor twice. Once in cash once in the stock sold to generate the cash.It's like I always say: cops are dicks. Fuck the policeI'm sure the vendor's race was the issue I find it hard to believe if that were a white person that would have happened Isn't this the shit 2nd amendment nutjobs use to justify carrying arsenals at home? Government overreach and theft of property? Or is that only for white folks... \s\sIdk maybe they're up to something. Maybe the police need to be reminded that they serve the public not the other way around.I assume the video ends when the officer leaves to go bust up a 9-year-old's lemonade stand. That's nice. Must be great living in the land of the free where the police rob you so the crimimnals won't. thats your taxdollars at work right there.. bullshitGlorified mall cop...it's the highlight of his careerHe's the kind of hero who buys  blue line-american flag merch like bumper stickers t-shirts and coffee mugs\sS\s Seriously issue a ticket for selling without a permit and explain to him the nature of the violation and how he can acquire a permit.  If he is living illegally in the US I'm not sure if a permit would be offered to him.  There has to be a means for an individual who wants to work and is providing a genuine service for the community to continue to provide for himself and family.\s\sThere is no reason to go into this guys wallet and steal (literally) X amount of money in the name of justice.  How are we as a nation supposed to be justified in cracking down on hot dog vendors instead of focusing all efforts on violent and destructive criminal activity.\s\sSadly there are likely thousands of officers in similar roles nationwide executing similarly unjust seizures. So the police just up and robbed him. Glad my tax dollars are being spent on taking down these terrible criminals and making the streets safer..... SMH.Cops protect and serve property not people. Pigs are pigs.[Link to petition to have the Officer removed from UC Police](http://thepetitionsite.com/992/821/972/remove-s.-aranas-76-from-university-of-california-police-department/?taf_id=42211857&cid=fb_na#bbfb=716735099)\s\s(sorry if someone's already posted this.

You should work for ICE dude you've got a serious skill.things like this are why bitcoin will stick around.It's kind of ironic this would be popular in this sub. I kind of expected people approving of the cop. \sBut here I am in a leftist sub and people are actually in favor of a guy having the right to his property. And against the unlawful confiscation of said property. What the fuck is happening.Injustice isn't a partisan issue. Grow up.Worst thing is that the cop seems like a total jerk..guy selling hot dogs seems very nice..this is so sad[deleted]Not sure I understand the question. Perhaps in order to elucidate where you are coming from you could give us an example of a capitalist economy that has ever existed in which dominant businesses *don't* have laws made in order to restrict and hobble their competition?Imo just because it speaks to the greed of capitalism. Stealing money from the people you're supposed to protect.Ok I don't even think this is a 'capitalism is bad'-thing specifically this is just a 'US is getting ridiculous' thing. No country governed by the rule of law would or should stand for this no matter their economic system.\s\sThe fact that this is allowed to go on in the US is symptomatic of a fundamental breakdown of the social structure[removed]Well... this seems legit. He took a gamble hoped noone would check his credentials. On the flip side if he sold something and someone got food poisoning and died he could pack up shop and be gone with the wind. Gamble you take buying food off a vendor who is gambling on his license.Disgusting he needs his face brokenWhy the fuck is a bike cops checking for a permit?! Isn't the health set or code enforcement supposed to do this?! Total bullshitWHY do people like this get to be cops in America??? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR COUNTRY HOLY SHIT.\sSomeone post this man's facebook account or something.This has absolutely nothing to do with capitalism.[removed]they are implying that these laws are in place because corporations have lobbied the government to fuck small business\s\sor at least that is my best guessWhat the fuck does this have to do with capitalism?Cops are the protectors of the bourgeoisie.  That's what it has to do with capitalism.  Plus capitalism created the playground for this pig to steal from citizens.  Don't breed your centipede nonsense in here child.   Disagree with the civil forfeiture but dude should've had a permit. Why does he get to run a business without paying for the proper permits/taxes ?I'm against civil forfeitures just as much as anybody else but this case is different. The guy is operating a business without a permit not to mention selling food without 1. Everyone is quick to stand up for this vendor but be careful what you wish for. If things like this aren't enforced then you basically get Southern Europe where everyone works under the table and the government is on the edge of bankruptcy. This guy is basically stealing from all tax payers and if he isn't then he'll have his opportunity in court to get his money back. There is no difference between this guy and a friendly drug dealer and if the dealers funds were confiscated then nobody would bat an eye lash. But this is anti capitalist. A free market would have no restriction against hot dog vendorsIt's a hotdog cart.  Not a donut cart.  I don't see why he stopped him.  \s\sHotdogs look good too.   Look properly grilled.  I'd buy that for a dollar!deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9397  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/22710)To hear a different side: I used to work in law enforcement.  We did something call ""till taps"". If someone owed money the debtor could go to court and get an order.  If the person owing money owned a business that did cash transactions the order could be converted to a ""till tap"".   Which means that someone (me) would go to the business just before their busiest period if known. For instance this guy probably does booming lunch business so I would arrive around 10:30 to observe that all cash goes into a certain spot. Without the owner knowing.  Then when the busy time appears to end we come in with uniformed officers and take the till.  Basically we take all cash on the premises to pay the debt owed. If it is a business with multiple sites we go to all sites the same day.  If there are two parts (bar/restaurant) we call all employess into a main area and take both tills.\s\sFairly rare but not uncommon.\s\sSo off camera perhaps since the shot is VERY tight there may be a person like I was standing there with the court order.That sounds corrupt as fuck""You wanna get jammed up?""What‚Äôs going on can someone explain whats happening here?Please tell me this ended in a good way. Cause that's  fucked upNot sure how this applies to this sub as it is the government forcing someone out of the free market for not giving the government a piece of their laborWhat state/town is this in?/r/Libertarian would love this too. Another fine example of government theft. But thankfully these fine police officers do it to protect and serve us.\s\sNot like there is actual crime to be investigated: https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/berkeley/crimeITT: A bunch of literal liberals clutching their pearls patting a pig on the back.  \s\sDon't you people know that cops are part of capitalism!? They protect capital  now they steal it.   Eli5 please?Billy rob Thornton.Fuck that cop w/ a bullet. Can someone find the hot dog vendor's info and start a GoFundMe for the poor guy? This story needs to pick up speed.This makes me so angry.  Next time get the police officers badge number and ask who his commanding officer is.  At least ask for it on camera.  You have a right to verify that he is an actual police officer and not just some thief with a badge.  If these people start getting their names made public and their commanding officers get some heat maybe they will start protecting the people and not rob them.  \s\sI understand informing the guy he needs a permit and to get off campus until he does but this is infuriating to watch.its Californiathey are the hypocrites of the republic \sOne day they welcome illegals the next there are \ssteeling thier moneys . I generally have a shit load of respect for the cops but god damn just leave this guy alone. He's working hard for his money I can't imagine rolling a hotdog cart around the city all day for probably minimum profits. See it's cops like this that can't just let the easy shit pass that I don't like.Hey when your done with him there's a 5 yr old down the street with a lemonade stand I saw a jar of quarters. I bet this same douche would let a judge drive away drunk as shit! Or judges son/daughter what a dirt bag!!My concern here is that this man might become so successful that he has to hire people at minimum wage to help him with his business. Then he would just be a greedy capitalist.""Law and order"" jesus fucken Christ. He is selling hot dogs! What's the most that little stand could costa couple of hundred dollars? If this vendor had a go fund me I would definitely give.You know what blows my mind? Is that they‚Äôve raised $32000 in just one day for this guy. That blows my mind. Like all these random people just came together and did that. Anyways [here‚Äôs](https://www.gofundme.com/officialjustice4juanstreetvendors) a link to the GoFundMe. All benefits go to ‚Äúthe vendor‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonal legal and professional matters.‚Äù Flores (the man recording) said all the money raised will go to help ‚ÄúJuan‚Äù and¬†‚Äúto cover other vendors who have been robbed of their hard earned living through citations and removal of their carts.‚Äù\s\s\s[Source](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/09/10/university-california-police-looking-viral-hot-dog-vendor-video-berkeley/)The argument of the bystander is really fucking weak though ""there are other people doing illegal stuff too"". Still shoot the pigs.America would be a safer place if the police were killed on sight. He doesn't even know how much of the money he took came from hot dog stand profits.##Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism^‚í∂‚ò≠\s___\s###‚ö† Announcements: ‚ö†\s___\s\s###[NEW POSTING GUIDELINES!

A 2006 hailstorm in Indiana resulted in 50000 claims being filed with the insurer. State Farm wasn't happy with the uptick in business which resulted in hundreds of complaints being filed against the insurer with the state's Department of Insurance.\s\s>From all appearances the insurer decided to scapegoat Joe Radcliff a contractor who was very busy performing hail damage inspections. Two years after the hailstorm police arrested Radcliff telling him he was being charged with 14 felonies.\s\s>The insurance company accused Radcliff of deliberately damaging shingles and siding presumably in hopes of being hired to repair the damage once the insurance check came in. After losing almost all of his customers over the bad press Radcliff found out State Farm was behind the criminal investigation. The railroading began in earnest one year prior to his arrest shortly after he spoke to a TV reporter about State Farm's foot-dragging.\s\s>State Farm went after Radcliff's customers to try to build its case‚Ä¶ but not by asking them if they'd noticed any possible criminal activity. **No State Farm TOLD them they had observed criminal activity and that it would fuck them up too if they refused to help put the contractor away.**#Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism^‚í∂‚ò≠\s***\s\s#***Please remember that LSC is a SAFE SPACE for socialist discussion.***\s\s**Any posts or comments not conducive to the above will be removed and may result in a ban.

Why? Because long ago they decided to put people first and so they used $500 billion dollars in productivity  to improve the lives of their employees and the communities they live in.\s\sHalf a billion dollars = $883392 for every single one of Amazon's employees. Let's round that down a bit and just say that every single Amazon employee gets an extra $25000/year on top of their current salary for a thirty year career. The leftover billions of dollars can go towards something else. Scholarships parks whatever.\s\sWhat would that reality look like?\s\sAmazon would be one of the most widely cherished companies in the United States.\s\sAll the best talent from grunt labor to executive level would be lining up to work there improving productivity of the company even more.\s\sJeff Bezos would be a man of the people. A literal hero.\s\sWith the immense popularity of the company and its leadership sales would likely be even higher than they are today.\s\sMr. Bezos himself and the executive levels of the company would still be filthy rich beyond belief.\s\sThe example would have been set for the competition and for corporate culture in the US as a whole. Wages would rise communities would strengthen and less people would be dying prematurely from living shit lives in or near the gutter.\s\sIn a nutshell it would be the 1950's all over again. Everything about living in this country would be improved tenfold overnight.\s\sI just don't understand why nobody does this not even on a much smaller scale. When you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars as an individual who gives a fuck about money anymore? Why not use your achievement to literally change the world for the better at a human level?It's a nice thought but we have reached the point of hyper-capitalism where money correspond with social status for these upper class people. The more of it they have the higher their ""score"" is and since money forms their entire sense of self-worth they will just continue to stockpile it in the future.> I just don't understand why nobody does this not even on a much smaller scale. \s\sBecause they would personally have less. That's why. Pure unadulterated Narcissism. That's not how market cap works. The $500 billion you're slicing off to go to the workers doesn't actually exist. \s\sThe $1 trillion valuation doesn't mean that the company has $1 trillion in cash - it means that if you add up the value of all of the outstanding shares of stock the company as a whole is *worth* $1 trillion. And that's factoring in future estimated revenue and growth not just current assets on the books.\s\sYou'd need to raise $500 billion to buy out those shares in order to cash out that $500 billion. \sI agree and this is why I've boycotted Amazon.

If Amazon's employees actually had a choice they wouldn't work these low paying jobs. The truth is they don't have a choice and when you are forced to work like this it's just slavery with extra steps.\s\sWe are all Wage Slaves in America. Slavery was never outlawed here no it was just regulated and rebranded as ""capitalism"". Actually it was rebranded to prison work force... This is some pure grade A horseshit right here.  Well said horseshit but horseshit.And if they increase the wages of workers the stock price drops because paying people a living wage is bad business according to Wall Street. Well due to Dodge v.

Now you should stop and think about that.What's boggling is people thinking this is going to change.\s\sIf it didn't work with Walmart then companies coming up similar are going to do the same thing because they can.\s\sWhile I hope real change actually does happen one day just slapping a $15 an hour price tag on these jobs doesn't really fix anything.\s\sIf you were to tell me that Walmart was paying stockers $15 an hour then I'd quit both of my jobs paying more and do so much less work and do that.  At least I'd get to work in the AC all day and not doing heavy manual labor on my weekend job.It does not change because people hate each other.\s\sI give you the world.\sThe truth is that Amazon as a public company whose worth is estimated to 1 Trillion USD is very optimistically overpriced by the investors as it's PER is 176 at this time (meaning that if Amazon would distribute ALL of its profits to the shareholders each year they would have to wait 176 years to get their invested money back).\s\sFrom my perspective Amazon has a bad business model which relies on cheap labor if it was to increase the wages of the lowest paid employees it would go bankrupt in no time (also meaning that those people will become unemployed so I guess it's a matter of view: do you prefer people to have nothing at all and keep their dignity or have a little of something but no dignity?)Amazon isn‚Äôt profitable without their tech counterpart which are immensely profitable. The labor and retail part to me are like a low wage jobs program at this point that barely makes any profit.If it wasn‚Äôt for food stamps Amazon would still be worth a trillion dollars and it‚Äôs workers would be starving. The existence of food stamps doesn‚Äôt really subsidize them much because they don‚Äôt care about their workers. Uhm but Amazon wouldn‚Äôt then have their labor without which they wouldn‚Äôt get any work done.Uu""According to a 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office more than 23000 active-duty troops used the food stamp program in 2013 the last year for which such information was available.""\s\sHey Bernie can the military get paid more too?\s\sI mean they hire about 3x as many people as Amazon so they must be a bigger monopsonyHe advocates a smaller military/military budget overall.Amazon pays its IT workers pretty well. And there are a lot of IT workers so it is isn't just a couple of manager types that are making good money. \s\shttps://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Amazon-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E6036_D_KO724.htm\s\sAmazon pays its warehouse workers a lot less. But the skills needed to work in a warehouse is a lot easier to find than the skills needed to work in IT.  So the salary differential isn't that unusual.  The IT guys can make bank. A friend of mine has worked there almost eight years since college his Seattle house is paid for by AMZN stock sales.American workers are wage slaves and value is assigned by skill level only. Not unusual is a odd way to put it. \s\sWhat a horrible world. Everyone suffers at the bottom. They should get stabby.\sWhat a joke Walmart employs like 4x as many people...\s\sEDIT: It's a joke that Amazon is seen as a monopsony for labor when labor is the one with the choice on whom to offer their labor to. That's actually an important point to make even though Walmart is a patron saint of wage stagnation and is guilty of much the same. Amazon has no incentive to hire nearly as many people compared to the brick and mortar stores they displace.Walmart employs more people therefore people who work at Amazon on food stamps are a joke? What are you saying?It‚Äôs simple: the establishment has gotten to the point of considering its political rivals as enemies of the state."

Obviously they‚Äôre going To run things by the DOJ and let them put a statement out about the story or deny it but the gov cannot tell them what they can or cannot publish.[deleted]Have you read the article? Because this is about handing editorial control to government agencies not cultivating sources.\s\sEven if it were if maintaining a relationship with a source means giving them veto power over your reporting only a truly shitty reporter would make that trade.The way news works in liberal democracies is through cultivating a good relationship with the powers at be in order to get access to leaks and scoops. And as this article points out the media shares their articles with the government to discuss security concerns  \s\s\sWhat this does is develop a dependency relationship between the media and the government which means the media is incentivized to self-censor question sources less and publish news favorable to the mainstream liberal capitalist line (such as the Washington Consensus line) in order to keep getting access to the scoops. Furthermore the general structure of how a news business is run means that the low to medium level employees are going to try and curry favor with the high level employees and the bosses in the company in order to advance their career and this process of currying favor acts as a selection mechanism so that the people who do advance in their news careers are the ones who believe in or at least are willing to toe the line. The most flagrant example of that is the leadup to the Iraq war where the Bush administration was easily able to manipulate most major news outlets to set up a case for the invasion of Iraq even though a minuscule amount of digging would have found that all of the pro-Iraq invasion pieces of evidence were all coming from the white house. This tactic has been repeated throughout liberal capitalist history.  \s\s\sLong story short the way that news media works under a liberal democracy acts as a propaganda machine but instead of working through a heavy handed censorship model it works through intensives dependency and self-censorship.   \s\s\s[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVzvlKrYWaQ&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVzvlKrYWaQ&t=2s)

It's only been in the foundation of our country since it's inception right??\s\sSeriously though: The suspension of habeas corpus would be really really bad and unfortunately I doubt most Americans could even tell you what it was if you asked them let alone what could happen if it were to be suspended.What is it?This is literally the thing that has terrified me the most. \s\sAnd the fact that I am seeing zero coverage of this on The Box. If this passes the US will literally be able to be China and just have mass arrests and put people into camps.  \s\sAnd if you think Trump wouldn't do that in a second........\s\sIf this gets passed.

This act gave Hitler's cabinet the power to decree laws without being passed by the Reichstag‚Äîeffectively giving Hitler dictatorial powers. Leaving nothing to chance the Nazis did not even count the arrested KPD deputies for the purposes of determining a quorum. They also used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to detain several SPD deputies. Many others fled into exile. All of this ensured that it would pass with over 85 percent of the deputies who were present and voting far more than the two-thirds majority required in the constitution. As it turned out the session took place in such an intimidating atmosphere that the Enabling Act would have garnered the required supermajority even if all KPD and SPD deputies had been present.Let no good crisis go to waste.[removed][deleted]Maybe this virus will make Americans uncomfortable enough that they actually do something about their corrupt government.[deleted]Let's hopeGod willing.Except Sanders who had the good sense to stay the hell away from congress in recent days and fundraise for charity instead.lol no chanceEveryone who hasn't yet needs to go read the classic book [The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine).

But yet I'm still under the microscope due to me using Reddit for some meager semblance of a social life that I lack and cannot regain.I live in a South American city that purchased Chinese surveillance technology and has cameras at every intersection in my neighborhood. I learned last year that my front door and 3 or so meters each side of it are in a blind spot and I was inexplicably relieved. The cop who told me was looking for footage of a robbery in front of my house and kind of apologized that none existed. Like I was somehow being let down by a lack of thoroughness on their part. Strange days.Certainly supported by technological fanaticism and little to no regulation at this point and also no laws over here.

Read the headline and thought it was just another one of those absurd proposals we see from time to time that never go anywhere.\s\sAre we sure there wasn't a provision to install kill switches around our necks hidden away in there too?I think this has been twisted a bit.

""Oh they'll only use the kill switch to stop pursuits and car thieves.""My personal conspiracy theory which I've held for a long time: car-dependence has been used as a means of control by law enforcement.

Via VIN tied to plate?\s\sThis seems like a crazy idea.""It's 5:00pm and I'm ready to get home. Fuck it everyone on this overcrowded highway is getting killswitched!"" *Turns on sirens and proceeds to destination*Realistically it would have to be VIN tied to a plate. Then they'd have to call the manufacturer most likely to have them shut it down. Which would probably take a while. That would only work if the plate matched the car though.VIN is on the registration and accessible from typing the plate number into the onboard computer in the police carThis may be purely a rumor but I‚Äôve heard that cars have terrible security.  Like the key fobs to unlock a car are notoriously easy to hack.\s\sAutomobile manufacturers just aren‚Äôt known for sophisticated IT.  Hell the dashboard UIs are always notoriously out dated even in my 2015 Mazda.  Those kinds of features are implemented as cheaply as possible as buyers don‚Äôt discriminate on those qualities.\s\sLack of experience in the industry + a feature no one wants = happy fun times?  I mean what could go wrong?Oh yeah it'll be major play time for the black hat brigade I'm sure.I will be fighting this vehemently.They'll just make removing the kill switch illegal. There's precedent for that: Destroying or altering tracking beacons installed by the FBI can get one charged with ""destruction of government property"".\s\sThey can just do the same with the switch or just claim that any vehicle without it is ""unsafe"" and not road-worthy.Would be interesting to see exactly how police get the ability to open your car and if there are any safety measures involved.\s\sYou still ‚Äútechnically‚Äù have to consent to your car being searched or probable caused must be stated. Could potentially open the door to cops having to log their reasoning ahead of time and requesting a warrant from a judge prior to a search. \s\sInteresting idea to play with but it won‚Äôt ever happen.\s\sThe kill switches would eventually malfunction and kill other people during non emergency situations. Imagine driving your car on the highway and the fucker just comes to a full stop because you can‚Äôt afford to fix it. 3 car pile up. The technology won‚Äôt be there for a long timeIt's not going to be a ""kill switch"" per se; more likely an ""AI just took over your car"" switch. Think about all the automated features on cars over the past few years - full self driving ""autopilot"" automatic braking adaptive cruise control push-button parallel parking. Your car won't shut off on the highway at 80mph - the flashers will come on it will begin decelerating and begin changing lanes stopping in the shoulder. The technology is already in many (most?) new carsCops show every time:\s\s\>Do you consent to being searched?\s\s\>No.\s\s\>So the dog searches you then... dog gestured at me so that's sufficient cause for me to detain you and bust everything open without your consent.\s\s\>(Camera shuffles around) Looks like we've *found* some meth in here he'll be going away for that and we're gonna impound this vehicle.They already have this capability. Emissions testing where I live is nothing more than a review of your ECU you would have to interface with your cars platform and edit it and they will make that illegal.  Unenforceable but illegal.Don't buy those cars. Problem solvedAnd if they put them in all of them?Time to go back to horsesWell I won‚Äôt be able to afford a car made in 2026 until 2040 anyway.

First they started spying on our phone calls our Internet usage and our private affairs. Then corporations started to spy on our homes with Alexa and other smart devices and Google tracking our movement wherever we go. Now we won't be able to drive post-2022 without Amazon or the government or a hacker snooping in on our affairs and being able to stop our vehicles without our consent (not like we haven't been lulled into becoming dependent on automobiles anyways in our car-dependent culture or into using fossil fuels regardless of the consequences).\s\sWe're already living in an authoritarian nightmare dystopia enslaved by large institutions both corporate and governmental but most people are either blind living in denial or simply accepting the status quo rather than fighting to change it. And America is effectively already a corporate fascist state in all but name. The kill switch bill after the likely reversal of Roe vs. Wade is simply the next step to the nation's inevitable descent into tyranny and oppression. Both political parties that currently exist in the US are already neck deep in authoritarianism just in different flavors yet accuse the other side of what they themselves have already become or are slowly becoming (pick your poison-- would you rather want an Orwellian cancel culture/social justice police state or a neo-fascist white supremacist theocratic/Christian police state? Or just your standard corporatist state where companies become the government and profit is all that matters?)\s\sNext thing you know the government and their corporate cronies will want to monitor our heartbeats our blood pressure our brain signals our every feeling and thought and impulse our health signs etc all for our ""safety"" and ""security"". Then the masses will truly become mere puppets to the elites totally devoid of privacy and unable to escape the totalitarian control of the world's power brokers since the instruments of their oppression will be embedded within their own bodies their own minds. Instead of CCTV cameras and drones think nanobots ""smart dust"" microscopic cameras embedded in the walls of your home or inside that seemingly inconsequential fly that enters your home.Only losers and flunkies need total power.There's no way this will go horribly wrong.

Volunteer! Consider social work!Grew up in rural California we had a cop on campus that arrested students if they fought on school ground but no nurse. This was the case for middle and HS.Typical human treat the symptoms instead of the cause makes the cause worse but hey it's an economic push if schools have to hire security.\s\sWhy is police needed at schools? \s\sWhy are AMERICAN students so aggressive and bring weapons to school in the first place? (happened in berlin Germany too at one school but we know police is not a solution but a part time help) \s\sIsn't there a deeper social problem?\s\sIt's like treating cancer symptoms and hoping it goes away without understanding what cancer actually is.It is more profitable to manage cancer as an illness than it is to take measures to prevent it.American students arent more aggressive. Police are there to hurt them not because they are actually needed.American schools have... police?Yeah  not all of them but large high schools or high schools in cities usually have an officer on campus. In some places middle schools do as well.28.7 million kids in state run buildings with police kinda sounds like prison.Don't be silly they're children. It's called child prison. When they grow up they go work in an adult prison or end up in prison prison.Yes a child or their parent can be arrested for not being in school at least in Texas.Prisons have medical and mental health facilities and staffAlso a new police officer receives 8 hours of conflict resolution training and 127 hours of combat training which emphasizes taking action and shooting people before they become threats.Holy shit? Where is this statistic from? All across the country? If that's the case then people need to reject police departments from local communities entirely.I see this and many people see police as the issue when I see it as society looking for an easy fix and say ""let's let the police handle it""So you‚Äôre saying putting police in schools is a symptom of our society?Nurses at school are a ridiculus concept to me. Over here we just go to our doctor when we need to because everyone is covered anyway. \s\sNow cops at school that baffles me.Having a nurse at school is not for healthcare it's for the inevitable hurt that kids get into. In some places it's also the first line of defense when a kid has issues at home being bullied and so on. I grew up in Romania where we have socialized healthcare and we had a nurse at school. She wasn't there fulltime though.As the others have already mentioned a nurse at school is for the immediate little hurts children inevitably get. You don't need a doctor to treat a scrape or send a kid with a fever home.\s\sCops at school baffles me too though.I was a first aider/educational assistant in a 1000+ JK-8 elementary school. That's based on a two day first aid course half of which is just CPR. A properly trained nurse would have been far better. The untrained office staff would also triage a dozen kids every day without a clue what they were doing.In the UK were also covered but it‚Äôs just if something happens at school and you need immediate care or if it‚Äôs just a kid who can‚Äôt make their own doctors appointments for whatever reason. Or if it‚Äôs just that we need a pad or headache painkiller for the moment.Not only that but while the reasoning for extra security in schools is school shootings said extra security is not really aimed in the right place. Most (all?) school shootings happen in predominantly white/higher class schools (i.e. white on white shootings) but most (all?) metal detectors police forces etc. are placed into disadvantaged predominantly non-white schools. How's that making sense? Other than the obvious racism/classism in society.\s\sEdit: I don't live in the US but I was travelling in California recently and saw a state council debate on TV. A lady from one of the disadvantaged communities was raising this issue.Treating the symptoms not the causes aren't they?This is a call to arms! Get involved! Take the steps forward! Be the change!Why aren't the first three numbers larger than the fourth? Since the first three groups are subsets of the fourth.Exactly what I was wondering.""or"" is ambiguous but I think in this context they meant ""schools that don't have all three"". So the last number should be between the largest of initial three and the sum of initial three. So it adds up.It's just too many people period. Why do people keep pumping out more people omg stopI'm more afraid for the kids in school without a nurse than I am for the ones without a cop.In areas where the safety of the students requires law enforcement to ensure it's extra important to provide counselling social work and basic medical care for the students on campus. One of the biggest issues I've always had with American schools is that they dump FAR too much money into sports programs and underfund both the student care and the education itself. :/Huh.... [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt\_High\_School\_(St.\_Louis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_High_School_(St._Louis))   \s\s\sTHEY STARTED A LOT OF THIS SHIT IT'S 500 YARDS FROM HERE; OUT OF TOWN PEOPLE- FUCK THEM FOR IT PALEESE USE YOUR MAGIC CURRENCY AND NARRATIVE HISTORYBack in the old days schools mostly had teachers and principals who were allowed to paddle students. And parents backed teachers. In many Asian countries teachers still provide corporal punishment and still today are greatly respected. Today Amish communities in the U.S. still practice corporal punishment both in school and at home and their schoolhouses don‚Äôt need massive numbers of staff nor police officers - just one or two teachers and a large number of stuteents of grades K-8.\s\sSince the 1950s the number of students in U.S. public schools has risen some 50%. Yet number of teachers has rise some 250%. The number of non-teaching staff and administrators has risen some 702% percent.\s\sSchools have police officers because kids bring knives and guns to school. The money for administration and for police means less money for anything else.\s\sSchool districts in Iowa spend some $11000 per student per year and achieve 90% high school graduation rates while places like Washington D.C. spend $26500 per student per year (amongst the highest per student spending in the nation) and achieve subpar graduation rates and you can‚Äôt even trust their regular graduates because many failed classes or were excessively truant but were still passed on.> Since the 1950s the number of students in U.S. public schools has risen some 50%. Yet number of teachers has rise some 250%. The number of non-teaching staff and administrators has risen some 702% percent.\s\sI think its worth noting that schools must prepare students to enter a far more *specialized* workforce now than in the past. This is an inevitable consequence of rising complexity in society- the more complex it becomes you face diminishing returns on that complexity. One form that takes is the added time one must spend training individuals in more and more specialized ways.\s\sThat being said I agree with your general thrust. I've been downvoted many times in the past for even mentioning corporal punishment. Nonetheless I mean kids are not going to want to be smacked by a paddle or ruler. \s\sFurther this crap with ""kids cannot fail!"" is ridiculous. The more you neuter accountability (you don't do the work you fail the fucking class) the lower educational performance will drop. Raise the bar- don't lower it. I have actually known teachers who were immensely frustrated because administration *forced them* to ""get the student passing."" These are teachers that had basically lead the horses to water and *begged* them to drink.[deleted]Upvoted and duly stolen comrade.All ruling parties in the world today conservative or ""left wing"" are all some form of globalist liberal that only serve as henchmen to the ruling class. now there's An Inconvenient Truth for you[removed]I'm wary of both RT as a source in general and the current trend of generating a moral panic about pedos whenever sex education materials are updated. Personally as a survivor of child sexual exploitation I wish I'd had the opportunity to learn about masturbation in school materials instead of from the strange adults who were willing to have such conversations with children in informal spaces itself often an excuse to groom children sexually under the guise of science and free thinking.\s\sWhat is definitely concerning about the liberal movement in the UK has been pointed out upthread in an imgur link: by and large committed liberal democrats function as a force multiplier for conservatives leading to an incredible number of deaths at the hand of an ""austere"" (brutal/private) society (DWP alone really).What scares me more than the 1% are the ignorant hordes at their command.

All that capitalism is is for the individual to benefit from the sweat of his brow or his back. For the farmer it is being able to grow enough for his family and have excess to take to the market. For the baker it is being able to make things from the wheat he has bought (capitalism) feed his family and sell his extra goods.  \s  \sA lot of 4chan-ANON Reddit Inc. New Age Millennial Snowflakes don't seem to have the slightest notion of what capitalism is. Capitalism is a form of economics as are communism and socialism. They aren't forms of government like tyranny dictator authoritarian totalitarian theocracy. In this world the Russia (ex-Soviet Union) and China proved pure communism doesn't work. Communism is an economic system but the state/government owns everything and the individual is apportioned a share based on the sweat of their brow or their back supposedly equally. Socialism is half capitalist and half communist from pure communism to the left all state owned to pure vulture capitalism on the right everything privately owned with no government self-policing.  \s  \sCapitalism has all kinds of variation. It is mercenary capitalism and vulture capitalism that eventually eats themselves and that does lead to anarchy followed by war-lords and a return to the feudal system one supreme leader with a cohort of ""nobles"" an oligarchy.  \s  \sThe multi-multi-multi-billionaires of the U.S. have played the game like Monopoly and have won. They need to realize they have won and try to figure out how to distribute dollars from the bank or the other players stop playing.You're describing a market system. Capitalism is specifically a market system that allows for rentierism. In other words your baker and farmer can continue with business as usual in a market system outside of capitalism. Those who will end up screwed in a non-capitalist market system will be people like investors and lenders since they are specifically making money off of the sweat of someone else's brow or back.\s\sHave you read Debt by the way? Arguably the form an economy takes is largely dependent on those governing which means an economic system will indeed be inextricably tangled up in its system of governance.\s\sAt any rate I do agree with your conclusion regarding the ultra-rich of the US. Problem is that I don't think they're in any way interested in playing fair or otherwise doing anything to help those they still see as competition unless they're forced to do so.SS: ‚ÄúThere is a major problem however with using these FPS contract guards ‚Äî who are supposed to be limited to patrolling and securing federal facilities and grounds ‚Äî in long-running ‚Äúcivil disturbances‚Äù like those unfolding now in Portland and elsewhere around the country. The FPS has a long history of failing to properly vet and adequately monitor and ensure that these guards have proper training and certifications including proper firearms training.‚ÄùThey are total clowns the lack of training is evident. On Robert Evans' stream last night a massive line of feds were pushing the protestors back one block. When they reached the next intersection the line of feds all stopped except for three guys at the end that just kept marching towards the protestors not realizing everyone else had stopped. Another fed has to run up and tap them on the shoulder.    \s      \sIirc FPS even said the brutality was a result of a lack of training. I'm sure they were hoping everyone would say ""oh OK I guess you do need bigger budgets.""If anyone has questions for a PSO feel free to ask. I get the point that is being made here but there is also a good deal of incorrect info in this article.isn't this exactly why you americans have the second amendment?  resisting tyranny and all that?Haha right?Yup. I'm sure these rentatroops would act less like badasses if bullets start flying at them.Tyranny in this country doesn't mean putting kids in cages firing at protesters and having federal stooges drag people off in unmarked vans.\s\sTyranny here means the government allowing marginalized groups to get an iota ahead of where they were before.Yes. And people have been calling for gun control and have politicised gun ownership pushing many gun owners to the right.\s\s\sPortland has banned the open carrying of firearms. Do you think the cops would shoot tear gas at peacefull protesters if they were peacefully chanting but had guns?\s\s\sThe reality is the left is attacking the 2nd amendment and it needs to stop. The left needs to be armed.All talk. Well that and a lot of the 2A supporters are on the wrong side...\s\sThey're all talk. Thirty years I've been listening to ""We can't protest! We have jobs!"" then when the pandemic hit they were ""We can't protest! We need jobs!"" Well they finally protested some but not against the powers doing all of this to them it was over a murder of a man by police. Denial again. They seized on that as something they thought they could influence while also using it to pretend the larger issues don't exist.\s\sBut police brutality is not a small issue and I am not trying to diminish it. Protests are warranted but ultimately useless against a regime that doesn't care how it is perceived. They just send in more stormtroopers.\s\sAnd then we have /r/politics. Thousands of Americans there screaming at once ""Vote!"" as if that could solve the problem or even really help when they're now voting in a system controlled by a fascist regime. By voting at all they will be validating that regime and contracting to be governed by it for four more years.\s\sThey're all talk and they're doomed.Portland has really restrictive laws you need a permit to have a gun outside your home there and they don't give out many permits and none at all lately. So very few people in that area can be armed without immediately committing a serious crime just for carrying. Also the Mayor Governor and local DA have been pushing back hard against this action so it's probably a bit premature to call for lighting up the streets with gunfire.They‚Äôre keeping their powder dry. They‚Äôve been keeping their powder dry for thirty years. Apparently keeping your powder dry is a full time job that leaves you quite exhausted.I thought it was for schools...bars and churches.Yeah about that. \s\sTurns out most of the guys hoarding guns are actually pretty crypto-fascist themselves.Conservative gun owners resisting tyranny applied to liberals ?  I don't see that happening.  Especially since liberals are generally the ones trying to restrict gun rights.No the Second Amendment relates to ""a well-regulated militia"" which was what they called a national guard in pre-industrial warfare. ""Resisting tyranny"" is a rightwing talking point to protect gun industry profits when there's a school shooting every other week.It's pretty interesting. I have seen comments suggesting current or ex-military types would not support these actions and that video of the Navy vet getting his hand broken would reinforce/energize that sentiment.\s\sBut after going through some pretty popular ex-military youtube accounts and watching their videos they pretty much all support increased federal action in Portland and in other major city centers and they have serious support from their fanbase. \s\sA lot of people have been saying the military will be on the 'peoples' side when it comes time to choose - I am starting to seriously doubt that.That‚Äôs just the you tubers. Prior service infantry acted as a medic during the mpls riots. These feds make my blood boil and I can‚Äôt speak for all vets but my friends who are also vets that I talk to daily are sick of it as well. We‚Äôre waiting for feds to come to MN so we can start studying and see what gear and tactics they use.I‚Äôm an Iraq vet. These goons are promoting fascism. I don‚Äôt think anyone should tolerate this crap.Like anything else it won't be 100%. It'll be the oathbreakers vs. the oathkeepers.Plenty of quiet professionals in the military.  If they‚Äôre speaking up they‚Äôre probably a loud mouthed ass who will run the other direction at the first sound of gunfire.  I‚Äôve seen it firsthand on two deployments to Afghanistan.  The scariest guys I ever worked with in the military were the quietest dudes in the room.%95 will do as they are ordered.Hahaha what a fucking surprise.\s\sNot.\s\sWhat should be different in america than anywhere else?\s\sBeside the feeling to be great! And make America great again? LmaoRemember Trump pays ""influencers"" and is in effect just a paid one himself.Looks to me like trump and Co. are getting goons in place before the election.How does this win him anyone's vote and not alienate moderates or undecided voters? I see conservatives already distancing themself from Trump. He needs the Hail Mary of all distractions to stand a chance.In place before the extra $600 tacked onto the meager unemployment benefits run out. Perhaps. And/or to stir the pot up to crisis.Remember that America doesn't need to devolve into fascism because fascism is a top-down thing that happens when the ruling elites are genuinely threatened by the working classes and fund and encourage fascism in response. The people at the top of America already have near total power they don't need to encourage fascism. \s\sWhat America is doing isn't really fascism it's just a right wing government trying to ramp up civil tension in order to get another 4 years. \s\sFascism is an ideology. The ruling elite of America aren't ideological they only care about money.there are both the money-hungry and the fascistWe'll have to see how it goes. It's not 100% clear at what stage it is but sure does look like it.  The US already has concentration camps for immigrants; for locals to mimic Germany there would have to be some ""jail camps"" where all the dissidents (protesters and friends) get detained; the detention is obviously on dubious legal grounds; there are likely deadly abuses going on there (in Germany at that time Hitler pardoned the abusers).>Fascism is an ideology. The ruling elite of America aren't ideological they only care about money.\s\sSounds like capitalist ideology to me whether it is ruling elite which you should define or whether it is the people who are the top 25% of income and wealth earners. Define ruling elite for us so we can get on the same page.Kinda goes with the new banner image.Maybe he does lose refuses to concede and starts a stirs up civil unrest.

Let me help. I've invented a new currency it's called the mega dollar. 1 mega dollar = 1 trillion US dollars. You can definitely wrap your head around 21 mega dollar bills.\s\sI've saved you 180 words of reading you're welcome.A megadollar would be a million dollars.  A trillion dollars should be a teradollar.  [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix)\s\sOverall it makes perfect sense to explain what a trillion dollars is.  I have a degree in math and I've worked in finance and yet a trillion dollars is so large I have trouble understanding it.  The article was really helpful to me.Decision-making based on who has the most money and the best lobbyists is something I really hope collapses.yes that's capitalism in a nutshell ... whoever has the most money makes the decisions. \s\sand yes it's collapsing because it constantly puts us in socially retarded situations.If they're MY panels on MY roof then the utility company can fuck right off. I understand they have jurisdiction if you tie into the public utility grid but at that point I would detatch from the grid and tell them to shove itYou can't simply disconnect your solar panles from the grid unless you own a complex (and expensive) offgrid solar system.Fuck law... fuck authority \sOnce again private industry shines through where government would fail. /sThis issue is more complicated than I understand. I have a large 14.7 kW solar array on my home. It is grid tied in New York net metered I love it. Anyway when the power goes out same issue. The array goes down as not too energize the power lines that will be worked on. I briefly looked into the idea of 'islanding' my solar array. The idea would be that when the power goes down I could flip a switch and use the panels on a localized circuit. This would require batteries and specialized inverters. A set up like this would cost an additional $10000 and need continued maintenance. What would I get for that? Not much the few times we go for days without power around here the solar panels are covered in snow anyway. I also understand there are some technical issues syncing islanded power grids too the main grid maybe an electrician can explain this better too me.  However for about $500 I just got a few large marine batteries two inverters. These will power my fridge and sump pump and can be recharged off a car alternator or even the lawnmower. I would use them too power the furnace but I mostly heat with wood. \sSo for my $17 a month hook up fee too the grid I'm basically using the grid as a 100% efficient maintenance free battery. All on a system that was highly subsided by the state which has increased my property value quite a bit. Seems like I'm the one making out well here. I'm pretty sure that eventually this will come too an end with more and more solar generation most likely in the future I won't be able too net meter at a 1:1 ratio. I ain't gunna gripe about it much when this eventually happens but adapt and move on. Maybe turn my septic tank into a biogas plant. How many watt hours you think I could get off a morning dump? How do people who can't spell ""to"" correctly get to be the rich ones?> How many watt hours you think I could get off a morning dump?\s\sA gram of dry shit stores 3-5 Wh of energy. Small biomass plants are up to 30-40% efficient. Assuming a moisture content of 60% your 700g morning dump could yield between 380 and 840 Wh. You could run a fridge off that!Looks like we really dodged a bullet in Hawaii when we said no thanks to NextEra. Florida is such an over-regulated garbage state. Glad I live in a state that actually encourages self sufficient off-the-grid development.Good point.  Let's kill all the utility workers by letting them work on live powerlines.Fucking hell. It's to protect the power workers from getting fried by lines that should be dead having amps passed through them from solar feeding into them.\s\sA worker gets killed and you'd be bitching that the 'evil capitalists' were sacrificing workers for profits. Don't connect to the grid and you won't have this problem. The reason you cannot do this is because having panels pumping juice back into the grid when they are trying to fix lines is going to kill an electrician who thinks the line is cold.\s\sThis is not collapse. This is latestagecapitalism misrepresenting the issue. A bunch of white republican voters shooting themselves in the foot.Good point. Let's kill all the utility workers by letting them work on live powerlines.[deleted]It isn't. I looked into an array with an off grid option for disasters and that was a no-go if I also went with grid tied."

Thank you CIA for the extra dosh.Yep that was my other thought not gonna take long for shadetrees to figure out how to disable this dumb shit lol. Though it's really gonna depend how deeply integrated it is into the rest of the electronics - as the auto industry is headed in the direction of things like integrated internet (cellular/etc) to do things like download software updates and lock/unlock subscription add-ons (ü§Æ)- so if it's very closely integrated with that manufacturers may just have the car try to brick itself if it gets tampered with.\s\sThey could also pull a stunt out of the RIAA's book and just start suing random mechanics and vehicle owners for millions of dollars in ""lost service fees"" or whatever to try to scare people away from breaking hardware/software locks lolThey could design it in a way that would be practically impossible for a DIYer to bypass (like Volvo's fiber optic bus ring system) or design it to ""handshake"" with the LEO equipment and let them know it hasn't been disabled. \s\sBut they wouldn't.

And fancy safety features aren't necessary when you keep your eyes on the road maintain safe following distances and are always prepared for people around you to potentially do the dumbest thing possible. That expectation alone has saved me from a wreck more than once lolI had this cool idea that the ding-dong alarm you hear when you forget your seat belt could just call the cops on you and give them your position. Really easy to automate that.\s\sAlso idk why they haven't banned motorcycles but motorcycles are totally immune to laws like this. They don't make or consider interlocks for motorcycles and most are so simple you could 5 minute YT video and understand how to bypass it anyways. It would be astoundingly dangerous to fit a device like this to a motorcycle so they are exempt.\s\sSurveillance will continue to increase forever as it becomes easier to do. Automated devices will rat you at or mail you a ticket for whatever offenses. This will probably occur in Socialism just as much as capitalism if you want to be real. It's a mindless lensI think drunk motorcycle drivers kind of sort themselves out.In Colorado Suzanne Williams (Dem and Racial trail blazer and vaunted 'Mother of the Year' award winner) tried introducing and passing legislation allowing the police to stop you with all that entitled if they so much as suspected you where not wearing a seatbelt. Turned out pretty bad for her when she killed a pregnant mother in Texas in a head on collision with no one else in the vehicle besides her wearing one. Her son and grand kids (one of which needed to be in a child seat) where ejected from the vehicle. Maybe this will come back to bite them in some way as well.Every time I ride my motorcycle I think how insane it it that someone can get a ticket for not having a seatbelt on but I can do this>  It would be astoundingly dangerous to fit a device like this to a motorcycle so they are exempt.\s\sI once saw a documentary film [where they did this](https://youtu.be/erE6UlOi3E0?t=54) though.>I had this cool idea that the ding-dong alarm you hear when you forget your seat belt could just call the cops on you and give them your position.

It's useful only at low speeds it does nothing at high speeds.[I'll just leave this here](https://www.autoblog.com/2017/03/09/cia-hack-car-wikileaks-assassination-surveillance-eavesdropping/).To think there was a time in American history when the automobile was the pinnacle of personal freedom independence and fun. What's changed in just the past ten years in automotive design is just plain sad.On the one hand I agree but on the other hand I think the infrastructure of the country being designed almost exclusively for cars limits freedoms in other ways. For example a lot of lower income workers are forced to spend a significant amount of their income on a vehicle and the attendant expenses (gas insurance etc) just so they can go to work and get groceries and so on.\s\sTheres no reason we should be forced to use cars when other places show that it's possible to design good infrastructure that lets people get around metros largely without cars and in that way cars can become something people actually *do* use more for fun and recreation rather than just needing one to get from A to B. I've travelled around European countries and not once ever needed to rent a car to get to where I wanted to go and while I enjoy driving in a way that was actually kind of freeing too.\s\sAnyway that being said I agree that it's sad the direction vehicle design is going in what with the increasing reliance on software locks and chips and complicated electronics that Joe Average isn't going to be able to fix in his own garage anymore. More safety features is good of course but what would make drivers even safer is making it possible for fewer people to have to drive at all.1910s: Free to run over street urchins.\s\s2010s: Free to sit in rush hour trafficYou mean when the automobile and car-centric development destroyed the fabric of our cities and towns?

But that's not all gonna change in a day pollution is a serious problem and it's gonna be a crisis if the government can't implement some huge system to basically replace cars before they get outrageously expensive.

If you remember Stuxnet the virus used to degrade Iranian nuclear enrichment it would randomly modify rotational speeds and corrupt an entire batch through slowly deliberate action. In some ways self-driving tech presents the same kind of problem. With over-the-air updates and ubiquitous services patches what would prevent a high level adversary from adding code to kamikaze a random vehicle into a high level target? But we are also seeing the same basic idea in the human driven attacks over in Europe. \s\sHaving a way for police to point a ‚Äústun gun‚Äù like device at a car and stop it dead in its tracks is clearly needed.

The prosperity has never properly returned.Australia should be banned tbhThe world has progressed past the need for Australia.It's bizarre that liberalism is dying and liberals are the ones who killed itLiberalism regularly turns to fascism. Capital is fine with liberalism as long as the money flows but whenever labor threatens their profit they‚Äôre ready to back whoever can best counter labor. Fascists do that so they get supported by capital who also stand to benefit by partnering more closely by the state.\s\sIf the liberal state is going to fall over capital can point it in their preferred direction.\s\sIt won‚Äôt go well for business owners that happen to be outside the designated in-group. But for other capitalists it‚Äôs basically the same. Them and their families will retain the respect and privilege they had under liberalism if not more. \s\sBut what about when the party‚Äôs over? Surely capitalists won‚Äôt like getting defeated by the forces of democracy in the inevitable war?\s\sWell rich people have a way of avoiding consequences. Make a ton of wealth during wartime and then use it to carry yourself overtop the tumult.\s\sGerman capitalists and their companies made it through WW2 largely unscathed all things considered. Krupp spent a couple years in prison for doing a slavery but I think he got out early. His family and business continued to be rich and operate respectively.\s\sSo if you ask a capitalist whether they prefer a humane left wing government that expropriates their businesses or a violent right wing government that will inevitably lead to war you don‚Äôt need to wait for their answer to know their choice.If by liberalism you mean the whole system that contains the left and right side of the aisles then I agreeLiberals are one bad week from becoming fascistNo it isn't they always turn to fascism when capitalism behind to collapseThe contradictions stacked upEt tu Morrison?Yeah but when have the liberals been liberal? I guess they had Hewson who was peak neoliberal. But Hewson was a loser and the party moved on.I love the idea that some of the only people who are actually opposing this draconian globalist biosecurity state are just a bunch of hoi polloi Aussie Bogans who drive trucks and seem to have a better grasp on what‚Äôs going on there than mostAbsolutely loving the liberals cheering on this new norm of turning every aspect of civic life into an airport\sThe only party that opposed it was the greens who are the most liberal Australian party (in the sense America uses the word).What is even a ""liberal"" at this point?\s\sThe people who call themselves ""liberals"" in 2021 are (socially) polar opposites of those in 1971.I read somewhere that the problem with Australian culture wasn't that they were descended from criminals but from prison-guards.I saw something along the lines of:\s\s Australians were \*very* good Prisoners but even better Prison GuardsThere were far more prisoners than prison guards. And more random farmer immigrants than both.\s\sPrisoners weren't very guarded after the first decade or two. They were generally just sold  into indentured servitude for a period before being given a lot of land (only early on; after a while all crown land was sold but there were some golden years for the gravy train of land grants of stolen aboriginal land particularly for those of the right class). The owners of these 'servants' would be pretty free with punishment (and naturally private employment of convicts for profit was where the worst abuses tended to happen) and magistrates were these guys friends happy to approve just about anything and eventually governors had to limit what punishment would be dealt out. Anyway 'employers' figured eventually that most effective tool was to bribe convicts with crappy wages to actually do the work they were supposed to as opposed to whipping them for not doing it. They had discovered a captured labour market. Anyway then the whole thing came down in the 1840-60s because there weren't enough convicts to go around and the other capitalists thought it was a bit unfair they didn't get any. So they stopped the practice.\s\sIf you 'escaped' and ran away the army would chase after you (or just let you die in the bush) then ship you to Tasmania to work in prison camps. Otherwise most convicts would just be given a ticket of leave after a little while which was basically parol.\s\sIf anything when noticeable portions of your uber landowners (gained typically by squatting on crown land and then later buying up the land around you later) and capitalists are former convicts and their descendants; the middle class begins to think that the upper class is pretty crap and the idea of an aristocracy as stupid. Which is what happened. There was only so long high society could snub rich convicts to protect itself.The greens tried to add at least some oversight by the courts but both major parties said lol noCourt oversight turns into courts rubber stamping requests.That would be a gross violation of the true civil right in this country; the right for government ministers to do stuff.This is the type of brain dead shit that the seals on r slash politics would endlessly clap for.\s\sI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an intelligence issue an education issue or a subtle desire to *want* Big Brother to protect us and prosecute The Other but it‚Äôs damning and terrifying.I used to find it so strange that American libs would simp so hard for this shit IMMEDIATELY after the Person They Hated the Most was president. I thought ‚Äúhow could they possibly take the gamble of giving the State that much power when the possibility of another Trump with that power is always within a 4 year possibility?‚Äù But then the other day it kind of clicked that they in some part consciously or not want this draconian imposition because they think/know that in doing so another Trump won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt be elected.

The whole conspiracy theory doesn't even make sense. Espionage is a crime in Sweden as well the US could have asked for an extradition at any point when Assange was in Sweden prior to rape allegations. Potentially being in prison in Sweden would make that much harder not easier.\s\sNot to mention that the case itself is so flimsy that it may very well have gone nowhere if he had simply denied everything. Rape cases go nowhere all the time because they are so hard to prove. You're telling me the combined forces of several governments can convince everyone of their underlings to keep knowledge of treason to themselves but they can't make up a convincing rape case? Why would there even need to be an actual woman at all if ""swedish authorities"" are already all thralls under the illuminati? You could just make it up wholesale.\s\sYou're doing what conspiracy theorists do all the time. You're imagining that the ""illuminati"" is powerful enough to control the world and erase all actual evidence of its existence but incompetent enough that some randos can find out everything.\s\sWhat happened is Assange is a sleaze who took it too far and instead of just doing the whole ""deny deny deny"" bit that is extremely effective with rape allegations because it's word against word he decided the whole thing was some feminist agenda particular to Sweden and ran to the UK. There he was promptly informed that this was a crime in the UK as well and he was then given asylum by Ecuador in a political stunt and Assange then decided on the genius plan of staying confined to a small place for several years to avoid prison.\s\sYou people are on the fake moon landing levels of conspiracy theorizing. You also take things that could potentially be evidence of something else and spin it into the conspiracy with no real basis. if you think you have evidence of swedish police or prosecutor behaving inappropriately than that would evidence of misconduct there not some grand conspiracy. If you think that the women involved are themselves lying or in some other manner behaving inappropriately then that is not even evidence of anything it's just an opinion.>You're doing what conspiracy theorists do all the time. You're imagining that the ""illuminati"" is powerful enough to control the world and erase all actual evidence of its existence but incompetent enough that some randos can find out everything.\s\sIt's not the 'illuminati'. I don't know where you got that. We're just talking about the US and it's not a matter of some 'randos' finding the truth but the public story being completely retarded.\s\s>The whole conspiracy theory doesn't even make sense.

The case was closed but later reopened by another judge while Assange was in Britain. He didn't want to come back to Sweden out of fear of being extradited but the Swedish police refused to come to Britain to interview him there.\s\sParts of the media put it around that the Swedish police never interview anyone in other countries but that was untrue. The Swedish police do interview people in other countries and carried out dozens of interviews in other countries from the start to the time they finally interviewed Assange in Britain many years later.\s\sThe whole thing could have been avoided if Sweden had agreed not to extradite Assange before he arrived for this second round of interviews but they flatly refused. I believe Sweden had extradited people (terror suspects) to the US without trial before.\s\sAssange claimed then that the Americans had a sealed indictment against him and it's public knowledge today that this was probably accurate.\s\s>  You're imagining that the ""illuminati"" is powerful enough to control the world \s\sThe US is powerful enough to exert massive influence in Sweden and many other countries.\s\s> You people are on the fake moon landing levels of conspiracy theorizing.\s\sNo and it seems you grossly underestimate a) the US's diplomatic power b) how much of a threat the US considers Wikileaks and Assange.Your timing is off. You're supposed to accuse people of being insane conspiracy theorists before the facts about the case have been publicly revealed by the prominent UN investigator not after."

If we say to just better yourself while everything is provided I think you will find large swaths of society finding that nearly impossible. \s\sYou only have to look at many rich kids parents. I grew up in a decently nice area and knew tons of people who never tried while they were provided for by parents. It took the kick in the can of after school having to pay for their own stuff that got them motivated to better themselves.Such a soul-crushing post and comment section. The fact that this will never be universally realized and practiced is so sadI think Buckminster Fuller understood soul-crushing at least in some sense.  He almost killed himself in his 30s but in desperation he flipped his perspective on life and instead gave us half a century of creative output.

Blew my mind when I was in my 20s. I might get the message now that I'm in my 40s.I understand that it‚Äôs not currently workable my point is that it isn‚Äôt impossible.  With each technological advancement the total work load on the world population should go down assembly lines should drop the universal work week from 70 hrs a week to 60 hrs a week.  Robotic mechanization should drop it to 40 hrs email should have dropped it to 35 hrs.  As we push more of our work onto machines it should lower the amount of work we do. This currently isn‚Äôt the case for 2 reasons that I can see. The first is the desire for higher profits the second is how we have demanded a higher standard of living.I can throw one more on there: private firms pay static costs on employees. When you factor in on-the-job training and health benefits/insurance you end up with an employee costing some $30000 a year no matter how productive they are or how many hours they put in. \s\sThis incentivizes bosses to work employees as hard as they can get away with which can only be measured (for even higher-ups) as hours. \s\sSo you end up with 10% of the workforce being unemployed and 90% stuck at work for 9-10 hours a day doing 4-5 hours of work and being paid just enough that being jobless is slightly worse. Productivity is irrelevant.Do you really think a lot of people work on assembly lines?  That if we could just improve *assembly lines* everybody could stay home all day?One problem is that even with today‚Äôs technology there is still work that needs to be done by people. How do you justify to those people that they need to continue work while everyone else does whatever they want?I believe it is impossible.\s\sBecause humans.The idea that we have to justify our existence by ‚Äúaccomplishing‚Äù things or by working 40 hours a week and if we don‚Äôt  we‚Äôre seen as worthless failures is so inhumane and disgusting.Geodesic dome!

No sentient creature should be enslaved. But i compromised a bit on that: if it's smarter than a fish it's not cool with me. I would like to go by ""having feelings"" but defining what emotions actually are seems even harder. I kinda don't feel bad about eating fish (or chicken) as opposed to pigs for example so i just take my stance on slave-a.i. from there.I like and agree with this sentiment.

I just shared it with others who do similar jobs and now worry about it getting shared with their bosses cause they might cut my job...""justify his right to exist"" \s\sI have to justify nothing at least not to society.\sI was born in this world without a choice and people expect me to follow which I won't. If I get something that I consider worth getting I might work for it. But justifying the fact that I am here which I have not chosen myself? No.I mean we already can travel to space if we want to. and then we can't build an automation food production system? this is total bsBecause the people in this sub have absolutely zero insight as to the current state of automation and how it progresses. 1 in 12 Americans is employed by the agricultural industry if that gives you any clue as to how far off we are from an automated food production system.If we could have done so we would have. How lazy are the morons on this sub to sit here and whine about why things aren‚Äôt provided to them magically whilst not offering actual solutions. \s\sAutomation is coming and maybe one day everything will be done automatically but not in our lifetimes. So put up and shut up.Agreed. None of us should waste our time producing food clothing housing video games or anything else when somebody else can do it.You had me up to inspectors of inspectors. Believe it or not inspection of the inspection process is necessary. If the point is work as an ideology of necessity is unnecessary making the point by using a pragmatic example as ideological is damaging.lol and who inspects the inspector's inspector if that's such a logical concept? Don't you think it's more about giving the first inspector the same incentive as the going by your model second inspector would need to inspect the former rigorously and uncompromising? I am pretty sure Inspection-Inception is an illogical but still practiced concept to Hamster-Wheel the masses and that any instance of such madness can be logically dismantled with enough scrutiny.Ok but can we do it without population control?I honestly can‚Äôt remember that far backIs this a passage from one of his books ?

Unless it's Buckminster Fuller.We live in a society.. *sigh*.. lolMy hero.This man gets itAmazing.It is one of the hallmarks of the current crisis to 'save the economy'..  as if the economy was something real and not a mass delusionYes! I say this shit all the time I feel like a broken record. I also feel like I'm the only damn person who thinks this way. Everyone probably just thinks I'm a lazy PoS or something I dunno.This shit is the reason I‚Äôll never be able to do my PhDI believe in Tesla.  I believe in free energy.   That people should 'pay' for energy for sustainment should be obsolete.When my mind is uncertain my body decidesBucky was a truly great mind.Very well saidFuck my life then.#GEODESIC DOMES!I'm on board Buck!Yea but the one in 10k that make a technological breakthrough get rich because of the breakthrough and are then hated by all the people on reddit who dont have an equivalent amount of moneyThat's because they're not using the breakthrough to ""support all the rest"" :]I... I had a mini orgasm reading this. Jesus fuck. What sheer brilliance. Take my poor man‚Äôs goldüèÖIf you were living on an isolated deserted island with 6 people and you invented farming most people would simply stop forcing everyone to hunt for food 18 hours a day but capitalists don't see it that way.In the mean time I wouldn't mind gettin one of those inspector jobs.Isn't this just slavery of the minority who is then forced to work to support the rest?The only reason I know what specious means is because of Doug and Carrie HeffernanAnd it's still not his time... And as long as humans are being conditioned his time will never come... I mean look at the average joe and what things government and humanity in general still focuses on... Tragic humans are tragic...The thing I keep coming back to  the thing I can't quite justify is if we get to this point  where is everything going to come from? \s\sOk so most people stop working.  Who supplies food? Entertainment  hobbies housing?You're looking at it back to front. Fuller is challenging  our need for income always coming first meaning we invent bullshot jobs. There are people interested in academia there are people who like making things people who build houses and love it. It's not a nihilistic angle where anything but resting is horrific. \s\sI mean I like washing up. I don't want a job where i do it for 8 hours. The crap part of work is not the doing but our commitment to it to a huge degree.School?  Haha.  No thanks.  Fuck School.  \s\sFuck work and fuck school.\s\sI don't need to ""go to school"" to follow my passions.Reduce cost of living for basic human needs - shelter food water transport - as close to zero as you can. \s\sDon‚Äôt make it about income. Income is supposed to reflect one‚Äôs value in the marketplace based on their skills or ability to provide something of value to others. Plumbers make a good living because they do the job nobody wants to or knows how to. There is value in that. Comedians and musicians do the same in the their own way.\s\sIs there true value in a guy speculating what mortgage backed securities are worth next summer? Or is there real value in the military-industrial complex? If it were just based on protecting citizens during natural disasters or pandemics then yeah. But not planning how to out-missile a neighboring country. Fucking overlords and elitists are worthless I tell ya.\s\sI can live a good life if my basic needs are met. The common person is so stressed out over covering basic needs that they don‚Äôt have time to be creative or solve problems or help their neighbor who needs a hand. There‚Äôs no time for that even though that‚Äôs what really matters while we‚Äôre alive.\s\sOur society is all based on this-for-that mentality and profiting so there can be a newer shinier BMW in the driveway of that ever-growing soulless stick house. When is enough enough? But the ego does what it will.One of the problems we also need to look into is the growing needs of people. If one was content with living in the middle of nowhere with no electricity but enough food to eat and clothes on your back you would not need to work 40 h +. I had a colleague once he worked 20 h a week at an above average paying job and made maybe a bit more than 1000 euros a month. He lived in a cheap apartment had no bed and  went to buy his veggies after the stalls at the marked was closed to save money. He has no car or a pc and has insanely low living costs. He told me ge did not need the stuff. He was maybe in his 50s and was content reading books and following his hobbies in the spare time. He lives in Europe and has universal health insurance. Most of us could live like him but we choose not to. Myself included. We buy a car clothes pc travel and other luxury stuff our grandparents did not know we needed. You could give everyone 1000 euros a month that would cover the basic needs but most people would not want to live that way. As a student I lived comfortably with 800 euros a month and I could live on that now working just 30 % of my current work time but I have goals and things that I want to do that require more money. So our needs keep growing and they will only increase which leads to working more hours.So include each human being on the planet equally in a globally standard process of [money creation](https://link.medium.com/UvEAhrK2J6)\s\sThe flow of 'free' money on the planet goes to Wealth for borrowing money into existence paid for with our labor\s\sThat's why everyone needs a job\s\sTo pay Wealth for nothingI feel like a bum for agreeing with this... We are all wage slavesFucking love this.I'm sure some might pick at this quote; 'but who will do all the shitty necessary jobs?!' but it remains true that for a lot of people besides their job being pointless a lot of their time is taken up writing reports (for increasing accountability) reading and sending emails. The actual stimulating constructive bit is rare. \s\sWhere we are is everyone needs to earn a living so everyone needs jobs and whether we travel to those jobs in a polluting vehicle or when at our job are involved in the production of a product that pollutes the environment we are causing damage. We don't reckon with that at all. \s\sNaysayers can say to everyone who complains: retrain get skills get better pay stop moaning. But people could realise nothing will ever change in society unless things are brought up.!!!Holy fucking shit is my only reaction to thisY'all lazy as fuckWow.  That‚Äôs tense.  And gritty.   I guess you could call it ‚Äòtensigrity‚ÄôWait didn‚Äôt Bill Gates recently say something *veeery* similar recently about computers/AI/automation soon will give everyone less jobs & more ‚Äúleisure‚Äù time?\s\sIs history repeating itself?  Or just mocking itself?Marx literally wrote about all that happening in late stage capitalism some 100 years ago... and the bar for what late stage capitalism constitutes has been pushed further and further up by propaganda since then. Also we were set back regularly with the help of wars. Now there's just no way to deny that we achieved late state capitalism anymore so guys like Billy Boy and Melon Usk play messiah in the hope of positioning themselves well for the future.There is a short essay from Russell called: In praise of idleness. Sorry I'm not linking it now.I always thought about being rich and enjoying finer things in life according to this sub I‚Äôm a bad person though.You're not a bad person for growing up and living in a system where everything revolves around money and everyone is constantly bombarded with ideas and messages about other people's ""awesome"" wealthy lifestyles; giant houses expensive fast cars $300 small meals travelling first class electronic entertainment without end.  \sYou never had a choice or a chance.\s\sI used to think that's the only and best way to life and when I ended up having almost none of that I felt like the worst failure on the planet.  \sIt took me years to see that everything is designed that way. The people in power (which aren't the ones you think) need some of us to ""fail"" at the financial hamster wheels so they have someone to point to. ""Leeches"" ""immigrants"" ""welfare cases"" ""NEETs"" ""lazy people"". Every ruler dealing in the exploitation of people needs an ""enemy"".Depends on what you think the finer things are and whether you think only one should have them or if everyone can obtain them.\s\sWould you still want a large house if everyone could have one and yours wouldn‚Äôt be special anymore? \s\sThe goal of antiwork is not that no human should ever be rich or that no human should work the goal is to find fulfilling work that you want to do and not grabbing the first thing with a paycheck and a scrap of health insurance. \s\sThe goal of UBI is to level the playing field so that everyone could have a place to live good food and the barest of ways to actually participate in society instead of looking up at it from the street.\s\sSome people don‚Äôt want everyone to be level at the start because they feel like their big house and lots of stuff advertises how useful they are. Or that big houses can‚Äôt exist unless there‚Äôs homeless people. They can‚Äôt enjoy their nice steak because everyone can now afford one and they don‚Äôt feel special and rich anymore.\s\sDepends on how you want to get rich how rich you wanna be and how your richness affects others.nobody thinks you‚Äôre bad some people just dont care about being rich and having expensive stuff and wish they could live a simple frugal life without working their ass off for the corporate for next 60 years thats all. its just the idea that nobody asked to be born and yet everyone has to ‚Äûearn‚Äù a right to dignified life as in not starving and having a bed. if you like money and enjoy working then thats great it doesnt clash with the concept of this subI say we go back to the good old days of hunting and gathering. See how many rights you have and how you dont have to work for a living.They‚Äôd still have to work. What a sad fucking group of people this sub is. They literally believe people don‚Äôt need to work. Or at least THEY don‚Äôt need to work and everyone else can provide for them.I don't disagree with the message but 1 in 10000 is a little optimistic. It takes a team of people to make that breakthrough and a team to make the parts that allow that breakthrough. Steve Jobs didn't do much on his own.Sure but I think the point is that micromanagement is a result of trying to keep everyone employed. We dont need managers for managers for managers and inspectors to inspect the inspectors.Missing some pieces of the puzzle. 1 got lucky and had all the right stuff at the right time to make that breakthrough 9999 or 99999 just dreamed they could become that lucky. Merit is an illusion. Teach everybody the same and give everybody the same access and we're mostly interchangeable we can all be Jobs.This doesnt make sense if there are no jobs who will grow our food who will deliver it? And what if you get hirt who will treat you?If only we had a country where the people have the power to decide how to run the system and make the rulesWho pays for your bread \s\sWhere do you get your breadAh yes unemployment good.\sNot as if it gives no motivation for business to produce anything at all as citizens will you know have no salary and end up making mommy government handle all the goods and moneys when that.....actually puts everyone into a cycle or laziness and makes society in a whole unproductive cycle....that makes everyone have nothing because there is noone working or producing...to have money...to buy goods....and stimulate production. \s\sWoah almost as if being a lazy fuck gets you nowhere! How Fun to imagine. But hey why worry about it? The government can handle it all to us! Lets make the government just print more money so they can give us that money and so we can return it in the form of goods and services- Oh wait what's that? Noone in the government is working to produce those products as also noone is working to create any kind of automated production method?\s\sWhoops! Guess starvation and misery is the only path! But hey work bad am I right?#YangstradamusWhat else is there thou I hate working but I also like living with the tech we have todayThat's what I was thinking as well. If everyone had income without working for it what incentives would we have to keep society going? Would the waste management employees still go to work to keep our garbage from filling the streets (like in WALL-E)? Would the reporters still update us on news around the country? It would be volunteer jobs rather than working for survival. How many people would continue working in public transit system? Cab drivers restaurant staff fast food grocery store clerks .... A lot of those jobs have been automated but there still needs to be people maintaining & building the technology. Eventually the taxes would run dry because not enough people are working to pay into the system. If we got rid of money & everything was free how would that even work? Our society isn't mature enough to voluntarily work in high labor thankless dirty tedious jobs.I dont think the idea of justifying your right to exsist is wrong. Who said work justified your right to exsist?This is some im14andthisisdeep bullshit.  \s\sThe inspectors inspecting instruments made for inspectors is dumb. There is typically a reason we have those inspectors it‚Äôs to keep product quality high and safe.   People really here thinking most jobs are pointless don‚Äôt understand anything about how a modern economy works.\s\sThere ain‚Äôt no such thing as a free lunch.no there isnt such thing as free lunch but there is such thing as unnecessary work. in a ‚Äûnatural‚Äù state people would work for their lunch and thats it only do the amount of work required to get by. there‚Äôs no justification for how much time is actually wasted in many office desk jobs and how harsh the treatment of retail workers is. of course people on this sub are questioning the modern economy thats the point. some people just want to live a frugal life without having to be miserable for 8 hours a day for next 60 years thats it plain and simple.This entire sub is im14andthisisdeep.  Probably because this place is filled with children.Great idea until you decide you want to eat something other than rocks and dirt. \s\sAs much as I think anyone who makes over a million dollars a year should be taxed at 90% for ever dollar over that people have had to work to exist.  Housing food safety warmth - they all come with a price - time and effort.  Money is just how we let people exchange that time and effort for the things they need.Jeff Bezos makes $80k a year. So he loves your idea of taking everything over a million a year at 90%.Is there a way I can block this entire subreddit so I don‚Äôt have to loose brain cells every time it shows up on the front page?Lol wtf? People in this sub r so anti-capitalist. Do you REALLY think if the evil capitalists didn‚Äôt need someone to fill a role that they would pointlessly fill it? Cognitive dissonance so hard.\s\sAlso what in the flying fuck is the basis for that ‚Äúfact‚Äù that 1/10000 people can carry the rest with a technological advancement?Okay so... what will these unemployed people do to contribute?Yeah! You deserve the fruits of the labor of others for no other reason than that you exist! Now tell me how you‚Äôre not wannabe modern slave masters? Lol[removed]Because we're actually not your masters we're leeches at your masters mercy. And you are running in circles thinking you might get a better deal somehow by simping for your Bosses on reddit.[removed]Do you enjoy sacrificing 2/3 of your life fulfilling someone else‚Äôs dream of being rich? Do you enjoy giving up 40-80 hours of your week to a job that couldn‚Äôt give two shits about your mental health and well-being? Do you enjoy being woefully underpaid for the job that you do while your bosses hog all of the revenue you worked hard to earn for them? \s\sIf you answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô to any of these then congratulations. You have been brainwashed by capitalism and are probably not the type of person who belongs on this sub.\s\sEdit: He deleted his comments. For you late comers the guy was a troll calling me a basement dweller leech etcFar to the contrary this sub is full of people doing the bare minimum required by bosses because that is the current incentive system.\s\sIf you look through the posts you'll see lots of people wishing they had time to develop skills or work on projects that may contribute to their family or community or the world at large... but which dont pay bills and are thus deemed completely superfluous by society at large.\s\sExample: a stay at home parent produces an absolute ton of added value in terms of relative outcomes and services rendered but doesnt make a single dime doing it. Thus this is STRONGLY disincentivized despite mountains of evidence to their benefit.Hahahahaha look at this brainwashed suit fuck thinking he's hot stuff hahahahahyupIf some how you were transported back in time and you met Socrates and you convinced him that you were from the future would you be able to answer his questions?I think the important questions he asked are the ones that we still ask ourselvesIf I didn‚Äôt have so much fucking money stolen from me every paycheck to taxes I could retire comfortably after 5 years of work. Instead welfare leeches -much worse since I‚Äôm in NYC- own my labor. This pandemic has been such a blessing to the work from home revolution. Planning my move to a low-cost area and now I can retire after 10 years. NYC can get fucked lmao[deleted]Uh what if you had that same house with the exact same freedoms you have with it now but others that didn't before now also have a house with those same freedoms with no impact to your quality of life? Should that not be the goal even if it's a lofty one?Yes. People should just do nothing and everything would be better.. Do what thou wilst I say. Don't worry about anything but your desires \s\sYall realize how silly that is right? Is that really your position?You know how silly it is to think that not breaking your back and soul for mindless employment isn't the same as ""doing nothing?"" Your lack of imagination is so sad.[removed][Imagine being so fucking stupid that you have no idea who you're ragging on to 'own you entitled kids.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller?wprov=sfla1)I get what he‚Äôs saying but IDK relying on one person to make something so that we can all live off of it seems sus. I think that work is important but the idea is to find meaningful work that satisfies us.I think the part you‚Äôre missing is that we‚Äôve already achieved the breakthroughs required to support humanity.  There are plenty of people who find the work meaningful but all the advances in productivity go into funnelling more and more capital to the top instead of relieving the burden on society.[deleted]That's the name of an actual book?  I have to check it out...I just looked up Richard Buckminster Fuller. Very interesting guy.This is one of my favorite quotes love Buckie!What the fuck?Got one of these?  Use a powerful magnet to nuke any parts inside.  If it fails to open the door get a new one then keep the magnet at your desk so you can force them to give you a new one every day until they decide to just give you a low tech badge.  They cant punish you when they can't figure out what happened to their expensive badge.  Or you know ... find another job.Definitely. Non-visible destruction.\s\sFuck it build an electro-magnet just for killing the things if you have to. Claim it's a hobby and that it doesn't effect anything else in your house ""whoops guess your expensive bullshit tracking tool is broken!""This sort of thing reveals a larger problem with work today. If your employees are spending too much time idling in the restroom and the only way for you to realize it is to essentially use a tracking device... then maybe your employees don't have enough meaningful work to do? If they did you'd notice that they weren't getting it done long before you'd have to resort to tracking their bathroom usage. \s\sOtherwise this is just being petty over paying employees for their time instead of their work. Don't want employees to idle on ""your time""? Just pay them what their production is worth ffs. They'll be happier. They'll have more free time (unless they're very slow) and you won't have to worry about them taking moments to themselves as long as work is still getting done.Terrible.  I hope it's a joke.The badges battery will be at 0% before I‚Äôm finished with my time spent on toilet anywaysWill it measure the distance travelled down a managers fucking throat when someone jams the pass down there?

In fact I'm surprised to see this link on this subreddit. I assumed it (this subreddit) would be sucking the republican teet on this one and am glad to see it at least partially is not.Anyone in here his constituent?Thank you. I agree. Everyone should be together on this. You know unless you hate privacy.1000000% agree.  I lurk here to try to better understand viewpoints I tend not to share but this is worthy of cross party outrage.Everyone who understands this is against it (except for the very few at the top who expect it to benefit them).  \s\s\sHe's a conservative.  He does not represent liberal values in any way.Lindsey Graham negative three point ohThat law would break the internet. It's unenforceable anywaysThis is correct. The internet is built on this. You end end-to-end encryption then I can have every one of your passwords credit card numbers and security codes with very little effort. It's not my area of expertise but I've studied enough about network security to understand the dangers of this and even be able to do this.The SC needs to strike this down and he needs a clue-by-fourParadoxically as the EU requires E2E encryption.  There's literally no way to comply without splitting the Internet in two.can someone explain this as you were explaining it to an infant?[deleted]Under current law specifically section 230 of the Communication's Decency Act of 1996 ISPs and other service providers (Facebook Twitter Youtube Whatsapp etc) have blanket civil immunity from whatever users send through their services including child porn unless they are made aware of the unlawful usage and fail to take action. \s\sThis bill would create a commission that would create standard practices that a company must follow to maintain that immunity. If they fail to meet the standards or have certified equivilant protections they would open themselves up to lawsuits from anyone damaged as a result of their service. So if a victim of child pornography found out material of them was shared via Facebook they could bring a case against Facebook for facilitating the distribution of that material. This doesn't mean they would win but the case wouldn't automatically be dismissed like it would be today due to Facebook having Section 230 immunity.\s\sWhat those standard practices will be we don't know yet. The tech community says that the only way for them to police all the content that goes through their system is to be able to view it and that would rule out one of the most secure ways to send information ""end to end encryption"" in which the content is scrambled by the user's phone/computer before the service sees it. They say that while this law wouldn't make End to End encryption illegal removing Section 230 immunity would have a chilling effect on the tech sector. \s\sOne practice the tech companies fear would be added would be to require services to have a ""back door"" so they can unscramble messages and scan them. Tech companies say the existence of such back doors make the entire system vulnerable to hacking.So we're going to let people who know nothing about technology write bills that effect necessary protection and privacy like encryption? \s\sLawmakers: *doesn't understand simple technology*\s\sAlso lawmakers: *bans it because ""it scare me""*\s\s\sGet fucking realSounds like gun control.Lindsey Graham is an embarrassment. He's a warmonger like McCain and relentlessly looks to increase the power of the surveillance state.> relentlessly looks to increase the power of the surveillance state.\s\sLike any authoritarian.There are no much more commie and big gov things you can come up with than a total control over information.Wait then why is he the one pushing for it being a major conservative?There are many ways to fight child porn but you don‚Äôt do it by making secure end-to-end encryption an illegal action that is just beyond fucking asinine! **Can you imagine how dangerous it would be to make all of our private information way more accessible to internet hackers (private and domestic) around the globe?** How expensive that would be for all people and businesses around the globe?  If we‚Äôre going to do this how about we stop all mail just to stop drug trafficking. Holy shit this is fucking INSANE!There are some Republicans that are true conservatives but the Republican party is a big government entrenched pile of shit almost as bad as the Democrats and if they could get rid of Trump without fucking their party they would.> get rid of Trump without fucking their party\s\srepublican party loves trump what are you even talking about""Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""  -- Ben Franklin.This guy has never sent an email. This guy wants you to turn over all of your back door encryption to him so that he can keep the general public safe. This guy will be the reason that your identity and life savings get stolen. This guy that knows nothing about technology is sponsoring this. Follow the money on this one.[removed]It's always about stopping child porn terrorism etc. It's the usual tactic of distraction. \s\sThis throws the baby out with the bathwater.  But it does expose the weaknesses in the intel community and the ability to break encryption.  \s\sEncryption is a win for us.As a resident of South Carolina and an ardent Conservative Linda is not your friend.I miss TreyNot okay. Even on 'our side'.Linsey Graham is in the same boat as McCain and Romney as far as being fuckheads.Whoa now! THIS BETTER NOT HAPPEN!!Wouldn't\shouldn't this violate the privacy clause of the Constitution?There‚Äôs no such clause. The word privacy isn‚Äôt found anywhere in the document.How did we let so many people without morals get these kind of positions!?We didn't let them get these positions. We put them into those positions. We voted for them donated to their campaigns and volunteered our time to advertise for themThe govt is grabbing power right now. Don‚Äôt let this happenFigures he would be back at this crap soon. Hes also been working on a bill to limit firearms and impose restrictions.I will be following this developing story with great interest. Hoping the bill doesn‚Äôt destroy encryption.Oh fuck off LG. Do you have any idea what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about?I am so glad to see this I feel like liberals and conservatives are so polarized but at least we both know bullshit when we see it.Bipartisan things in USA\s\s1. Taking away rights\s\s2. Big spending\s\s3. War\s\sBoth sides never do anything good when working together.This tool represents my district. I'll be sure to mention that when I contact his office about this idiocy.Liberal here. Good to see nobody is onboard with this bullshit.As a pretty far left liberal I absolutely agree this is disgusting and should never be allowed to pass. The right to privacy is incredibly important.honestly lindsey grahams always been kind of a piece of shit from what i've seenThis is unlikely to pass. Last year when the Trump administration considered banning end-to-end encryption ([source](https://www.idropnews.com/news/trump-administration-considers-banning-end-to-end-encryption/110197/)) there was bipartisan opposition just as there would be to this bill.Josh Hawley will be a major source of opposition for this bill he generally knows what he's talking about when it comes to tech.Just when I was starting to like the guy he pulls this shit.Lindsay graham is a swamp creature.I read the article but didn‚Äôt really understand  it. Could someone dumb it down ?This isn‚Äôt just a Republican bill it has bipartisan support. Even more reason to write or call your senator and let them know you‚Äôre opposed to this. I'm from the government and I'm here to help.HELLO NOThis is treasonous. Where is the outrage from the house and the senate. \s\s\sDianne Feinstein is also supporting this.Pretty fucking stupid. That's like suing money because ppl use it to buy illegal thingsLindsey McCain.Approval in the Senate is bipartisan let's be bipartisan in opposing itGonna be tough to defeat.  It‚Äôs not just graham.  It‚Äôs a bipartisan effort kinda like the patriot actIts like Lindsay just can't let himelf be likeable.  Everytime he gets respect because he scoured some leftist or their shitty talking point he turns around and does something shitty like this.Hardcore lefty here. I'm excited we can agree on this. I initially came here to to view what is going on in your community regarding Covid-19 related stuff but saw this and was excited I can agree with ya'll here. \s\sUpvotes for all and please be safe. Wash your hands and keep a good distance from others. \s\sFlatten the curve!As an independent I like to see level-headedness on an issue which should not be partisanI thought Rinos were extremely endangered but every time I turn on the news I hear about another one.Time to go. We can't be the problem. He's got to go. These idiots either don't know what they're doing or worse they do. He's got to go away. Vote him out.What the fuck is he doing lolIt looks like a lot of you don‚Äôt quite understand what end-to-end means in this context.\s\sGet a free [protonmail](https://protonmail.com)  account so that you can learn about it before it is ‚Äúbanned‚Äù.\s\sThe company was founded by people from CERN in Switzerland (where the WWW was born).  It has gotten millions of euros of funding from the EU.\s\sThe US cannot make protonmail go away without a nasty diplomatic war involving sanctions and threats of jail.  That *may* be the actual goal of this legislation.\s\sWith protonmail the mail cannot be read on the ‚Äúserver‚Äù computer.  Neither Apple or Google offer this.  Courts sign warrants to search Apple and Google all of the time.  That is technically *impossible* with protonmail.\s\sBTW:  their free iPhone app is better than Apple‚Äôs own mail app! (I haven‚Äôt tried android yet)Of course but it means that the interpretation of the cause is based on the jurisprudence of 5 justices who would decide if this was constitutional should it be enacted. \s\sIt‚Äôs a roll of the dice that I would be hesitant to trust.a believer in whoever pays him most that week**Even the tech corporations like Apple wouldn't support this. I wonder which lobbyist convinced Graham this was a good idea.Yeah this is bullshit. Typical politicians trying to muscle in a shady bill during a crisisAs a devout liberal I wholeheartedly agree; besides the conservative fears of giving the government an in there is also the fact that doing so makes encryption as a whole less secure for EVERYBODY. If you give Uncle Sam a way in others will find it and wiggle their way in.He doesnt care about regular people. Just the money lining his pockets. Look at his track record.fucking assholeFinally something we can all agree is flat out wrong.\s\sNow let's see if they care or if we truly care.Lindsey Graham is a first class piece of shit. I live in South Carolina. That guy Next to Mitch McConnell are two of the worst people in the government.Yea this article is conspiratorial trash... The connection between this bill and the regulation of e2e encryption is tenuous at best. The main source of the article is a leftist lawyer/professor speculating that changing 230 to remove protections for civil liability is somehow an outright ban on e2ee.\s\sThis hit r/all so I'm prepared for the down votes but this is nothing more than more NN circlejerk propaganda.You knew damn well he was a snake.The only people who stand to benefit from this are intelligence agencies.\s\sScrew them.Why tho??????I'm getting gun control vibes from this.  \s\s\sMake millions of people vulnerable to criminals in an attempt to solve a problem that is very small in comparison to the problem it will make and tread on people's rights in general.honestly fuck these people.  they dont care about what we the people want.  how about you bring some ppl to justice mr Graham??The problem here is the old idiots don't understand technology. This guy couldn't set a clock on a VCR and those have been obsolete for 20 years.r/LeopardsAteMyFaceFuck this guyThere is nothing conservative about large government or privacy infringements.US politics are no longer divided in ""Conservative"" and ""Progressive"" but ""Corporate"" and ""Popular"". \s\sCorporations want your data and they can't get your data if you encrypt it.And popular is divided between left and right. We have these petty disputes over the economy but we ignore the elephant in the roomNo one liberal or conservative should want this.  I am a liberal and generally support big government but this is too far. It isn‚Äôt democratic or republican.  It‚Äôs authoritarian.I agree but I‚Äôve seen a couple people over on r/politics saying ‚ÄúIf It CaTcHeS a RaPiSt.‚Äù And it‚Äôs honestly kinda sadNever trust a Neo Con.What is Trump then?South Carolina should get rid of this selfish hypocritical prick. In November his seat will be contested and hell I'd rather have a Democrat(still preferring another Republican) instead of him.That‚Äôs wrong.  The Senate confirms judicial nominees.Lindsey Graham is most certainly fucked in the head but god damn that article is just as much of a mess as this bill.\s\sGizmodo is leftist trash  find a non-bias article pleaseChina?They get you fucks every time.Yeah we have to deal with asshatery on issues like this way too much. But even then it beats the twinkie tied to the end of the stick you idiots follow off a cliff 24/7As a Trump supporter I despise this POSSince when did the GoP still give a shit about Conservative Principles? Why would they start now?But think of the children....Graham does whatever donors tell him to doThis is reviled by both Democrat and Republican constituents. I have no idea what they think they are trying to pullWell Lindsey Graham doesn‚Äôt believe in Conservative values or small government. This piece of crap needs to fade into obscurity with the rest of the neocon warmongers.Can anyone help the uninformed to understand why he would want to do this?EekMost disturbing is the required make up of the (16 member) committee. As a bill ostensibly crafted to provide a means of fighting online child sexual exploitation there is no requirement for the representation of civil liberty advocates or industry voices. It's wall to wall activists and lawyers.We can't undermined the private central bank The Federal Reserve!Earn what? This bill is retarded without question. Dumbasses can‚Äôt even safeguard our identities or secure our elections and want to remove basic computer security measures.Hey it will make using wireshark easier.Post this on r/politics and call Graham a trump lover and you‚Äôll be front page and have bipartisan hate of this bill in no timeThe link doesn‚Äôt get approved xDRednecks lolImpossible to implement.Sigh sadly my state will keep electing this weasel.I would say better than a dem but idk...\sEdit: I‚Äôd rather have him and a Republican Senate than not him and a democrat oneI read the draft of this bill and it doesn't mention encryption at all. Is there some other source that people are using to claim that end-to-end encryption would be banned by the committee created by this bill?It is worse than abhorrent it is stupid.This is the type of thing that turns techie types away from conservatism.  As a conservative techie myself I wish they'd just get a clue and stop pushing crap like this.What does this bill actually say?\s\sAll the headlines are fear mongering it but I've yet to see a cool minded analysis of it.We made a huge mistake giving up privacy during the Post 911 administrations and this would be more of the same and completely unconstitutional.\s\sAlso let's try to minimize the cram down of policy by bureaucrats who are clearly tech-ignorant.I don't understand this. The FBI already has no problem tracking people without the need for this kind of privacy breach. \s\sIt just screams ""how do I open pdf""RINOMs Lindsey strikes againOf course he is a bitter old twat. His ma and pa clearly didn't want him to anything else.Can we out Graham? As a democrat I mean.Holy shit Gizmodo? You fucking idiots do realize this is fake news right? Do you really think Lindsey Graham intends to put an end to all internet shopping and business?Yep if that bill is passed we will have to EARN our privacy back fuck that billthey're assholes beyond measure.  especially the irs.  one a positive note they're all too stupid to route out all encryption.  you might have to learn what you're doing a bit but they can take it away from you completely.   go learn openssh.This old geezer needs to put on a diaper & retire. If they continue passing under the desk bills like that and we disagree how are we going to protest once quarantined is enforced by law as is in some European states already due to virus?You missed Feinstein who's been trying to get rid of encryption since the 90's is attached to the bill.Small government is for the pre 1850 southern crowd\s\sLindsay is just doing what he was paid to doThis is quite literally the opposite of what we need to do to keep the Senate./r/leopardsatemyface to anyone who considers themselves conservatives and votes for the current republican party.Trump will sign off on this with a smile on his face as he did the last surveillance bill and the corporate welfare bailout for banks\s\sAnd then you morons will still vote for him come Novemberthe bill is bipartisan it doesn't matter who you vote for. The one thing both sides can agree on is giving the NSA more powerEarn it is about 230 protections. Tech companies have to earn 230 protections. Earn it is about holding Reddit accountable for destroying TD. The fact that this sub bys into fake news and lies is a testament to the ignorance of reddit. Reddit censors conservatives and this sub wants the bill to hold them accountable blocked... jesus.Did you make that fresh account just to complain about private corporations exercising their right to free speech?What a surprise the Conservative party has authoritarian intuitions.Definitely sucks to see this when it comes up but thank goodness we arent Leftists who willingly run into the arms of authoritarianism any chance they get.This whole thread is on some leopards ate my face shit. This is what you voted for this is what you support. This is the GOP.This is Lindsey Graham. You sound as though you believe every single person on this sub has the ability to and did vote for him.The bill has more Democrat sponsors than Republicans.[removed]Gonna ignore the Dems behind it too? \s\sOf course you will. \s\sDont get me wrong the vast majority of us are turning (again) on Graham because of this shit but at least we are acknowledging it.A dem is helping him write it. This is right out of the communist party play book.From that logic this is a collaboration with communist and fascist parties of america?[removed]I like how you had to explain what we should all think about this in the title.You claim to love small government but in reality you love an authoritarian government. You claim to be small government but want the government to control a woman's body. You claim to be small government but vote for politicians who support the patriot act which is unconstitutional. You claim to love small government but won't even legalize marijuana. You claim to love small government but cheer whenever the US acts as world police and institute illegal offensive wars across the world while overthrowing democratically elect leaders. \s\sCan you guys drop this charade of small government? It's such bullshit at this point and anyone with an iota of intelligence can see right through it.[deleted]Stop your fucking scare mongering! This is the same Bullshit they always use to take away rights! \s\sOh don't want your rights stripped well only criminals use this for appalling shit.

My tails is completely anonymous and you‚Äôll never in a million years be able to legislate that to some sort of transparency.TAILS is run via The Onion Router which was invented by the US government. I guarantee you they already have a backdoor into onion routing.That's not good but it is more about developers of proprietary clients for proprietary services being almost forced to put backdoors and spyware in.\s\sProprietary software contains backdoors by definition(in security context) and when one speaks about E2E it kind of means that communicating sides control the endpoints not the service provider so this wasn't real E2E.\s\sAnd those legal problems are not a threat to anything non-proprietary if I read this correctly.\s\sSo it's almost good news maybe more people will start using XMPP instead of {Viber WhatsApp Telegram} and Fediverse instead of Facebook.\s\sEDIT: I mean the whole point of E2E is that some company provides only a medium for some encrypted data.flip side I was in a jury and and a utter worthless scum bag heroin dealer and wife beater got off because of some idiot liberals and the fact the police could not get into his Iphone they got into the Android phones (they had two phones each) again im not a libertarian I care  more about protecting society than individual freedoms  I seen what almost  total freedom does (exuding free speech) I live in  London   protect the privacy of innocents yes  but not criminals in courtWarrants exist for a reason.\s\sThe only people opposed to this are drug dealers and kiddie porn losers.And people who like their privacy. Just because I don‚Äôt have anything to hide doesn‚Äôt mean I wang big daddy government snooping in on me. A warrant comes from probably cause and if there is probably cause to believe someone is breaking the law that‚Äôs when rights become secondary.I'm not hiding a stolen TV in my basement but I still don't want the cops coming to take a peak whenever they please.Not so sure. \s\sThe Constitution said we have the right to be secure in our persons and papers not immune.\s\sToday's encryption abilities place data outside the law.I'll flip it for you the Internet doesn't allow the government to leverage it into everyone's home and personal conversations. When the marginal cost of surveillance is zero we've lost all liberty.do you also think it should be okay to bug everyone's home because they MIGHT commit a crime sometime in the near future?Creating backdoors for the government doesn't sound very secure.So does burning something. We should ban burning of anything.Sir you are *shockingly* retarded.Encryption is a form of protection. It is used for good just like it can be used for bad. Just like your right to bear and own firearms for your physical protection. Giving the government the keys to all encryption is like giving the government keys over your firearms. I'm sure most people in this sub would agree that giving government fill control over anything is not in anyone's best interest.Astonishing is it not?  How did he do what he did for so long?  And where where the people protecting these young ladies? Absolutely sickening.  It's gone beyond ""what if"".  It apparently did happen and these girls/young women need to live with this.  I wish he'd gotten his due in the court system (along with his fellow inmates) but I just hope so much more for the victims.

Nope as a matter of fact the Taliban now OWNS those weapons and helicopters thanks to your incompetence.I'd love to hear an Australian defend this. I guess this is for the good of the country. Right?

I'm done with this stupid shitThings went downhill quick for Australia after they turned their guns in....Yep I remember being younger and whenever I was asked the question ""Where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world?"" I was stupid enough to always say Australia. Beautiful scenery exotic animals sexy accents..... And absolutely Orwellian politics. I wouldn't step foot in that shithole if you paid me.That's what we've been told... take away the 2nd the 1st is next to go.You familiar with the Patriot Act?[deleted]Nah.

A perfect teaching moment for Americans.And people wondered why it was important to resist masks and vaccine mandates.\s\s  \sThe best part is that all of these countries are proving the slippery slope argument as valid. All I was taught growing up in debate classes that slippery slope is a terrible argument yet this entire covid fiasco has been predictable every step of the way.\s\sConveniently we've gotten to see exactly how communist ideals become so popular so quickly.It‚Äôs such a Reddit thing to do. Use hard logic only when it benefits your politics and demonstrate only the basest understanding of it in an effort to appear smart and informed. A lot of people on this site and on the Left in general just cannot seem to wrap their heads around social intelligence and how people will react to being given more power. I don‚Äôt understand itComing to a US State in due time.Who would've thought that Australia  a nation established by criminals and those who rebelled against the authority would become the next authoritarian state. Just never saw this coming from them.Do you mean the criminals themselves? Or Australia as a nation rebelling against authority. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sBecause hell they sure didn't fight for independence from Britain like at all.

Think it'd confuse anyone ?This is the USA that the mainstream Democrats want. Thank God for the 2nd amendment.Can't wait for Australia to spy on US citizens and pass the information on to the CIA /sWhat a wake up call to get rid of smart phones.

That is some scary shit.  I truly feel bad for Aussies right now and I'm so very thankful that we created a document a couple hundred years ago that at least makes it more difficult to trample all over our rights as people.  Still they are eroded by the political left on a yearly basis but it does make it much harder to destroy these rights here.The Australian government took to heart that infamous quote by Rahm Emmanuel about not letting a crisis go to waste. And in this particular case the crisis is artificial.Notice how governments are now trying to get into your phones all at the same time?Australia is lost. Canada is next.When did the Aussies become so wacked? Pretty decent people from what I've met and observed.Biden's (well pelosi and schumer) policies will make America be the next target for this sort of stuff...they want to control social media and TELL us what we should think and what the truth is.

I've visited Australia three times and wished I could had stayed...up till now! Their government has gone off the rails!I have been thinking about democracy.  That democracy is overstated in providing freedom.  The freedom is provided by having a small or poorly functioning government.  Elected or unelected is overstated.\s\sSo who is freer?  A person in a dirt poor country where the government is too poor or inept to control their life.

[deleted]Civics is still taught I teach it.\s\sHowever civics education is overrun by inane ‚Äúservice learning‚Äù and pseudo-activism.\s\sOn top of that most students just don‚Äôt care about learning. They‚Äôre infinitely more interested in Instagram and fortnight than anything a teacher could be doing.Demonstrates very nicely the stranglehold the left has had on education starting in elementary school and is a sad commentary on the weaknesses that some parents manifest. As a freedom of speech I say it is our public school educational system fault. LolFrom another article\s\s>Students who did not want to participate in the walkout were instructed to gather for a study hall but Shoemaker reportedly felt that by joining fellow students who didn‚Äôt protest he would also be taking a side.\s\s>‚Äú‚ÄôThe biggest problem Dad is that there shouldn‚Äôt be politics in the classroom ‚Ä¶ I may just sit in my seat. As far as I‚Äôm concerned that‚Äôs the least intrusive of the choices I‚Äôve been given‚Äù Shoemaker said according to his father Scott Shoemaker.\s\s...he isn't wrong tho.\s\s\sNo he's not but I think the issue was leaving a student in a classroom unattended. Suspension seems a bit harsh though.Freedom of speech includes the freedom not to speak I wish more people would exercise that particular freedom...And they said these protests weren't mandatory smh. He wasn't asked to speak. He was asked to go to study hall so he wouldn't be left unattended in a classroom. You can't not take a side in this case either you support the walkout or you don't.What a backwards way of thinking. And at least 3 adults had to be on board with this I understand the need to keep students supervised but having 1 of the teachers hang out in the classroom with him probably would have been a better solution to this.But that teacher had to virtue signal. Teachers can‚Äôt be one on one with students [deleted]Former teacher here. Thank you for posting this. This thread is pretty infuriating. So they are making him miss class for not wanting to miss class?The young man just wants to stay neutral. That is not acceptable to school administrators they want people to have labels. Pro Gun or #Enough movement. One is not longer allowed to not express their feelings and stay out of the talk. If you choose to do that you are suspended. I bet more than half the school board are prior educators.\s\sThese educator dominated BOE people just reinforce the nonsense the school administrators political agendas and how they implement them with our children as the pawns. The NEA is more for protecting administrators and than so the teachers they profess to represent. The administrators have blundered the STRS retirement fund in Ohio teacher's union did nothing to stop it.> The young man just wants to stay neutral. That is not acceptable to school administrators they want people to have labels\s\sI am guessing you don't know a lot of school administrators.\s\sThe main concern is to keep kids safe.  Today there are a lot of rules for that don't be alone with a kid don't leave any kids alone anywhere else - you get sued if the kid accuses you of anything. You get sued if a kid gets hurt.  You get sued for anything.\s\sTo work in a school is a royal pain in the ass. Parents think you're an asshole for not giving their little shit an A+ on everything. The administration is pissed that you're not passing the little shits to show how well you taught them and you are pissed as a teacher that nobody cares about actual academia.\s\sConservatives think you're in a liberal cult.  Liberals need you to not use binary genders but to be neutral or you're some child-oppressing Nazi. \s\sFor this pleasure you get paid $30K/year and have to buy pencils and notepads for the kids and can't make more than ""2000 copies per school year"" because there's no budget.\s\sSomething something a mile in their shoes.[removed]What was the study hall and it‚Äôs purpose.  If it‚Äôs a counter protest on his part that‚Äôs one thing.   I want to know more to be perfectly honestIf they can leave the school without authorization than this kid should be able to sit there without authorization. You can‚Äôt selectively enforce the rules. Sounds to me like the study hall is the counter to not wanting to attend the walk out. In that case I think he should go to study hall. Staying alone in a class room could be a liability for the school for all we know. He's being aggressively neutral A student should never be forced out of his classroom. The teacher doesn't get to make the choice to not be in that room and then punish a student for it.Yes thank you. I said the same thing but was a bit more combative about it.[removed]The problem is the teachers wanted to protest.  They should have been in the classroom Bs.  Our tax dollars don't pay for study halls.  Our money goes to the teachers to do their damn jobs.  There is no way the liberals would say what you're saying if roles were reversed > The district says it's responsible for students' safety and they can't be unsupervised.\s\sSo either you let all your *other* students leave the building unsupervised or all your teachers were leading the protests leaving no one to supervise this child. Both are unacceptable IMHO.He said he didn‚Äôt want to pick sides. Meaning he didn‚Äôt want to participate at all. That should have been an option as the protest wasn‚Äôt a part of the curriculum.THIS IS FAKE\s\shttps://www.10tv.com/article/district-post-saying-hilliard-student-suspended-over-walkout-refusal-fake\s\sThe fucking ijr article even links to this.  What's wrong with y'all? \s\sIf it sounds ridiculous and makes you angry look deeper! Be discerning! Don't fall for this Breitbart trollbait all the time people!The article you provided says that the school district denies the suspension as being real while the child and his father say it is real. Did you even read the story you linked or did you just read the headline?\s\sHe was suspended for staying in the classroom to study during the protest instead of going to the designated ‚Äúanti-protest‚Äù area in the commons. He didn‚Äôt want to protest on either side of the issue so he did what he thought was the most neutral. \s\sHe wasn‚Äôt assaulting other students or disrupting class in any way. The magnitude of the punishment dealt out to him quite obviously had a political bent.I graduated Hilliard Davidson my daughter is there now as a freshman I know multiple teachers who I graduated with. THIS IS COMPLETELY FAKE!!!!!Those who resist will face re-educationIf this is legit lawsuit. And hit 'em hard. The sooner the public school beast is brought down the better.On what grounds could they sue?forced progressivism...or progressivism. I know we all cheerlead the left but they are beginning their dictatorial march. And most of us promote the agenda...[removed]But why was there not an option to continue class?  That‚Äôs all he wanted to stay in the classroom and continue the *scheduled* class. The school changed the class schedule and essentially canceled class to accommodate a protest. \s\sLet‚Äôs look at this from another perspective. If a group of kids had a walkout to advocate for teachers to carry guns what would the outcome be for those that walked out those that went to the study hall and those that wanted to stay in class?Spending 20 mins out of your day to hold a memorial for dead children isn‚Äôt the worst idea ever. I don‚Äôt see a problem in what the school did as long as no politics was injected into the walk out. If schools can hold assemblies and pep rallies they are well within their power to sanction a non political demonstration. \s\sThe staff likely had to go outside to supervise the children. Having 1000 unattended high schoolers marching around the neighborhood probably isn‚Äôt the best idea. So they probably had a couple teachers stay inside to supervise the kids that didn‚Äôt go out. The duty of the school is to keep the children within the confinements of the school and operate as normal while actually doing what they are paid for the problem is that when the school employees assist the students in a protest this makes them culpable for the students that protested instead of staying inside the confines of the building and operating as normal. \s\sIts simple you follow the rules already set out for the school and make multiple announcements that anyone leaving the building faces whatever punishment is outlined. If students break those rules then THEY are the bad actors who deserve punishment. When the school employees ***assisted with their political act*** they now are on absolutely indefensible legal ground. Yes they should have *followed* them and then promptly handed out the appropriate punishments. \s\sLawyers will tear apart every single school that punished anyone for not wishing to participate in an organized political protest and these school employees deserve to be called out for their actions.\s-\s Here is your constitutional challenge - \s\s* What if 50 students decide to walk out next week to protest against abortion what happens to them? \s\s* What if next month there is *national pro life walkout day* and students from accross the country dont get the same EQUAL TREATMENT that was afforded to this walkout?He wasn't suspended for disagreeing with the protests or failing to take part in them he was suspended because he refused to attend the alternative (a study hall session).  This has nothing to do with free speech so much as him refusing to listen to school administrators.  That was the ""not picking a side"" option he elected instead to be a little shit.  [deleted]ProtestceptionThere's supreme court precedent here. This kid has a healthy lawsuit against the school district that lawyers are going to be throwing themselves at to secure representation.How you handle this situation: \s\s1-Mark all protesting students with unexcused absences.\s2-Teach the remaining students as you are paid to do.\s\sIf the protesters wish to skip school for their political agendas let them. All actions have consequences.Completely fake!!! I am a graduate of Hillard Davidson my daughter is a freshman now I am a member of the PTO.  This never happened. Won't see this on r/all or r/news.I hope this student sues. He came to school to go to class. Punishing him for that is beyond the pale. On what legal grounds would he sue?The definition of compelled speech. R/Columbus is reporting this as fake. Seems pretty fake.The school district released a statement regarding the suspension.> The district says it's responsible for students' safety and they can't be unsupervised.\s\sSo either you let all your *other* students leave the building unsupervised or all your teachers were leading the protests leaving no one to supervise this child. Both are unacceptable IMHO.Why haven't we heard about this guy?\s\sThe footage showing the August 2016 death of Tony Timpa in Dallas shows an officer pinning him to the ground with his hands cuffed behind him for nearly 14 minutes as the 32-year-old eventually becomes unresponsive. Officers are heard joking that Timpa had fallen asleep with one yelling ""five more minutes mom!""\s\sWhere were all the companies sending their solidarity tweets? Where were the people that now say they want police accountability? Where was the night to night coverage on the news for a full two weeks?\s\sAnyone remember the name Justine Damond if you had to look it up that's the state of the news. Did you know it took eight months for the cop to even be arrested? Charged with third degree murder and now will serve 12 1/2 years.\s\sWhere were the Twitter campaigns for her? Where were the calls for accountability then? Why wasn't there a riot to get the cop arrested quicker? We were told it's the only reason the cop in Mr. Floyds case got arrested was because of the riots.\s\sEdit: Just in case someone hits the paywall http://archive.is/4IPIgWhat's amazing is people actually protested for Justine's killer. \s\sIt's also astounding that Australians care more about an american getting killed because of the narrative while never having protested the killing of their citizen. \s\sRelated video: https://youtu.be/tm86QPhCwFcI wonder why i never heard about this one not like there is an agenda or anything.Facebook deleted posts about him even ones his own family posted.Stupid paywall. Can't afford every single site on earth...http://archive.is/4IPIgIncognito mode usually helpsThere has been coverage of this instance. It's just been added to the pile of recent deaths.Barely a blip.White guy nobody cares.This white guy thinking he can take attention away from George Floyd! smh\s\s/sThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called White Privilege.That title thoughI don't know what happened.\s\sI am shame.- Timpa called 911 in Aug 2016 saying he was afraid and needed help. He told a dispatcher he suffered from schizophrenia and depression and was off his prescription medication.\s\s- Timpa wailed and pleaded for help more than 30 times as officers pinned his shoulders knees and neck to the ground in 2016. \s\s- ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna kill me! You‚Äôre gonna kill me! You‚Äôre gonna kill me!‚Äù\s\s- After Timpa fell unconscious the officers who had him in handcuffs assumed he was asleep and didn‚Äôt confirm that he was breathing or feel for a pulse.\s\s- As precious minutes passed the officers laughed and joked about waking Timpa up for school and making him waffles for breakfast.\s\s- The officers pinned his handcuffed arms behind his back for nearly 14 minutes and zip-tied his legs together.\s\s- Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot dismissed the charges against the officers.I've been bringing this up for a week now.\s\shttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/tony-timpa-disturbing-video-shows-dallas-officers-joking-as-they-restrain-man-who-died/\s\sI just cant help but wonder if every killing like this got the same amount of attention would it have caused change sooner? \s\sInstead of hearing/ seeing 2-3 bad actors each year you see 12-13 I think it would have drawn more attention.Shockingly no riots.[removed]Not really the point but I'd like to point out the location of the officers knee (center of Tony's back) and the cause of death (cardiac arrest).\s\sWhen restraining someone particularly on drugs (coke in Tony's case fentanyl and meth in George's case) there are other possible causes of death than asphyxiation and crushing the larynx. \s\sI wasn't in the autopsy room but it's entirely possible his larynx wasn't crushed. A non crushed larynx also does not in any way exonerate the officer if his actions caused a different cause of death.This exposes a lot of problems both within police departments today and news/social media. \s\sPolice departments *especially* in larger cities genuinely do appear to be fraught with corruption many officers are unwilling or unable to hold each other accountable and their overseers (i.e. Democrat-run civic authorities) aren't willing to hold them accountable either. At the very least the authorities who reviewed this footage should have sacked those cops immediately and prosecuted them. Why didn't they? As if that's not enough the Baltimore PD has literally allowed known members of the effing *Klan* onto the force and looked the other way (check out the amazing stories of Daryl Davis). That's a damning indictment on whoever is running that PD and the officials who are supposed to keep it clean. \s\sAt the same time the media is making this out to be an exclusively police vs. black issue when in fact every race is susceptible to mistreatment by the police. I don't know how *anyone* is supposed to trust Dallas Police after seeing this and it's not just the brutality that should scare us but the *cover-up* the complete lack of accountability. \s\sI believe that BLM the outrage mob whatever you call them needs to broaden their view of this whole situation. Don't throw every cop under the bus but maybe consider no longer continually voting for the same people that enable the behavior of bad cops or keep them on the force when they have no business being there. At the same time we as conservatives should acknowledge that there are a lot of valid issues BLM has called attention to and we should work together to fix them.Man for how much Reddit loves to shit on conservatives I sure am seeing a lot of fair nuanced and rational discussion here.Yeah if you go to the protests you‚Äôll see they are for BLM but also for overly aggressive force by police in general. It‚Äôs just spearheaded by black killings but it‚Äôs really for us all. These protesters sitting on the ground and getting attacked could be your brother or sister. Could be your parents. Could be you one day. It‚Äôs time police are held accountable for the mistreatment of their citizens. \s\sPolice‚Äôs job is to arrest SUSPECTED criminals. Their job is not to deliver punishment prior to court hearings.Agree 100% with everything you just said except the blaming democrats. I‚Äôm not from the US but both the left and right wing seem to be so focused  on identity politics rather then fixing the underlying issues. How can you put together such a cohesive argument and then shit the bed with ‚Äúbut duh Democrat‚Äôs‚Äù clearly the issue in America is deeply rooted corruption and corporate greed enabled BY BOTH SIDES.The goals are the same but the reasons different. Fine. Just reach the goal on your own justification.\s\sPolice need to have external committee holding them accountable. \s\sWe need to train them properly which takes years. Not a crash course. \s\sWe need to reduce their insane funding and save tax payers money.BLM won't let that happen because they are more of a Marxist group then a group that wants social change. Add the fact that the cities are already in full Democrat control so in reality that don't want local change they are trying to force the hand of national government.I believe they had to fight for the body can footage for 3 years! Complete BS just like all the others.yes.  footage was not released until a fed judge made them.This also happened in Dallas. It's just like George Floyd's death except the roles are reversed (white guy black cop). No protests or public outcry. Only made local news.\s\s[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsE6\_lVkrE&t=39s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsE6_lVkrE&t=39s)big difference was - no witnesses no one filming.  \s\sthen police hid footage for years.Okay so why don‚Äôt you protest it or do you not care when cops kill people at all?Then why didn‚Äôt you go protest?Um he's white no one gives a shit about white peopleReddit gave a shit...  https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/ck8r0o/youre_gonna_kill_me_dallas_police_body_cam/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf""Tony was white.""\s\s\sTheres your answerWar is Peace\s\sFreedom is Slavery\s\sIgnorance is Strength\s\sOppression is Privilegeno the fucking difference here is that this is body cam footage taken at night with no one else around and was hidden from public view for three years.[deleted]But if a minority of protestors loot and riot then the portesting should stop. Yet we don't ask police to stop policing if a minority of them abuse their power and assault kill strip you of your rights enter your home without a warrant abuse no-knock warrants detain you illegally escalate a situation etc.\s\sWe do all agree on this. This shit shouldn't be political. And just because some people want to stay that black lives matter because they feel others don't think so doesn't mean non-black people can't march with them instead of confronting them that all lives matter. Yes all lives matter but what good does confrontation do when the real issue is that everyone to varying degrees is at risk of or has been fucked by the police unjustly? I don't need to agree on all the reasons the person next to me is protesting in order to share some common ground.\s\sMaybe if people who criticized the protests because of the looting tried protesting with the protestors against a common goal (police accountability) they may see (or maybe not) evidence of police escalating. If you don't think it happens that's fine but go and see it with your own eyes.Did you watch the video? It seems like Tony had a medical emergency. Im not sure what the officers could have doneTony didn't fit the left's/media's narrative.When your cultural identity is wrapped up in victimhood and martyrdom you get BLM.We riot?Yes. My TV is oldAs a white male victim of violent police misconduct I can attest that I have received no sympathy from either the left (""You think you have it as bad as minorities?"") or the right (""I'm sure those officers were just doing their job.""). It's great to put ourselves in others' shoes but we need to know something applies to all of us in order to really take action as a society and by making it purely a race issue we've been able to avoid the fact that we have a cop issue. As the saying goes ""If they come for me in the night they'll come for you in the morning.""So everyone here agrees that police brutality is a major problem?Major? No.\s\sBut of course its a problem. The police killed ten unarmed black people last year. I think that's less than people killed by vending machines falling down. Would you say vending machines falling are a major problem?I agree. And the media makes it worseCan any current or former cops explain to me the mentality behind these cops keeping handcuffed suspects on the ground and laying on them for long periods of time?\s\sI did loss prevention for years I would subdue and cuff shoplifters by myself. As soon as they were cuffed I would help them up and walk their asses into the store.\s\sAfter cuffing them throw them in the police car and get the hell out of there. You're less likely to injure the suspect and less likely to build a crowd around to start more problems.Conservatives need to get their fucking shit together and seriously organize against police violence and injustice demand police accountability and end Qualified Immunity for police. \s\sI know y'all say you're against police violence and injustice but for Gods sake it's time to prove it.\s\sPolice accountability now!\s\sSenator Justin Amash (Libertarian) - just put up the End Qualified Immunity Act we need to spread information about it and we need to support it!\s\shttps://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1268606685368770563?s=19Welp I guess it's time to start smashing windows and breaking shit cause we're tired of white people dying.  That's what a Democrat would do right???Facebook deleted all of the post about tony timpa even from his own family my husband worked with his dad and had met tony once or twice.White lives don't matter to blm. ObvTruth go post about Tim or any other whites killed by police in a BLM sub and watch what happens.Why don‚Äôt you go March for Tony then?Here is another one from my neck of the woods: [Kelly Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kelly_Thomas).  The murderers got away.  And another one: [In Secretive Court Hearing NYPD Cops Who Raped Brooklyn Teen in Custody Get No Jail Time](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/30/nypd-anna-chambers-rape-probation/).\s\sNo one ever seems to give a damn.\s\sBut blacks suffer more from police brutality because (1) they interact with police far more frequently and (2) an abusive cop who is also racist will be even more likely to show brutality against them.\s\sCrack down on abuse and you will also prevent racism-driven abuse.The statistics don‚Äôt support your position. Police encounter whites more than blacks. Close to 2:1. More whites are killed by police than blacks each year.If police brutality against white people matters to conservatives why aren't there any equivalent movements to BLM run by white people? Maybe the black community is wrong to claim it disproportionately affects them but no white person created an ""All Lives Matter"" movement to actually do anything. Call BLM racist all you want but they at least want to do something about police accountability.It's exactly like statistics about men getting raped. It's only brought up even people are talking about a woman who got raped.Daniel shaver.\s\sexecuted while on his hands and knees begging for his life by a police officer.\s\sAndrew Thomas Finch\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Wichita_swatting\s\sshot and killed without warning by a police officers that had surrounded the wrong house.super fucked up.  thx.\s\si try not to follow the news and didnt hear about these.and the officer that murdered him is getting pension payments for life for PTSD from shooting Daniel Shaver how sick is that and he got acquitted for murder \s\s[:/](https://youtu.be/uGYL5US0tes)I'm still waiting for the March for Tony...\s\sProtests for Tony....\s\sJustice for Tony....[removed]As long as everyone is blind the true opposition is known.Surely another big difference (other than tony timpa being white) that you also stated in your title is that there was no one else there. Where as George Floyds death was witnessed and filmed by people and so could be broadcast by the media very soon after his death. \s\sI can understand the uneasiness and disagreement (although that‚Äôs not my personal opinion) with organisations like BLM and how people are protesting. But if theses protests bring around real changes to accountability/training etc for police forces that means greater protection for everyone and even the possibility of proper investigations and consequences for historic/closed cases. Real police reform could bring justice for Tony Timpa and other white people who have suffered at the hands of police. So wouldn‚Äôt that be a good thing?So it‚Äôs a problem that affects us all. I hope to see us all protesting together against police violence abuse of power and the sociopathic nature of too many officers.This is why I find it important to protest and work towards ending police violence. Police violence hurts everyone involved regardless of race background or identity. \s\sIt is a tragedy that so many good people have had to lose their lives for the world to finally take action. The best we can do now is see the action through until we make real considerable meaningful and palpable change.Its called the police union.  As with any union it makes it very hard to do anything to bad apples.Do I have to go riot??The MSM war on white people is real. They hate us.Theyll just say "" this movement has always been about police brutality in general ""Yeah! BLM and the MSM is such a bullshit because this happens to all people of all colors! #alllivesmatter.... (huge /S) the goals are the same. Stop trying to be divisive. The last 4 years have split this country in half and the goal here is too worthy for this trite pettiness. You can help bring a change unless of course you're too much of a pussy to come out as slightly racist as well... bring change or just admit it.they laughed? man wtfI haven‚Äôt seen any you‚Äôre gonna kill me shirts...weird\*Robot's voice\* Cannot compute!Yes. The police are out of controlStatistically unarmed whites are killed far more than unarmed blacks by police . I know proportionally there are more whites but the point is it‚Äôs not automatically about race. If Mr Floyd was white this still would have happened. That cop was the issue not the whole white racehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/ck8r0o/youre_gonna_kill_me_dallas_police_body_cam/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfThen it's still in your best interest to support the protestors not the rioters. If a problem affects everyone what point is their in trying to get victim privileges instead of just fixing the issue?The problem with the police system isn't racism it's police brutality. The media only shows you incidents involving black victims.Huh a mentally ill white guy is asphyxiated to death while all the cops joke and laugh at him.   Despite the painfully descriptive photography the story never breaks.\s\sPlease tell me more of this racismHonestly if you watch the video its definitely not as bad as the George Floyd one. They just had a knee on his back and didnt seem to be abusive. I dont think these cops should go to jail but they should be better trained fo deal medical emergencies.""not as bad"" spoiler alert if you didn't finish the video but he fucking died. being held in that position for for more than a few minutes will most likely kill you whether their weight is on your head or your chest especially when it's three overweight cops.\s\sedit: grammar[removed]i just learned about this last night.\s\s- made a big post to my fb something never do.  im not one of ""those people"".\s\s- making plans to write several state officials on this on a regular basis.\s\s- made this post here.\s\syour attempt to be condescending says more about you than it does me.What a shit law. I hope this is struck down and this man isn't sent to the poor house for attorney fees. Texas should be ashamed.That is messed up. SCOTUS should 100% strike this down.This is set for a jury trial on May 20 2019. \s\sI'm not sure exactly how many e-mails were sent to the officers in question but from what I've been able to gather it was numerous. The defendant went off on them like a crazy ex girlfriend and sent lots of e-mails even after being cautioned. \s\sHe is an attorney in Texas and to some extent should be held to a different standard but that standard should come from the Attorney Discipline agency of Texas whatever that is. \s\sBasically it boils down to did he send enough obnoxious e-mails to the accounts of the deputies to be harassing with the intent of harassing them?Well F the 1st amendment then! I expect this kind of behavior from California. What's going on in Texas?California moved to Texas for jobs lower cost of living and lower taxes.  They then voted as if they were still in California.""  which makes it a crime to send ‚Äúannoying‚Äù \s\sThrow the book at him.I understand if you are investigating known drug dealers or make a bust and seize property used while in commission of an actual felony crime. \s\sBut stopping rando's for minor traffic violations and taking their money because it might have been used in a crime.....while letting the person go? It's nothing more than highway theft with a badge. Might be an unpopular opinion but this is an issue where I don't support LEO or legislators who refuse to address this.\s\sCivil asset forfeiture is highway robbery. Change my mind.I guess its legal so...That‚Äôs an atrocious idea. Thank goodness you all have firearms. I fear for your future I do not trust the current president or anyone else who could become president with that power. Shame on any so-called ""conservatives"" who support this flagrant violation of our constitutional rights. Isn't this unconstitutional? Habeas corpus?[deleted]second that> Mapp signed the order Monday in preparation for Hurricane Irma. The order allows the Adjutant General of the Virgin Islands to seize private property they believe necessary to protect the islands subject to approval by the territory‚Äôs Justice Department.\s\sUm what?  Since when could you just 'seize' private property? Eminent domain is bad enough but this sounds beyond the pale to me.The sentence is actually lenient by Sharia standards....rejection of Islam (apostasy) is traditionally punishable by death (The ""prophet"" as recorded in the Hadith of Bukari: ""Whoever discards his Islamic religion kill him"").\s\sWhat will likely happen is that - unless this man recants and re-embraces Islam he will be killed in prison or will be murdered by a ""righteous"" Muslim immediately upon completion of his sentence. Something similar happened in Pakistan in the 80s....an air-force officer converted from Islam to Christianity was imprisoned for months for his apostasy but because of the subsequent international outcry he was released. Within minutes of his release right outside the courthouse he was shot to death by a vengeful Muslim.\s\sLeftists like to obfuscate the issue of Islamic intolerance by insisting that corrupt governments are to blame....but in fact such intolerance is a culture-wide phenomenon that includes the ethics and proclivities of private citizens.Two points:\s - Both the USA and Canada support Saudi Arabia buy buying their oil.  North America needs to get energy independent.  - Islam is not compatible with the freedoms that are related to Western society. Islam is stuck in the 700s not the 2000s.>Weren‚Äôt they already doing this though? I‚Äôve seen Snowden interviews where he explained this years ago.\s\sNo. What they did there was like any other thief to crack the encryption. Encryption however by design does not allow a backdoor because there is no way you can secure messages between two people - that is the idea - while having some third party to also listen to the conversation. If you put in a backdoor you put the whole encryption up to being able to being hacked by a malicious hacker. Just look at the [history of Pay TV Channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_encryption#Digital_cable_and_satellite_television_encryption). They all have been hacked because they all had to use the same key for every user. And there were millions of users.\s\sFor Government look up the [Clipper Chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip). It was a desaster.\s\sAnd think more about it: Can you trust the Government for example not to bankrupt you by intercepting you managing your bank account and transferring all your money elsewhere? Think ***Cancel Culture***. No because Online Banking is reliant on encryption. A thief could do the same and in neither way you could prove it wasn't you. And then you are broke. Enryption needs to be absolutely safe between the people who know and want to communicate. Otherwise no one can trust anything.This also essentially violates any rights to privacy as it would make encrypted communications that don't have a backdoor illegal or at minimum suspicious to the point of being directly attacked or decrypted through force.\s\sThis also negates the security that encryption brings that what was sent is what was received. Signed encryption ensures that both the sender/receiver cannot be spoofed and that the content was not tampered with.  Backdoors would remove this inherit functionality and could lead to evidence planting and ""man in the middle"" attacks to modify data on the fly completely transparently.Exactly you can't leave a door open and not expect someone malicious to sneak their way in. It's adding a single point of failure to a system that is otherwise impenetrable. It'll definitely do more harm than good.Gotta crack down on thought crime'Don't be evil' ....""Are we the baddies""\s    - google engineersThis certainly seems improper!Soooo... This means Comey perjured himself...? Right?Yea but he didn't *intend* to perjure himself so it's ok!Bad (or sick) guys!Well now we know why the FBI was so damn squirrelly during the election cycle - Clinton Inc. had the goods on them and so many people were at risk of losing their jobs if stuff like this got out but there were so many crimes going on you couldn't keep a lid on everybody.\s\sIt was like a never-ending 4th Amendment violation party in the Obama Admin and it looks like they got **at least** the FBI NSA and CIA all down in the mud together. A _lot_ of people needed Hillary to get elected to keep this quiet.The silence from the Left Wing media on this one is deafening. Shouldn't this story backed with actual evidence be the biggest story on every news program?So Le Pen is going to win then? The first round? Probably. Bit too early to tell for the second round but it isn't looking likely. Her best chance is M√©lenchon or Fillon comming in second but even against Fillon she is more than 15 points behind for the second round.\s\sAt this point it's Macron's to lose as long as he makes it to the second round.\s\sWhen her father made it to the second round a decade and a half ago he lost the second round by 60 point. She'll do way better but the Front National continues to have very little crossover appeal for voters from other parties. The only way a conservative wins this I think is if Fillon and le Pen both make it to the second round. In that scenario Fillon probably wins and arguably he is the most fiscally conservative of the four players who are in contention.The mainstream elements of 'liberal media' ignored most of the NSA disclosures and the little attention they spent was largely on Snowden as a person like suggesting he was a foreign operative. Based on that (and other leaks that occurred under Obama) I don't think they 'benefit from the leaks' except when they believe they can spin the leaks into a narrative they want to spread; and even then - I wouldn't expect them to make solid criticism of the system itself. These people are insane.How long until the German people revolt? Do you think Merkel will let it devolve to that? Start with politicians. Turn over all those rocks before you focus on the commonwealthI hope they are watching antifa but knowing those losers they are putting all their resources to making Trump look bad.Not supporting any violent group but antifa is not an organization.

Well during the cookout after the man had started drinking he takes us over to show off his massive collection of not only weapons but all his survival equipment. This is just a normal looking guy living in a normal neighborhood. I would have never in my wildest dreams imagined he would have such a massive stock pile of weapons in his back yard. I mean guns of all types shotguns automatic weapons knifes you name it he has it. The place was jammed packed with weapons ammunition and survival gear. He was as you say just chomping at the bit for an excuse. He rambled off about how he can not wait for a civil war to start and how any day the president would call them to take up arms.

Such a shitty position to be in.It amazes me you can get charged for a service you never asked for and were bit even awake to refuse. It's like somebody calling for 200 pizzas to your house while you slept and you being legally required to pay for them.Over here in Europe employers pay a percentage of their employees' wages in order to be insured non-negotiable.\s\sThat means that almost any medical services and certainly all emergency ones barring transplants are free for the insured person.

Not because he owed money for medical bills.\s\sWe don't have debtors' prisons or workhouses anymore.\s\sEditted answer. There are more than bankruptcy and ruined credit that are just two results of unpaid medical bills. A person's quality of life their emotional and mental well being to state a few.I mean there are for profit prisons were the prisoners are practically forced to work(If you chose not to you‚Äôre put in solitary until you change your mind) without pay or with extremely low wages in some states these wages are less than 2 dollars a day or 23 cents an hour. Fun fact: Walmart AT&T Kmart Honda McDonald‚Äôs and Pfizer all use prison labour and in the past Victoria‚Äôs Secret and Starbucks have also used prison labour every single license plate in the US is made with prison labour.\s\sThe 13th amendment:Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.We certainly do have debtor's prison today. Lose your job and can't pay your child support? Send your ass to jail.I agree with the other points but stating the worst that can happen is bankruptcy and ruined credit is oversimplifying it.TLDR:  (they didn't go to court to prove they couldn't pay which is required every 3 months).\s\s&#x200B;\s\s \s\sthat law was put in place at Hassenplug's own recommendation to the local judge. The attorney uses that law by asking the court to direct people with unpaid medical bills to appear in court every three months and state they are too poor to pay in what is called a ""debtors exam.""\s\sIf two hearings are missed the judge issues an arrest warrant for contempt of court. Bail is set at $500.\s\sHassenplug said he gets ""paid on what's collected."" If the bail money is applied to the judgment then he gets a portion of that he said.\s\s""We're sending them to jail for contempt of court for failure to appear"" Hassenplug said.And poor people who miss work to spend part of the day in court end up losing their jobs anyway. \s\sI've been to various courts and it's always sitting around for hours waiting for the judge to get around to your case. If you're lucky you'll only lose half a day of work.Article says the man was jailed for failing to appear in court. Am I wrong or is that not an arrestible offense? Not sure I see the rage here.Failure to appear twice. The title is very misleading.I've heard they sometimes throw the summons in the trash as a scare tactic in dealing with unpaid bills. They can't arrest you for debt so they get you for failure to appear.Yes it's that they passed a law requiring appearances every 3 months in person.  For someone working poverty wage jobs having a whole day off sometimes two of the docket is full will get you fired or make a noticable difference in pay.Ppl just read titles not articles usuallyIt is one thing to owe someone money but you can't just ignore the courts. If we allowed people to just not show up to court then the whole judicial system falls apart.Coffeyville Kansas is the single worst shithole in America.

That's the legislature's job.""the law""  allows the judge to suspend medical  payments if the family can prove they are indigent (poor).  but when you skip 2 court appearances (to prove you can pay) you get arrested.\s\s\-reading is hard.Tres Biggs went to jail for failing to appear in court for unpaid medical bills. He described it as ""scary.""¬†\s\sFailing to appear in court can result in jail time. Failure to pay medical bills most likely isn't the cause of jail time here. If I had to guess the debt owed was being transfered to a collections agency and was required to be presented before a court of law and the pitiful bunch probably threw the summons in the same pile as all their unpaid bills and neglected to open it. \s\sNot really rage inducing. Just pitiful. Hope they get their shit sorted out.The court requires them to come in once every 3 months to say that they're too broke to pay medical bills. If they fail to appear twice IIRC they go to jail and have to pay $500 cash bail.

In jail for failure to appear in court multiple times for court summons. It doesn't matter if you're summoned to court for a thirty dollar parking ticket or for running over a playground of children; you get a summons you appear in court. Doesn't matter if you agree with it or not.\s\sThe fact the doctor is abusing the law in this manner to make folks appear every three months to state their too poor and the judge that is supporting it is a different conversation. Honestly a conversation in which the judge should be removed for judicial misconduct and abuse of his power and the doctor should have his license revoked for doing harm and abusing his patients.Poor people who miss work to spend part of the day in court end up losing their jobs anyway.\s\sI've been to various courts and it's always sitting around for hours waiting for the judge to get around to your case.

What the fuck.[deleted]Torture to some fetish to others. Jesus Christ 2 hours before calling an ambulance and four different officers tased him multiple times each? Jesus Christ I'm not sure if even manslaughter is a heavy enough charge for these monsters. It's torture and premeditated murder. They had him safely restrained and *then* they stomped on his head tased him dozens of times (including in the testicles) and inflicted enough trauma to render a healthy young man brain-dead. There are some sick motherfuckers in that department. lets be honest we'd be lucky if they see unpaid vacation""I just want them to say they fucked up"".\s\sChrist. Poor parents.In that 24 second audio where the officer said he would kill Graham if he didn't calm down the poor kid starts screaming ""where am I?!"" The kid is having a bad trip and here he's being restrained and shocked. Of course he's freaking out. He might as well be a wild animal in the back of that cruiser. And their answer is to torture and threaten the kid with his life. Well they succeeded... That was a difficult read...I knew this guy indirectly. There's a lot of people that want blood or at least some justice. Unfortunately none will likely be hadAnd then they wonder why some guys snap and kill a lot of police officers. I'm out of words.I'm sure it's not over for the family. They won't forget this ever. The result of spending over a trillion dollars fighting the war on drugs.Don't you feel safe? As former law enforcement I blame the officers.  They're bullies.  I got high and did drugs for a while growing up.  I did acid multiple times.  I got clean and have been so ever since.  \s\sI got into law enforcement and had a pretty decent career.  My history of drug use which I never hid from prospective employers kept me from joining the FBI even though I was encouraged by members of my chain-of-command to apply.  I didn't bring down any Madoffs Capones or Escobars but I led my department in saves one year and never had my testimony or evidence flipped by a defense attorney because I was sloppy or a shitbag.  I went out of my way to be fair to everyone treat every person I encountered with respect be they homeless or highly-compensated individual in a suit.\s\sThese assholes in blue will cost their agency a shit-ton of money and that in turn will come from the taxpayers.  Hiring assholes means a loss of taxpayer dollars.  \s\sIf officers can't do the right thing performing their jobs e.g. not bullying people not lying and destroying lives through cruelty and wanton disregard for the well-being of **ALL** of the citizens they claim to protect then they will cost their agency and town / city / county / state / country money.  The fact that it took the FBI to get in these yahoos shit to get something done means all the agencies in between had their hands in this turd sandwich and **none** of them did the right thing costing the taxpayers at every step of the way.\s\sShitbags are expensive at every level be it private sector or government.Hey thanks for doing a job cleanly it is distasteful but it needs to be done. Worse yet for all your efforts to be above board and fair all of it is for waste when 3 or 4 fuckups out of 70 just keep treating people like shit. At some point the good officers are going to start to realize their code of blue protecting those people is bleeding them dry of respect in the community.The original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/66xk20/police_torture_teen_after_he_takes_lsd_and_end_up/) \s And the audio recording of the [dashcam](https://soundcloud.com/austinamericanstatesman/dashcam-audio-of-graham-dyer-arrest)This is horrifying I can't imagine what he must have been thinking and going through in his last hours especially since the LSD lasted most likely until his death. What a terrifying way to spend your last final hours. He was so confused. [removed][removed]So the FBI has obscured the images of the officers in their own footage in an attempt to save them from being singled out by the parents? In any other institution this would constitute as major fraud why are the police above it? Jesus fuck I'm cryingI'm crying just from reading it I'm honestly not sure if I can handle listening to the audio.That poor lad. My heart breaks for his parents. Hope they get the justice they deserve.Officers should be summarily executed for abusing their power and all police records should be available for the public. That would weed out these monsters in a heartbeat.Oh god damn it why does everything bad happen have to happen in Texas.It's literally an authoritarian state here. Run and stay faaaaaar away.Cops in Texas has ALWAYS sucked when I was touring with bands and traveling for shows I was always warned about the cops in Texas Florida CA and Louisiana. 4 chan can find some douches throwing bottles but they can do the reel justice of the sea.After watching this video truely hope the cop that tased his groin never has a good night sleep until he comes foreward and admits his wrongs. Knowing Texas though he never will.How long does on study to become a cop in Texas 6 months? \s\sJesus fucking christ.It doesn't require training to not torture people. The police forces are OK with this they recruit horrible people and protect them because they are rotten from top to bottom. Give me one good reason as to why these cops don't deserve death.""armed man robs hot dog vendor""Police let the perpetrator walk free.He's probably just trying to get back all his lunch money that got taken from him when he was a little bitch at school. Or he was the one taking the lunch money.I was thinking what if he didn't sell much before this and he just happened to have $100 cash on him for just personal reasons. \s\sThey should have to prove the money they take was from doing the illegal thing. I know he needs a permit but it kills me to think that they just get to take what they want. So stealing as a cop is legal. We need new rulings.  [deleted]doing anything as a cop is legal when everyone has the mentality of ""just fight it in court""His penalty should be decided in court by a judge. To just take his money like that is a complete abuse of power.""They would have to prove...""\s\sLemme stop you right there.[deleted]Cops like this are a disgrace to the forceCivil forfeiture is such a fucking joke it's just legal theft.And getting the money back is some bullshit process the cops know it ends up going to their pocketsgetting the money back will likely cost more than the value of the money the cop stole.\s\sNobody is spending $2000 on a lawyer to challenge a $200 seizure....and the cops know it.Cop should have just written a ticket...Only problem is the cop doesn't know where the money comes from the guy was operating without a permit.Serve and protect?To serve and profit.How does the cop know all the money in the guy's wallet is from selling hot dogs??They don't but you can't prove otherwise so they take it all assuming that it is because they can.He just has to claim a reasonable suspicion that the money is the product of illegal activity.\s\sAnd the hotdog guy is not in trouble and will not be charged. (Or doesn't have to be to keep the money. No charges? No problem they can still keep the money.) The *money* is charged.\s\sThere will be a civil case labeled something very close to ""State of California vs One Hundred Dollars.""This is the equivalent of taking a child's money for selling lemonade. They act as if the surrounding businesses are going to be upset over this. Fuck 12Believe it or not it is the same thing What happens to the money?Most asset forfeiture seizures are on paper partnered with a federal agency which will let the local agency keep something like 90% or whatever of the amount seized.\s\sSo what happens to the money? It goes to the department. Some departments use forfeiture proceeds to pay overtime some throw parties and buy expensive espresso machines.\s\sIt's policing for profit quite literally.And that's why we sell drugs in the shadows*cough* pig *cough*The new rule of law is 'guilty until proven innocent'.  Allows for civil forfeiture and killing unarmed innocent men because cops are 'scared'.  This is the same innaccurate title used when this video was posted in r/latestagecapitalism. The hot dog vendor didn't have a permit UC police were called about it so they have to address the situation. I don't know where the hell he got off taking the money but it has nothing to do with civil forfeiture. [deleted]greedy pig.Downvoting. Cop clearly states that his reason is the guy doesn't have a permit those things exist for a reason this guy could be making people sick.\s\sEdit: nonetheless I agree the cop doesn't know where the money came from. However if it did come from the hot dog stand I would support them taking it under civil forfeiture the guy shouldn't earn money for illegally preparing food.\s\sEdit 2: I realise the cop keeps talking about critical thinking and ofc all of the guy's money comes from the hot dog stand so it's all illegal money that said the cop can't prove that but in the end justice is done in a way.REALLY question how many street vendors or food carts have made you sick? Better yet search your local news heck national news come back please share all the instances of food poisoning from small business with or without a permit?\s\sLike that food truck Chipotle right?\s\sOr the many food recalls of stuff sold from food trucks right? Like the bagged spinach those darn people without the right paper work.\s\sIf you are ACTUALLY worried about getting sick from food trust me a food truck/cart is about the LEAST of your worries. People owning those can't afford to make people ill it would kill their rep and thus their business. The guy owning the cart could never defend himself in court if he served up food that put people in the hospital.\s\sBut hey you clearly know more than me.\s\sAlso when it comes to the issue of money I hope at some point you get to experience some good ole civil forfeiture yourself. Then you can come whine and cry about how it is unfair and you can't make ends meet. We will just repost your own words to you -  ""but in the end justice is done in a way.""\s\sAssholeWhere did this happen? The truth comes from facts. If we can establish where it came from that area can be avoided. Also this can be brought to the publics attention there.Did you not watch the video? Why are you mad for cops doing their jobs? I'm guessing he didn't have a vendors license and could seriously get someone sick. It's standard to seize their money right?Are you kidding me?? One cop finally decides to not be an asshole and now he's a criminal?? Jesus this country is just shit sometime.Ah the classic we investigated ourselves and found nothing wrongOf course.

Yes fundamental changes need to be made broadly but those who do wrong need to be punished for behavior to actually change. Sad to see it's not even being recognized as a problem without outside influences raising a stink.Trash article. Incredible bias.

She's not a good person. Wake the hell up. Noone is saying shes a saint. Regardless that shes guilty and deserves to rot in prison their are rules and procedures that need to be followed. Even criminals are entitled to those procedures. Is she a peice of shit? Absolutely but the police did some fucked up shit aswel if this was am i the asshole i wpuld say everyone is an asshole hereDoes that mean she deserved that treatment? I see them as separate events. People attack the character of victims all the time but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the police are wrong for their actions.Even criminals have basic human rights.Yea I was about to point all this out too.

Its case by case but you typically just are required to use your corrective lens.\s\sI'd be a bit more upset about the police brutality....This is very clearly a situation in which officers couldn't handle someone questioning their authority then creating charges to match. I wish her luck but with our legal system and blind faith in the police her life is probably over.She got convicted of her charges in 2019. A firefighter called 911 after she almost hit him then she entered into a high speed pursuit with cops and the video of it was played in court.The title describes sexual assault.

I have a feeling it's a lot easier to knock politely and wait for someone to open up.\s\sNotice also that for this trip none of the police appear to be armed.  They brought enough people in case a fight broke out but they're not expecting any real resistance.Bunch of gutless pricks.

And it's a bit ironic that SJWS and rad fem are perpetuating it after all the sobbing about it.I guess ""raping up"" is the new form of ""punching up.""This is what rape culture looks like when is supported by SJW'ers.\s\s\s\s\sIt's more important to attack and trash a White woman than talk about rape perpetrated by POC.This shit is precisely why Trump is winning and the French are going to elect Le Pen. Congratulations regressive leftists. Exactly. And yet all they do is double down and scream about how evil the populist demagogues are. They take no responsibility whatsoever for what's happening.What's that? SJWs victim blaming a woman? I thought that was our job.They're also harassing her utteirng death threats etc. All the stuff they constantly accuse others of doing. But hey they're in good company radical Muslims aka salafists and other Muslims who feel ""attacked"" by her are joining in. It's vile business.It's just 3rd party trolls. \s\s>The video went viral and was viewed nearly a quarter of a million times. Selina eventually saw it on the Facebook page of an Islamic preacher who has been described as radical in the German media. She tells SWR Fernsehen she became frightened wondering ‚ÄúWhat if someone sees who believes it or has a radical background?‚Äù She began getting threatening calls at work and people were attacking her on Facebook as a racist and a right-winger.\s\sThis really does highlight how messed up the situation in Germany's become. When the Germans themselves express fears of speaking out or expressing anything that runs contrary to the self-flagellating and ideological narratives being shoved down their throats.Its a sad state of affairs. Most people who grew up in Germany i know are normal people. But as soon as national pride or ""oppressed people"" are involved they get all sweaty and do everything to not come off as racist. It's been that way in Australia for years we lead the world in ""multiculturalism"" because the public were effectively gagged and couldn't complain.\s\sLike France and Germany our most of our major cities are now divided up by nationality or religion it's not multicultural it's just segregation. Germans are deadly afraid of speaking their minds. For good reason.\s\sReddit always wonders why Germans hold their privacy in such high regard. It is cause they know everything will be used against them by a brutal and unforgiving machine called the state if it isn't private anymore. Not having freedom of speech nor freedom of self defense does that to a population.It just makes me really really sad not even angry anymore. There are people still alive that fought for freedom and we're throwing it away like it's worthless. [deleted]>This really does highlight how messed up the situation in Germany's become.\s\sGermany? I don't think this has anything to do with the German situation in particular. Do you think the situation would be any different in the US? As I see it Germany is still better off here.\s\sWhat do you think would happen if someone in the US would go on national media to talk about a huge sex scandal in which that person claims to have been molested by racial minorities? There would be no problems with that in the US right?\s\sAs I see it you can expect the exact same reaction by a radical and vocal left wing fraction in pretty much every civilized country there is. That's not a good thing. But there is nothing special about Germany here.The threats were probably made by 4chinz and the GamerGoob Brigade!!!!111Fascism rears a new head.The question is: would they call her a racist if she weren't white? They absolutely hate Ayaan Hirsi Ali despite her growing up in Somalia and being a victim of infant FGMNo they'd call her an uncle tom house nigger or some other variant of a racial slur.Ayaan Hirsi Ali is black and critical of Islam (she was a Muslim before becoming an athiest). SJWs HATE her. So no her race doesn't matter to them in this instance.Depends on where that minority woman would fall on the oppression scale.They'd just say it's internalized racism and keep blaming herSo who's *actually* threatening women and for what?""STOP SAYING YOU WERE RAPED BY MUSLIM MEN YOU RACIST ISLAMOPHOBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE CURRENTLY MORE OPPRESSED THAN YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!""An interesting mix apparently according to German sources. The Left some Liberals and Progressives basically the people harping on about how oppressed and persecuted they are by threats aswell as Salafists and Muslims who are angry at her for speaking up. \s\sAll the stuff they accuse others of doing all the nasty and terrible things? They're doing them. Hell they're going ""Yes stuff is bad BUT it's just as bad that you guys predicted it and expected it to happen!"" also. 2016 was the year I realized  western feminists didn't care as much about actual rape culture as they do tits in video games.[deleted]Well you're a bit late to the party but we still have some hats if you'd like one.\s\sCheers!You are confusing ""care"" with what they think they are allowed to say.  They know without any doubt what happens to unbelievers.  They are scared of each other not us.  They're cultural Marxist's. L whether they realize it or not. Once you go from that understanding it all makes sense and the seeming hypocrisy vanishesEveryone knows only white people commit rape. Rape = sex + power and only cis white men have powerHorseshoe theory Poe's law whatever you call this it's unbelievableI think I'll call it /pol/'s law for now on.I used to think the situation there's implausible. But when the most dominant voices in academia and media there keep trying to demolish any semblance of nationhood culture and old-liberal values in favor of their ""progressive/enlightened"" narratives (especially the ones that insist people have no control over their own destinies or it's inevitable and thus pointless to resist) crap like this was nigh bound to happen as harsh as it sounds.This isn't Poe as Poe suggests there is a questionable appearance to the actions or professed beliefs if a group.  This is real very real and not Poe. You got to be shitting me.What happended to ""listen and believe""?""STFU racist"" seems to trump itThey're also harassing her utteirng death threats etc. All the stuff they accuse others of doing all the upvotes in the German media.i love how everyone is called a sexist and racist now no matter which side you choose or what you say..... the terms have lost all meaning.     \s\si say..... just sit back and let all of them destroy each other.  \s\sSJWs vs terrorists vs feminists vs racists vs the corrupt media...... it's free for all mode!The unfortunate thing is people minding their own business like the females assaulted on NY are the ones that end up suffering the most.They won't destroy each other though they will destroy your country that's the goal[deleted]This is very interesting thank you.\s\sYou should make a thread about the press censorship in India.I remember my (non-Indian) friend flipping out about this bias in NYT reporting on India... decades ago.\s\sThe narrative is long-standing and the international media class is the same almost wherever you go.What's dumb is pakistan commits so many more atrocities against its people pakistan being a muslim country. Child marriage honour killings public stoning the list of barbaric actions goes on... while India has some bad places due to its size overall it is not this bad.God... That's just painful on so many levels that I have trouble comprehending how horrible it must be for that poor lady having her life shattered several times in less than two weeks.Absolutely fucked up. I honestly have no idea how it has gotten this bad. I just can't wrap my head around the unfortunately widespread mindset that pretends to be for women's rights except when Muslims are against these rights. \s\sFor all the talk about rape culture (which didn't exist in the US for example) when actual undeniable rape happens feminists side with the rapist as long as the rapist has enough Oppression-Points^TMIt's the Victimlympics and the judges just go against all facts like that one  South Korean boxer.Holy shit has gone the way of like Sandy Hook Truthers?\s\sLike do people don't believe the mass assault took place and the victims coming forward are just faking pushing an anti-immigration agenda?They don't actually deny it completely (yet). What they say is this:\s\s1. Nothing new just typical German rape culture. People only care for racist reasons.\s\s\s2. There were some actual victims but there are many false victims now for racist reasons.\s\s\s3. The whole thing happened but it was an organized conspiracy by an unknown party to further tensions between muslim immigrants and non-muslims.Here have the MRA dean esmay https://twitter.com/deanesmay/status/686173924376375296 sharing his wisdom why we shouldn't believe there was anything going on in Cologne\s\s> They have no video. They're liars. Jim you are a fucking liar. And a disgusting bigot. Some at least make this point. Have you ever watched we need to talk about sandy hook? And this post as of this time [is nowhere to be seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/duplicates/40wh4e/cologne_sexual_assault_victim_called_a_racist_and/) on /r/worldnews or /r/feminism. If the rapists were Christian this wouldn't have happened. If the rapists were Hindu this wouldn't have happened. If the rapists were fucking Buddhists this wouldn't have happened. Why the fuck is Islam the exception?Are you new? It's the Oppression Olympics. A blonde white woman sexual assault victim or not does not earn as many points as a refugee that also happens to Muslim. The only thing that tops that is a disabled African American lesbian. because something something ""islamphobia"".This is disgusting and these people need to be throat punched. These social justice types always winge on about ""rape culture"" well it turns out that the only places actual rape culture exist in modern nations is with them.[deleted]Isn't that the best? People didn't care about their *perceived* rape culture so they've come to the conclusion that we only care about *actual* rape culture because we get to be racist in the process. In other words ""you weren't outraged about what happened in our fantasy land so your outrage about what happens in reality land is insincere.""\s\sThese people are either being paid or are impressively deranged.I wouldn't really label the people that think like that college kids. Most college students see the problem in that. You're looking for the sjws unfortunately ladies the sort of guy who can and would protect you from this you have brow beaten for so long about his ""Toxic violent masculinity"" that he has tuned you out or doesnt want to step into that shit heap for his own reasons.\s\sfeminists seem to be experts at harming women. remove the guard and expose them to the full horrors of the scum of society and the dangers of extreme lifestyles. \s\sno skin off my nose.you mean like that ""we need a curfew for men"" bullshit that was posted awhile ago?\s\sthat's sure to go over well...She could have protected herself if her government hadn't disarmed her.Is feminism really abdicating its duty to protect female victims of sexual assault?sjw feminists are exploding inside where the is listen and belive discourse?Being a rapist is less reprehensible than being a racist. If you had told me ten years ago that this is where we were headed I would laughed. Oh how I would have laughed. And now? I am laughing for an entire *DIFFERENT* reason.Remember how SJWs excuse abusive behavior from ""underpriviledged classes"" as ""punching up?""  I guess ""raping up"" is now a thing as well...The progressive stack is last-to-first and ""p"" comes before ""c"". Always believe the victim because women NEVER make these things up unless she's accusing someone with more oppression points then she's a lying cunt.\s\sI think there are people in the social justice movement who genuinely believe that just like when a white man is falsely accused of rape he should confess anyway to try to be a good ally or whatever if a white woman is raped by a sufficiently marginalized minority she should just shut up and take it to ""do her part"" for the cause or at least accuse a white man instead of her actual attacker.\s\sThis is just the natural conclusion of seeing people as categories instead of individuals.  They're not weighing the harm to PEOPLE in terms of ""this woman was raped"" (a major harm) vs ""this rapist was reported"" (no harm actually a social positive presuming the right man is caught) they're weighing the harm to CLASSES in terms of ""whiteness as a monolithic institution had something bad happen to one of its members"" (barely a scratch to ""whiteness"" as a whole) vs ""there could be blowback against many innocent muslims"" (a potentially great harm to muslims as a whole).  Only these ""wholes"" are bullshit so their logic is bullshit.Funny I don't think I would have considered myself a racist 12 months ago. With all the shit that has been going down the last few years and travelling to a few 3rd world countries myself I am 100% certified racist.My friend was a liberal went to work as a bar waitress in the Netherlands for a year got multikulted returned really racist against Moroccans.Man you aren't racist.

Trump 2016.But this is about SOCIAL JUSTICE!!!I'm not particularly fond of Anti-Islamic messages or groups but it pisses me off that so many people and agencies are lumping everything that's going on in Germany in the same group as those really hateful bigots.\s\sI mean for fuck's sake the woman claims to have been sexually assaulted I thought these people could do no wrong in the eyes of the wider media or the SJW movement? Or are they now saying that such protection comes with provisions now? Like a real proper mafia. Lol.\s\sSeriously though this is disgusting behaviour towards someone who has been victimized. Sure enough the attackers are innocent until proven guilty but that doesn't mean she's guilty of anything for identifying who they may have been.

""Not all black people are criminals""  ""We have to feel sorry for the black people because of stuff that happened 150 years ago"" ""It's racist to talk about our violent criminal problem stop being a bigot""  Why is it so accepted to talk about Europe's criminal problem but not accepted to talk about America's criminal problem especially since they are so similar?  Actually America's criminal problem is worse because the people committing the crime are citizens whose family has lived here for many generations.Wait... So SJW's are victim blaming a woman? What if she was a minority? \s\sThe snake is swallowing it's own tail now.Only white people can be racist[deleted]It's news that would be censored from /r/news because it's against the narrativeCensorship stories that are anti narrative end up here because they are frequently censored else where. One of the major foundation things is the anti censorship (almost fundamentalist). Because it's about ethics in journalism.\sBecause /r/worldnews /r/europe and other related subs are actively censoring this content.  Most of the stories that involve migrant sexual assault get locked within minutes (I've submitted a couple myself and witnessed this first-hand) - the excuse given by the mods is that it's a ""local issue"" and thus not suitable as /r/worldnews content.  So people submit it here instead since KiA is one of the few places on Reddit where the content won't get censored AND has a decent chance of hitting the front page.\s\sSo strangely enough a subreddit that used to be focused on game journalism ethics has turned into a ""safe-space"" against censorship in other forms of media as well.When the article says ""southerners"" I think of Texan rednecks.\s\sMade me laugh a little.What happened to Listen and Believe? Fuckin hell m8....Why are they just calling her a racist?

First filing a lawsuit is an expensive thing to do. Even if you have a solid case you must take on the enormous burden of cost to prove your case in court. Most cases that make it to trial often don't include legal fees in the final judgement and even then the burden is on you to collect those fees back from the other party which it could take years if ever.\s\sSecond you are responsible for due diligence before getting the courts involved. You have to prove to a judge or jury that you made every possible attempt in good faith to resolve this matter before litigation. They are often not kind to people who file frivolous lawsuits without seeking a resolution first.\s\sThat is why Selina (hopefully under the direction of an attorney) contacted the maker of the video and threatened him with a lawsuit before filing it likely in hopes to have the video removed and/or an apology or correction be issued. Obviously that last part didn't happen.Wut.\sI'll say it louder. Wut? Wut? Wut? Wut the fuck?how about i don't give a shit about your race if your a horrible person you are a horrible person no matter what your skin color or nationality is.Ok.  I'm done.  If identifying my attacker makes me a racist then I'm a fucking racist.  Period and full stop.  Germany needs to take action about this Cologne incident. It will cause a revolt among their actual citizens if not. They've done this all very poorly. You can't pile thousands and thousands of people with different cultural ideals and beliefs into your welfare state country at once and not expect some extreme problems. It's impossible for them to integrate naturally with the large numbers and lack of desire to take on german culture. \s\sShe definitely should still sue them. Did this reach reddit frontpage?

But here we have an incident involving *actual mysoginy and rape* and the reaction of the SJW crowd has been to sweep the incident under the rug (I guess because it doesn't fit neatly within their narrative of multiculturalism and inter-sectionalism).\s\sGamerGate has also faced a lot of problems with heavy-handed moderation and censorship in other subreddits - incidentally the same phenomenon is happening in subreddits like /r/worldnews going out of their way to purge anything that might be related to migrant sexual assault.  So the stories get posted on KiA because it's one of the few places on Reddit where a story like this has a chance of actually hitting the front page.\s\sSo we're about a lot of things.  Yes ethics in gaming journalism is one of them but fighting against censorship (particularly from agenda-pushing SJWs) in both gaming *and* journalism another big part of what KiA is about.It's about ethics in journalism. So what if it started with only one topic? Things evolve they grow.A bunch of default subs were censoring this whole incident so KIA fulfilled our purpose as free speech back-up sub.\s\sNow that those default subs have stopped trying to cover this up we'd normally drop it but we're a bunch of stubborn bastards so we hate dropping anything unfinished (it's how we've spent the past 18 months systematical breaking Gawker's entire financial legal and PR system).It doesn't. Gamergate has been colonized by right-wing culture warriors. RIP Gamergate.I'm about ready to come over to Germany and beat the ever living shit out of every last male refugee and Arab scum but not before beating the fuck out of the mayor with her own pair of shoes.> every male refugee\s\sSo you're accusing all of them of rape even the ones who'd never do it? Generalization is a bad thing haven't you taken note from thrid wave feminists?[deleted]By the same token we shouldn't sweep the incident under the rug or call people that have been victimized ""racist"" simply because the suspects happen to be migrants.  The public relies upon the media and our elected representatives to keep us informed about potential threats to our safety so we can make informed judgments and decisions; interfering with that process out of fear of promoting 'right-wing' sympathy indicates that these institutions may have a serious problem with their political priorities...Guess it's time to get banned from some sub-reddits. I saw the video in question and it was very similar to those entertaining conspiracy uncovering videos you find on YouTube.\sGermany is currently undergoing a massive circlejerk where everyone who was sceptical of accepting refugees feels confirmed in their beliefs.\sGermany also has a lot of left-wing nut-jobs (where I suspect that video originated) and a history that has politicians weary of blaming minorities.\sNow those politicians are also highly incompetent in dealing with such sensible issues.\s\sAs a result initial statements were incredibly cautious in terms of connecting refugees to the incident. Now the sceptics instantly took that as a weakness and leverage to further their own political ambitions and leading media went on milking the sweet sells fear-mongering brings with it.\s\sAll that was needed to prevent this outbreak of spontaneous idiocy was someone in charge coming out from the beginning that yes refugees were probably involved no a few hundred drunk assholes are not a good reason to condemn all refugees/muslims (most of which are happy to be here and escaping the war) and yes we will persecute those responsible.Yeah those Muslims arrived in large groups they organized in advance because alcohol just impaired their judgment a little. It's not that they grow up in a culture that tells them that unveiled western women are sluts ripe for the taking. That's entirely unrelated I'm sure of it.> condemn all refugees/muslims\s\sThis shit again. **Nobody** is condemning **all muslims**.\s\sIt's fair to say that muslims on average are a lot more rapey than Germans and that most of the ""refugees"" Merkel invited in have no right to be in Germany or the EU however.I saw it too - it was just a woman recounting how she was sexually assaulted and accosted by a mob of migrants.  Where was the conspiracy bit you're talking about?Ah look at those downvotes!\s\sGamergate hasn't been taken over by right-wingers or anything!! /sThis story's relevance to this subreddit is tenuous at best.Hardly we're just as much anti-narrative as we are about ethics the whole reason we congregated to support the need for ethics is because SJWs are the ones perverting the journalism industry.That's because more relevant subreddits are actively censoring stories like this.  Sadly this is one of the few places on Reddit where you can post a story like this and have a decent chance of hitting the front page without worrying about an overly sensitive mod locking the thread.Article is dishonest the video doesn't call her anti Muslim but the whole media and public reaction.  \sSaid video does contain her full name yet is exactly what plenty of us have done to show unethical behavior of the gaming press: digging up strange connections (e.g. does the dude who claimed to have been working at a hotel that night work for the tv station RTL) and sloppy journalist work.  Just watch the internet video in question on your own it's titled [SELFCENSORED FOR POSSIBLE DOXXING] and come to your own conclusion.Does the video dox her? If so please remove the title from your comment.\s\sThe article does not say that the video calls her anti-muslim as you claim. Not sure why you say it does but you're the one being dishonest not the article.This subreddit is one of the many white nationalist hate groups. Don't expect any reasonably replies here./r/news and /r/worldnews are thattaway. Unless the article was censored on other subs or unless it has to do with GG nerd culture tech etc. it doesn't belong here.Apparently you've never seen the ""SOCJUS"" thread tag.Stories involving migrant sexual assault are routinely locked on those subreddits.  KiA is partially about anti-censorship - that's why they're ending up here.I just checked news worldnews and Europe. Not to any great length but a cursory search of all three have zero results at the time of this writing when searching the article's headline. Also nothing about it on their front pages despite many posts on all three having far fewer upvotes. So either no one has bothered to link this karma-magnet in the appropriate sub (unlikely) or it's being buried by the mods of those subs (likely) in the same way articles about Cologne's NYE assaults were being buried.\s\sI don't care how unrelated a story like this is (it's really not if it's being censored most everywhere else) it's more than welcome here if it can't exist in its appropriate sub.

So whaddya think?  This article & others say quite a lot ... btw not trying to force an answer/reply was just wondering.  \s\sBeen super busy today & last night too & actually don't have any coalesced thoughts worth putting down ffs.  \s\sOk maybe one: üëπ  (*So to speak!*)Saving clicks:\s\s> Chelsea Manning a former Army intelligence analyst-turned-whistleblower may remain behind bars for up to another year and face nearly a half-million dollars in fines over her ongoing refusal to testify before a grand jury about her disclosure of classified information to WikiLeaks.\s\s> A federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia on Monday denied a motion filed by Manning‚Äôs lawyers for a hearing requested to press the court to reconsider its sanctions which include jail time‚Äînot to exceed 18 months‚Äîand financial penalties that may ultimately total around $441000.\s\s> Manning has stated that she has a moral objection to testifying before the grand jury and that no amount of jail time will compel her to testify. Legally she can only be imprisoned as part of an effort by the court to coerce her into testifying. Her time in jail is not supposed to be punitive.\s\s> Her attorneys argue that she‚Äôs shown her resolve is unwavering and that the sanctions are ineffective. Thus her time in jail cannot be considered coercive an attempt to compel her testimony. U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga however says he‚Äôs convinced otherwise. On Monday he denied Manning‚Äôs attorneys the opportunity to further argue their case before the court.\s\s> ‚ÄúIn support of the Motion Ms. Manning has proffered a substantial number of financial records detailing her assets liabilities and current future earnings‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThe Court has reviewed these records and concludes based on the evidence proffered that Ms. Manning has the ability to comply with the Court‚Äôs financial sanctions or will have the ability after her release from confinement.‚Äù \s\s> Manning‚Äôs attorneys said the judge‚Äôs decision was ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù that she is currently ‚Äúdeeply in debt‚Äù and cannot work while incarcerated. Therefore they argued she cannot afford the fines that may ultimately be imposed.\s\s> ‚ÄúChelsea will remain confined for another year and will face ongoing financial hardship unless Judge Trenga or a higher court are convince of what Ms. Manning has always publicly maintained: that the sanctions imposed will never coerce her compliance and therefore are entire punitive‚Äù her legal team said.\s\s> It remains unclear as to what information U.S. prosecutors hope to attain from Manning‚Äôs testimony. Her interactions with WikiLeaks were all detailed during her court-martial six years ago and logs of her conversations with Assange are already public record. \s\s> The continued existence of the WikiLeaks grand jury itself remains a mystery given the scope of the charges already brought against Assange. No evidence presented during any previous hearings nor any publicly available to date suggest that Manning had interactions with anyone other than Assange himself.\s\s> While Manning‚Äôs imprisonment for civil contempt may not exceed 18 months she could be released earlier if the grand jury is dismissed beforehand.If the judge dismissed DNC's lawsuit against Assange why are there any charges against Assange?

0,1984isreality,conservatives,24,"So many thing wrong with this and the justification for it including tracking athletes and other scholarship holders. \s\sCollege students are adults as we are often reminded.It feels like it's ""grooming"" for the idea that people should be able to track you at all times.It's been quite awhile since I was in college but I remember the professor's often not really caring if you were there or not it only hurt you if you didn't come. There were sometimes small attendance grades but it shouldn't be the teacher or schools problem if you don't go. I can see about athletic scholarship stuff but even then this tracking is nuts horrible precedent being set.I went to a small college where in some of my classes there were 10 people or less in some classes.  If you weren't there or not prepared your prof and everyone else knew.  Prof's did and didn't care.

Authoritarians should know that by now. There will always be people willing to put everything on the line so that the truth can be revealed. You can't prosecute them all.[This article suggest it may be fake](https://www.10tv.com/article/district-post-saying-hilliard-student-suspended-over-walkout-refusal-fake) but also suggest it's real.  So confusing. \s\sEither way let's say the suspension is fake but that students really were expected to go to a commons area study hall if they didn't participate in the walk-out ... this seems wrong.  If there's a walk-out that means the school effectively shuts down for the it instead of continuing classes for kids who want to stay in class ? That does definitely seem like punishing those who don't participate and seems to be encouraging participation which would be the school being active in using kids (literally high school kids) as a political pawn.  Just seems fundamentally wrong to me. \s\sAlso the whole suspension thing seems silly ... \s\s""uhm so you mean I get to skip a day of school ?""\s\s\s  ""But young man think of the in-class lessons you'll miss and you'll return to a full day's worth of homework you'll have to do.  This is a PUNISHMENT !"" \s\s\s""uhm so you mean I get to skip a day of school ?"" To protest is to go against authority.  If students protested by leaving the school grounds during a class of their own decision it would be a protest.  But when the authority tells them to ""protest"" it really isn't a protest.  The kid in this article and others like him are the ones who are protesting.  They are being forced to further a policy that they do not believe in so they refuse to do it.  They suffer unfair consequences just for doing what they believed was right.  \s\sI also hate how teachers encourage students to go on the walk out.  Teachers are prioritizing getting students to push the teachers' political opinions over actually teaching the kids.  They cancelled learning time to 'force' students to protest a political view.  Political bias should not be a part of the classroom.  If you want to talk about gun control you can educate the students on the issue and go no further.  Don't introduce your opinion don't talk about why one opinion is better than the other and certainly don't have students go and protest for your view.  These protests aren't ""student lead"" and we all know it.  He was suspended for not going to the designated study hall for students who didn't want to participate. Students are not allowed to remain unsupervised. He was told to pick a side - for or against - and didn't want to choose either.\s\sIts a life lesson I guess - sometimes remaining on the fence has consequences.He was protesting the protest by remaining in the classroom to do schoolwork.[removed]If you wish to participate here read the sidebar rules.This is the clown that called for a ""New World Order"" in 2013- yet no one asks him what the f he's talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndC1XL4731M  \s\sBut he's in good company apparently since Dick Nixon and George Bush called for the same thing. (along with Bill Clinton and Henry K- the Washington Elite)  \s\sThe 2 ""party"" system has ruined the nationIt's bullshit.\s\sYou don't lose your money for illegally changing lanes.\s\sIf you have a kilo of coke and a bunch of money then you may forfeit it ... but not for lane-changing.Civil asset forfeiture needs to end.  Its a direct violation of the 4th Amendment as an unreasonable seizure.\s\sI have no problem with seizing assets involved in a felony - provided those assets are owned by the person committing the crime or being used by them with permission of the asset owner with knowledge of the crime.\s\sI'm also not keen on the practice of seizing peoples' homes because a renter or child is dealing drugs out of the home for example without the knowledge of the homeowner.Oh God no kidding on that second thing.  Or you have a party and one of your asshole friends has drugs on them and gets you in trouble.I don't see how asset forfeiture is constitutional. Nothing at all should be seized as being related to a crime without actually being convicted of a crime *and* that link being proven. It isn't constitutional. The government just doesn't care about whether anything is constitutional.But remember folks our intelligence agencies are *totally* on our side.It has been a recognized fear for a long time.  Empowering a government agency to interfere in the rights of citizens can help catch bad guys but what about everyone else?  The idea that one has nothing to hide if innocent has very little to do when the government has complete and total access to your whole life.  It was always the dirty underside of the Patriot Act.  Given the weaponization of the the DOJ under the Obama administration we have more to fear from our own side in some ways."

Have fun proving that the police were at fault after you kill one of them. You would think that the ridiculous lack of accountability for the police would help you understand why people might decide not to shoot. \s\sCop kills civilian = cop gets paid vacation.\s\sCivilian kills cop = civilian charged with murderThey're the fucking army what is wrong with you?Clearly this is the free market run rampant!

A revolt comes with a real cost it is not a game and if you are not willing to pay it don't start it.What is the cost we don‚Äôt get to curl up and watch Netflix?

Oh wait he posted an MLk video in favour of the rioters. Is this the most confused man on the planet?Statists would say: ‚Äúthey did not immediately obey a direct order‚ÄùI argued with a couple of those people on publicfreakout.

They would take out whoever they could and then very rapidly retreat before the soldiers had time to react and call for backup.\s\sJust leaving it out here.#JUST FOLLOWING ORDERSAs soon as they said get inside I‚Äôd have yelled ‚Äúthis is my private property.

Shooting back would have resulted in being murdered or spending your life in jail. They didn't have the numbers.On a related note exactly how barrier-blind is .45-70?  Are we talking anti-spall steel plate blind?I'm high as hell and you're about to get shotYep. Looks like tyrannical government to me. If they weren't sure if that family had weapons in the house I'm sure they'd follow them inThe fact that you will see zero police officers saying that every officer there should be put to death for this is why I'm comfortable saying that the corruption is so universal that I could never consider the death of a police officer to be unjust. They're so organized and coordinated in their evil that I could never be sure that a killing of a cop was wrong. It's actually scary how unified they are in their corrupt culture. Gives a lot of insight into how authoritarian regimes work.They should at least look the other way if these officers are killed in retaliation but they won't because us/them mentality.Another case of abuse of power and excessive force by police. When is it not OK to peacefully be on your own private property. Reckless use of force condoned by the f‚Äôd up White House Administration. They are already blaming Antifa for the destruction in MN.

Cops like that should be fired immediately and the family fired at should make sure that they get in trouble with the law for that. The family was on their fucking property. \s\sI just want it all to be over because a lot of people are behaving really terribly. Looters ‚Äúantiracists‚Äù on social media and certain police officers alike.Normally absence of evidence is not evidence of absence but when pursuit of justice is the job absence of it is proof of evil. Plenty of cops will show up to do whatever they feel is necessary to me if I go shooting pepper balls at people. Show me one cop willing to do the same to these cops. You'll find none because they're all evil.https://youtu.be/0Erg09oOpmo\sthey're culpable.Retards on both sidesNot in this video.Hahaha shits getting serious.

They quite literally ran a CIA press release and disguised it as a news story.\s\sSound familiar??\s\s> * In totalitarian dictatorships the government spy agency tells the news media what stories to run and the news media unquestioningly publish it. In free democracies the government spy agency says ‚ÄúHey buddy have I got a scoop for you!‚Äù and the news media unquestioningly publish it.\s\s> * In 1977 Carl Bernstein published an article titled ‚ÄúThe CIA and the Media‚Äù reporting that the CIA had covertly infiltrated America‚Äôs most influential news outlets and had over **400 reporters** who it considered assets in a program known as Operation Mockingbird.\s\sCIA has obviously honed their skills since then.\s\s> * This isn‚Äôt Operation Mockingbird.

Film and government (and therefore their espionage agencies by default) have always stood hand in hand. We know this from history and early iconic films from the US and Birth of a Nation to Nazi Germany.  The origins of every major film studio has a story of wealth power and corruption. And acccording to the CIA agent above many were founded by the CIA. The entire American film culture and the tradition behind all of our iconic figures from animated to real actors and actresses is all propaganda. Going back over 100 years now. This American way of life is all a lie and it has to be presented as normal for people to go along with it. It‚Äôs all a part of the death grip that capitalism has over every aspect of life.Interesting articleThe ""free"" press lolThey should have that YouTube disclaimer that they are controlled and editorialized by the US govt.This kind of stuff needs to be made more public and into a scandal or it'll never stick to themI thought this was common knowledge?

Covering his mouth and nose with a towel and with a tshirt that has the man's own urine on it because the police forbaded him from using the toilet while in custody\s5. Screaming beside his ears\s6. Slapping his head\s7. Removing his leg hair\s8. Pressing against his eyeball area\s9. Issuing threats against his family (literally ""I'm gonna get your wife and your son)\s10. Flashing his eyes directly with a flashlight\s11.

The man's son filed a complaint but was ignored this video was released by a political party today.\s\sSource: https://youtu.be/ftxfJeGDtQoKind of unrelated but I wonder how much of the police have been replaced with Chinese. \s\sTienanmen taught leaders around the world about how important it is to use soldiers that aren't from the region to commit political violence. It is now standard operating procedure in China to truck in soldiers from several provinces away to do police actions. Not saying there aren't psychopaths in the HK police but I wouldn't be surprised if some of the ultraviolence we're seeing is being done by Chinese supplementary forces.The ‚Äúit could never happen here!‚Äù mentality is strong in western nations (even as it is actively happening).The Chinese government harvests people's organs while they're still alive.

TrashWhich really highlights the institutional disfunction here.\s\sI can understand an overeager kid slapping that on his rifle because he's been reading Punisher comics and wants to go ghost bad guys.  One of the seasoned guys he works with should have smacked him and told him he was an idiot.  \s\sWhile I don't want to totally relieve him on his responsibility he had a point in his trial.  The people who hired trained and supervised him utterly failed him.Going to build an AR at some point and I'm going to avoid all of that shit being anywhere near my rifle. Don't want an Attorney pointing at it and calling it evidence for premeditation.That‚Äôs absolutely insane. That body cam footage was one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever seen. Can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt go to prison let alone thisThat video still sticks in my mind years later. I only had to read ""hotel hallway"" to know exactly which incident this is about. \s\sAbsolute crystal clear unmitigated authoritarian murder.His lawyers were geniuses (who he was able to make the city pay for) and made a case where they blamed the situation on the training he received from the police department. They even had Brailsford testify that if he had known what he knows now in hindsight he still would have pulled his trigger because that's what he was trained to do in that situation.Just because Philip Brailsford got acquitted of murder doesnt make him any less of a murderer. Charles Langely doesnt get a pass either because hes just as complicit as Brailsford even if he didnt pull the trigger himself. Shooting a man whos last words were ""please don't shoot me"" while sobbing should give him PTSD and he fully deserves it for what he did. Any other person would have gotten death or life in prison if they were in his shoes and it should disgust anyone that the systems government has set up not only allow this to happen but even rewards it‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of our own.‚Äù I heard that shit on Law and Order.

Brailsford appealed his firing from the police department since he was found not guilty. Not sure what it entailed but they made a deal to hire him temporarily and allow him to get medical retirement. So he got a retirement by the police department which is then funded by the city.\s\sCity and state governments being smaller tend to have a lot better benefits.At least veterans include unwilling participants and the men who helped liberate Europe from fascism and nazism... Ya know people I'd actually be willing to donate money to out of gratitude or empathy (in the case of those drafted into Vietnam).I remember this. I hoped this piece of shit would go to prison. Never in my wildest dreams would he get a taxpayer funded retirement for the rest of his life.

They're all fucking power tripping legally sanctioned gestapo. I've had many a poc friend been unreasonably questioned or profiled by them. Once a friend and I were on an apartment balcony quietly smoking cigarettes on a balcony at night and my friend was told to sit on the chair and answer questions. The cop then got angry and continued to ask more irrelevant questions insinuating that he was on drugs because he was ""looking into his flashlight.""Scum of the earth.Didn‚Äôt he have something written on his weapon?""YOURE FUCKED"" on the dust coverWhat kind of Jury acquits this man after seeing the video.

I might have dropped the hammer too in that situation.If you would have then you are no better than this cop and should be ashamed.I can understand as well.  It‚Äôs just a mess of a situation.  The dude‚Äôs PTSD probably came after realizing the victim was unarmed.  I‚Äôm sure he had a flickering moment of hesitation when the guy reached and stifled it only to discover he murdered a man in cold blood begging for his life.\s\sThis shit would fuck me up too[removed][deleted]chris cantwell is that you?This is a tough one to swallow because seeing that kid get shot while begging for his life was absolutely heartbreaking but I can't bring myself to have too much ill will for this man. He was responding to a call where he had very good reason to believe the suspect was armed ~~(he was firing a pellet gun into a parking lot wasn't he?)~~ and he shot when he saw the guy reaching down. It was an excessive response and in the circumstances I'm sure it was difficult for the jury to decide on the charges brought against him. But out of all the cases of police violence we've heard about this one at least makes me think that the officer could credibly have feared for his life.\s\sThere is clearly something wrong with the way police officers are being trained. They are escalating situations and hyping themselves into believing they need to respond to with deadly force. They need to be empowered to defend themselves in the line of duty but their aggressive behaviour has gotten ridiculous and incredibly dangerous. There is too little oversight and too much protection from the top and something needs to be done at the source. Until they show any interest in changing their system there absolutely needs to be pushback.\s\sBut you won't see me advocating for vigilante justice against this guy like some other people in the thread. I think he really believed the guy was reaching for a gun.\s\sI will add though that applying for a PTSD pension *because* of this shooting is in appallingly bad taste. He is ultimately the one that took a life. Even if it has affected him terribly you would think he would feel responsible enough not to claim a pension over it.\s\s(Edit: He wasn't firing into a parking lot. He did however point his pellet gun out of a window.)Once again it is shown that despite a massive amount of evidence showing that a cop is not only extremely guilty but an absolute monster people will still engage in rationalization to excuse it.Dont forget Duncan Lemp Breonna Taylor and Kelly Thomas.The small town of Galena Kansas was rampant with corruption in the early 2000s (probably still is). There was a private investigator named Jim Potts that was investigating the Galena police department. On August 26th 2003 Jim Potts allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the back of the head behind his left ear on the Shimmerhorn bridge (right above schimmerhorn creek). \s\sJim Potts was right handed and no gun residue was ever found on his hands. The police ruled his death a suicide within hours despite hisome family disputing this.\s\sAccording to Jim Potts wife Jim told her before his death ""If anything happens to me look at the Galena police department"". She said at first she laughed it off but he told her ""No I'm serious"".\s\sMy uncle Mike Fry was fishing the night of Jim Potts alleged suicide right underneath the Schimmerhorn bridge when he heard the gun shots. According to his widowed wife (who has since passed away from a drug overdose) and his brother my Uncle Richard Fry Mike told them that Jim Potts death was no suicide. \s\sMy uncle Mike Fry was later murdered by these same police officers. He was scared and holed up alone in his bathroom with a knife. The cops kicked down that door and unloaded their guns on him killing him in his own house. No one has ever faced justice for the murder of Michael Fry or Jim Potts.\s\shttps://www.joplinglobe.com/opinion/editorials/repairing-credibility-takes-action/article_956b46e6-f1dc-5ffa-a061-1423d510d922.html\s\shttps://www.facebook.com/justiceforjimpotts/posts/673488406042436David T.

Like fuck man that's exhausting and unsustainable.i hope he gets his benefits cut or that inflation makes them meaninglessness.I'm curious what the point of this article is? \s\sIt's a free(ish) country and people can choose to protest or not as they please (attempts to suppress protests by the government notwithstanding)? \s\sIt seems to me that if people choose not to protest something perhaps it's because there's nothing there worth protesting? Right? Like if someone looks back in hindsight and says ""hey I wonder why no one protested this shooting"" and they believe one was warranted they should immediately ask themselves ""Why didn't I organize such a protest when I had the chance?"" \s\sSee what I'm saying? It's like this article is trying to manufacture outrage by showing that no one cares about white victims compared to black victims. Well if they truly believe that why wasn't Reason or whomever wrote the article out there protesting this murder and acquittal when it happened? \s\sIt's like we always say about welfare. If people are truly concerned about the poor the poor will be taken care of. If they're not taken care of then that's proof that no one *actually* cares about the poor. Same holds for protests. If no one protested Shaver's murder then it means no one really cared about this specific case. Okay so what? It tells us nothing about any of the other cases that do get protested.I think the reason the comparison is being made is to say that this egregious violence endorsed by the state is more about statism and authoritarianism than it is about racism.Here it is on this thread.All the news that's ~~fit to print~~ approved by a cabal of unelected bureaucratsWould elected bureaucrats be any better?You get the people working at the newspaper aren‚Äôt elected either? So no elected official approves news.The paper of repulsion[deleted]The government trades access to officials for input on stories.Yes this is how it's always been done and in fact is usually a good thing they do. They are typically seeing if any officials want to give comments on the publication and to make sure there are no immediate national security concerns. But like you also noted even if they told the publisher they don't want that out just yet they will negotiate a later timeline or the publisher can run the story anyways. This is all standard journalism honestly and I agree shouldn't even be news.Eh it‚Äôs not really as nefarious as it seems. A lot of papers do this because they can get some officials takes on the articles which they can then put into those same articles. I get it sure seems suspect and it would sure sound a lot better if they didn‚Äôt do this but it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems at first look.Plus they're not legally required to -- they choose to do so and they're free not to.and heres where I act surprised....[deleted]link?\s\sedit:  Not that I doubt it.

Apparently not Trump's admin because they always rip him a new one hahaha""All the news that's fit to print""It is horrible but less so than in more authoritarian countries. In most authoritarian states such as Russia or Iran supposedly independent media engage in self-censorship: it is dangerous to even ask the government for permission to publish controversial material as that would attract too much attention to you. So instead even the media agencies fairly critical of the government have to mellow down their rhetoric often to the point where a story intended to criticize the government comes across as supporting it.\s\sHere at least we still have some semblance of media independence where one can generally criticize the government without getting in trouble.Who would‚Äôve thoughtNY Times ? You mean Pravda on Hudson ?Isn‚Äôt this standard practice if your story is about an institution or person? Don‚Äôt you need to inform them and give them opportunity to reply before publication so you can include it?I wanna see what the bastards editedNYT is straight up propagandaImagine justifying thisOkay easy. If you're writing a story about the government you send the story to the government so they can give you a comment or a quote on it.They don‚Äôt have to justify it.  The only thing that matters is their profit and if they feel that doing this will help their profits then good for them. Don‚Äôt read their newspaper.

I've long avoided talking much about his work with him because man the shit infuriates me. He mentioned once a couple coming across from Canada lived up in middle of nowhere and headed every winter down to the southwest US to vacation for a bit in an RV. He said he asked if they had any valuables to declare; they said they didn't. He inspected the RV and found a safe and asked again. They said still no. The ordered the safe open and there was 10 or 15 grand in cash. Which he then told me they seized. ""All they had to do was declare it"" he said as if he hadn't just stolen absurd amounts of money from people who hadn't done anything and effectively made a huge portion of their labour retroactive slavery. \s\sHad to have been a good ten years before he retired that he told me about it and it was pretty well the last time I ever cared to talk to him about his line of work.

As if the government was giving incentives for people to find competitive ways to handle such situation.

Chevron gone wildSo if someone strikes it rich with bitcoin then how do they actually cash out ever?You don't cash out just wait for Bitcoin to continue rising in value and destroying the government.

Eric Garner died in the hospital from cardiac arrest brought on by obesity diabetes heart disease asthma and smoking. Eric Garner was a career criminal with 30 priors out on bail for the same crime the cops observed him committing.Selling loose cigarettes isn't a crime.Go back to T_D.PigThe coroners report said he died from an asthma attack was induced the the choke hold he was placed in.   In all likelihood he would have died without a rescue inhaler once the choke hold was started.\s\sThere was definitely excessive police force used.  But the police had no way of knowing that he had an asthma condition.  Had they stopped choking him sooner there was a better chance he might have survived.\s\sBut this was a combination of excessive force combined with poor health.  The cops aren't 100% at fault here but they're not blameless either."

Too much jewlry? Antiques? Real estate? Cars? Have to sell some to pay the bill or you go to prison.\s\sThese every 3 month court appointments are asset-exams to see who the court finds ""can pay"" and who ""can't pay."" But in the real world many who are deemed ""can pay"" can't always put the theory to practice (i.e. what if they need 2 cars so both adults can commute to separate jobs what if they own a plot of land that no one wants to buy in addition to their house etc.).[deleted]True but I've never heard of a law that requires a debtor to appear in court every three months to confirm his continuing impoverishment.  The article says this is a law put in place by a judge at the suggestion of a plaintiff's lawyer.  That goes against several points in my civics class.Lawyers are going to have a field day with this.We are out of space in our prisons. Can we send some of our people to Kansas?

When they have to appear in court they are risking losing their job and at minimum they definitely lose a day's wages which is not exactly what you should be doing if you have debt to pay. There's much more to the story. And again this is for medical debt. Something which literally does not exist in every other developed country.Personal consumer debt should not be adjudicated in a fucking criminal court. They should never have to appear in a court house before a judge for a medical debt. Get the fuck out of here.The contempt of court charge is due to the debt...Debtors prison with extra steps.

Does anyone have instructions on how I can convert my entire net worth to this wonderful new monetary system?Part 2/2\s\s‚ÄúSuddenly China‚Äôs money moves bore watching. Central bankers from the U.S. and other Western economies fret that what Facebook planned with a digital currency could now be done by China a powerful government.\s\s‚ÄúThere is a sort of Uber fear‚Äù said a senior European central banker who has spoken to Western counterparts referring to stress on taxi systems when the ride-hailing company arrived in cities around the world. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want another country‚Äôs currency circulating among your citizens‚Äù the banker said.\s\sThe U.S. as the issuer of dollars that the world‚Äôs more than 21000 banks need to do business has long demanded insight into major cross-border currency movements. This gives Washington the ability to freeze individuals and institutions out of the global financial system by barring banks from doing transactions with them a practice criticized as ‚Äúdollar weaponization.‚Äù\s\sAmerican sanctions on North Korea and Iran for nuclear programs hobble their economies. Swiss banks abandoned their famous secrecy eight years ago to avoid Washington‚Äôs wrath in a showdown over taxes. After the February coup in Myanmar the U.S. used sanctions to block the movement of top military officials‚Äô financial assets through banks. The Treasury‚Äôs database of sanctioned individuals and firms‚Äîthe ‚ÄúSpecially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List‚Äù‚Äîtouches virtually every nation on earth.\s\sBeijing is especially discomfited by a fast-expanding part of the sanctions register: more than 250 Chinese names including politicians the U.S. accuses of atrocities against ethnic minorities or of curtailing freedoms in Hong Kong. Sanctions left Carrie Lam China‚Äôs top official in Hong Kong with a stockpile of cash in her home because banks feared that accepting her business would risk exposing them too to an American freeze.\s\sThe digital yuan could give those the U.S. seeks to penalize a way to exchange money without U.S. knowledge. Exchanges wouldn‚Äôt need to use SWIFT the messaging network that is used in money transfers between commercial banks and that can be monitored by the U.S. government.\s\sThe chance to weaken the power of American sanctions is central to Beijing‚Äôs marketing of the digital yuan and to its efforts to internationalize the yuan more generally. Speaking at a forum last month China‚Äôs Mr. Mu the central bank official repeatedly said the digital yuan is aimed at protecting China‚Äôs ‚Äúmonetary sovereignty‚Äù including by offsetting global use of the dollar.\s\sIn a 2019 war game at Harvard University veteran U.S. policy makers scrambled to craft a response to a nuclear-missile development by North Korea secretly funded with digital yuan. Because of the currency‚Äôs power to undercut sanctions the participants including several who are now in the Biden administration deemed it more threatening than the warhead.\s\sNicholas Burns a longtime American diplomat and favorite to be ambassador in Beijing told the group ‚ÄúThe Chinese have created a problem for us by taking away our sanctions leverage.‚Äù\s\sAs China‚Äôs marketing for the digital yuan kicks into high gear an English-language animation circulated online by state broadcaster CGTN shows a man in an American-flag shirt knocked out by a golden coin depicting digital yuan.\s\s‚ÄúThis is one of the building blocks of China‚Äôs move toward world market status and greater involvement in setting the framework of the global economy‚Äù the narrator says.\s\sInitially the digital yuan won‚Äôt change significantly how money circulates through China‚Äôs financial system. Under the central bank‚Äôs direction the six biggest commercial banks‚Äîall government-owned‚Äîwill distribute digital yuan to smaller banks and to app providers Alipay and WeChat which are expected to manage sender-recipient interactions.\s\sUnlike electronic transactions today the digital yuan is designed to move from A to B instantaneously at least in theory removing a way banks and financial apps profit off fees and brief built-in delays in such handoffs. The only necessary middleman is the central bank. Mr. Mu has said the digital yuan because it is state-backed will reduce risks to the financial system posed by China‚Äôs dominant payment platforms that are private companies.\s\sWhen a global TV audience turns its attention to skaters and bobsledders in Beijing‚Äôs Winter Olympics next February authorities are expected to give visiting athletes digital yuan to spend while they are in the spotlight an indication of ambitions that stretch beyond China‚Äôs shores.\s\sBeijing has joined an initiative to develop protocols for the cross-border use of digital currencies working with the Bank for International Settlements and the central banks of Hong Kong Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.\s\sChina‚Äôs digital strides draw attention to how the U.S. needs to modernize its own financial infrastructure according to Kevin Warsh a former Fed governor now at Stanford University‚Äôs Hoover Institution. ‚ÄúIf we wait 5 or 10 years we may well end up with some very bad policy choices‚Äù he said.\s\sMore than 60 countries are at some stage of studying or developing a digital currency according to research group CBDC Tracker. Digital currencies hold some of their biggest potential for the 1.7 billion people globally who the World Bank says lack a bank account. The Bahamas has already issued a digital currency to address financially underserved populations. Some central banks say such currencies would come in handy for families of migrant laborers who make tiny fund transfers that are cumbersome and expensive.\s\sThe senior European central banker noted that international person-to-person money transfers can take days and worried that speed and efficiency could eventually make the digital yuan a preferred currency for remittances as countries deepen financial ties with China.\s\sChina with a working model is offering a ready way for managing digital cash. President Xi last year called for China to seize opportunities to set international rules for digital currencies much as Beijing has sought to influence and dominate an array of advanced-technology standards such as for 5G telecommunications driverless cars and facial recognition.\s\sAsked during a recent Senate appearance whether the dollar could be digitized to help the U.S. defend its supremacy the Fed‚Äôs Mr. Powell said researching that question is a ‚Äúvery high-priority project.‚Äù\s\s‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to be the first‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to get it right.‚Äù\s\s‚ÄîGrace Zhu contributed to this article.\s\sWrite to James T. Areddy at james.areddy@wsj.com\s\sAppeared in the April 6 2021 print edition as 'China Is Creating Digital Currency First For a Major Economy.'‚Äù\s\s(2/2)Part 1/2\s\s‚ÄúA thousand years ago when money meant coins China invented paper currency. Now the Chinese government is minting cash digitally in a re-imagination of money that could shake a pillar of American power.\s\sIt might seem money is already virtual as credit cards and payment apps such as Apple Pay in the U.S. and WeChat in China eliminate the need for bills or coins. But those are just ways to move money electronically. China is turning legal tender itself into computer code.\s\sCryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have foreshadowed a potential digital future for money though they exist outside the traditional global financial system and aren‚Äôt legal tender like cash issued by governments.\s\sChina‚Äôs version of a digital currency is controlled by its central bank which will issue the new electronic money. It is expected to give China‚Äôs government vast new tools to monitor both its economy and its people. By design the digital yuan will negate one of bitcoin‚Äôs major draws: anonymity for the user.\s\sBeijing is also positioning the digital yuan for international use and designing it to be untethered to the global financial system where the U.S. dollar has been king since World War II. China is embracing digitization in many forms including money in a bid to gain more centralized control while getting a head start on technologies of the future that it regards as up for grabs.\s\s‚ÄúIn order to protect our currency sovereignty and legal currency status we have to plan ahead‚Äù said Mu Changchun who is shepherding the project at the People‚Äôs Bank of China.\s\sDigitized money could reorder the fundamentals of finance the way Amazon.com Inc. disrupted retailing and Uber Technologies Inc. rattled taxi systems.\s\sThat an authoritarian state and U.S. rival has taken the lead to introduce a national digital currency is propelling what was once a wonky topic for cryptocurrency theorists into a point of anxiety in Washington.\s\sAsked in recent weeks how digitized national currencies such as China‚Äôs might affect the dollar Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have said the issue is being studied in earnest including whether a digital dollar makes sense someday.\s\sThe dollar has faced challengers before‚Äîthe euro to name one‚Äîonly to grow more important when rivals‚Äô shortcomings became apparent. The dollar far outstrips all other currencies for use in international foreign-exchange trades at 88% in the latest rankings from the Bank for International Settlements. The yuan was used in just 4%.\s\sDigitization wouldn‚Äôt by itself make the yuan a rival for the dollar in bank-to-bank wire transfers analysts and economists say. But in its new incarnation the yuan also known as the renminbi could gain traction on the margins of the international financial system.\s\sIt would provide options for people in poor countries to transfer money internationally. Even limited international usage could soften the bite of U.S. sanctions which increasingly are used against Chinese companies or individuals.\s\sJosh Lipsky a former International Monetary Fund staffer now at the Atlantic Council think tank said ‚ÄúAnything that threatens the dollar is a national-security issue. This threatens the dollar over the long term.‚Äù\s\sThe digital yuan resides in cyberspace available on the owner‚Äôs mobile phone‚Äîor on a card for the less tech-savvy‚Äîand spending it doesn‚Äôt strictly require an online connection. It appears on a screen with a silhouette of Mao Zedong looking just like the paper money.\s\sIn tests in recent months more than 100000 people in China have downloaded a mobile-phone app from the central bank enabling them to spend small government handouts of digital cash with merchants including Chinese outlets of Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs.\s\s‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty good‚Äù said Tao Wei a young woman in Beijing after spending a test allotment. It took her just an instant to pay for her two-year-old daughter‚Äôs birthday portrait by pointing her iPhone toward a scanner. The Chinese Communist Party has also let members settle monthly dues with digital yuan.\s\sChina has indicated the digital yuan will circulate alongside bills and coins for some time. Bankers and other analysts say Beijing aims to digitize all of its money eventually. Beijing hasn‚Äôt addressed that.\s\sDigitized money looks like a potential macroeconomic dream tool for the issuing government usable to track people‚Äôs spending in real time speed relief to disaster victims or flag criminal activity. With it Beijing stands to gain vast new powers to tighten President Xi Jinping‚Äôs authoritarian rule.\s\sElements of this kind of control already exist in China as digital payments have become the norm. Mr. Mu has said the central bank will limit how it tracks individuals in what he calls ‚Äúcontrollable anonymity.‚Äù\s\sThe money itself is programmable. Beijing has tested expiration dates to encourage users to spend it quickly for times when the economy needs a jump start.\s\sIt‚Äôs also trackable adding another tool to China‚Äôs heavy state surveillance. The government deploys hundreds of millions of facial-recognition cameras to monitor its population sometimes using them to levy fines for activities such as jaywalking. A digital currency would make it possible to both mete out and collect fines as soon as an infraction was detected.\s\sA burst of cash-accumulation in China last year indicates residents‚Äô concern about the central bank‚Äôs eye on every transaction. Song Ke a finance professor at Renmin University in Beijing told a recent conference that China‚Äôs measure of yuan in circulation or cash popped up 10% in 2020.\s\sWhat about volatility? Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are famous for that. But the People‚Äôs Bank of China will strictly control the digital yuan to ensure there aren‚Äôt valuation differences between it and the paper bills and coins.\s\sThat means it won‚Äôt make sense for investors and traders to speculate in the digital yuan as some do with cryptocurrencies. Anti-counterfeiting measures will be designed to make it impossible for anyone besides the People‚Äôs Bank of China to create new digital yuan.\s\sWhile China hasn‚Äôt published final legislation for the program the central bank says it may initially impose limits on how much digital yuan individuals can keep on their person as a way to control how it circulates and provide users a dose of security and privacy.\s\sChina‚Äôs central bank won‚Äôt use the new technology as a way to get more money into circulation since every yuan issued digitally will essentially cancel one yuan circulating in physical form.\s\s\sThe People's Bank of China will control the value of the digital yuan.\sWhen bitcoin launched in 2009 most nations‚Äô policy makers largely played down its significance. China paid attention.\s\sAlways hypervigilant to threats the leadership feared that a cryptocurrency could undermine government power if people began using it in earnest. Zhou Xiaochuan China‚Äôs top central banker from 2002 to 2018 has said bitcoin both dazzled and frightened him. In 2014 he launched a formal study for a possible Chinese digital currency.\s\sChina hardly looked like a currency pioneer. Its strict government control of the yuan for instance ran counter to the rip-roaring trade in other major currencies.\s\sAt the same time a financial-technology revolution was under way in China with the frenetic adoption of the Alipay and WeChat apps making cash mostly unneeded and turbocharging startup companies with ways to pay on the go.\s\sThen in mid-2019 Facebook Inc. said it would pursue its own cryptocurrency. The realization this could circulate in a user base far bigger than any national population brought immediate recognition that technology could upend traditional currencies.\s\sWhile U.S. regulators focused on stopping Facebook ultimately succeeding China accelerated its pursuit of a digitized yuan launching trials in April 2020. ‚Ä¶.\s (1/2)Bitcoin is not anonymous at all. Seriously what the hell.I think I will pass.> will negate one of bitcoin‚Äôs major draws\s\sBitcoin's main advantages are control of it (if you have the private key) and lack of inflation (relative to fiat currency). Neither of those are negated by the competition from China's e-fiat.\s\s> one of bitcoin‚Äôs major draws: anonymity for the user.\s\sThat is a lie. Bitcoin is merely pseudonymous.This has already been in effect in Shanghai for a decade. An entire class of the economy is paid and spends this way (purely digital money) probably accounting for more people than most other nations.\s\sOf course r/neoliberal thinks China's capitalist but I remind those who have never looked into economics that this is a captive and state-bossed mode of exchange in a staunchly socialist country. This is only made possible by a treasury-central-bank-hybrid which is ""illegal"" in capitalist modes.\s\sThe only new news here is ambition for global yuan.#CreeperChinaChina is pushing hard in the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) field in order to benefit from the first-mover advantage.\s\sXi Jinping hopes that this initiative will eventually shake the US dollar from its hegemonic status.\s\sFor the Chinese people nothing extraordinary here. It will be one more tool to monitor everything they do.\s\sIt is the last missing piece in the Chinese social credit system that will allow for even better control (and eventually censorship) of the financial transactions of Chinese citizens.\s\sThere is already talk about the idea of putting some kind of maximum use date for the money issued via this e-RMB in order to force citizens to consume.Yep. ‚ÄúMaximum use date‚Äù essentially being a negative interest rate but they‚Äôll never call it that.In brave new world they change soccer equipment rules so people will consume more. I always found that eerie.  \sTruely Huxleyan combined with the authoritarianism of Orwell‚Äôs 1984.Until the yuan becomes a global unit of account this is more of a headfake by China to track its citizens all of whom desperately want to dollarize their assets but are blocked from doing so. Any person with wealth in China would have no interest in this digital asset.  Real digital currency based in a currency board will happen but it won‚Äôt be one based on a manipulated currency to begin with.I think the digital yuan is actually a very attractive method of payment if they can build up global payment infrastructure. Particularly Europe who is also developing their own digital currency will be keen on working with China on building an alternative to SWIFT[deleted]With auto depo and debit cards is almost there already. My wife hasnt touched cash money in yearsYeah! I heard that the Fed just discontinued its M1 reporting... this has never happened before. This is the end of the Dollar as we know it.

If a company took all its profit and paid bonuses to every employee that company would have 0 tax liability. There is nothing wrong with a company paying 0 tax. Every employee pays tax. Every purchase the company makes is taxed. Every piece of real estate is taxed (maybe). If they dont turn a profit or they reinvest their profit into growth ZERO TAX LIABILITY.And I‚Äôve never heard of a company worth billions lying before so‚Ä¶.

And if that‚Äôs by design...then that means it‚Äôs rigged. It is rigged in that the way it works is determined by legislation which is likely the result of some form of lobbying. Groups of interest seek to influence the final rule set to their benefit. In almost any other context (competitive sports for example) this would be called rigging.\s\sThis trend is also occurring in Canada and other developed nations but at a different rate partly because of the existence of social programs and more social democratic leanings in their values. Regardless the middle class is shrinking due to salaries not rising inflation spiking and the tax burden being directed mostly at them for the benefit of corporations and the super-rich who hold most of the wealth and yet seek to increase their share to the detriment of the rest of society under the argument that they provide employment and other essential contributions for the benefit of all.\s\sThe US represents indeed an extreme case of a ""rigged economy"" in great deal due to EVERYTHING being fair-game for business (resulting in access to essentials like quality healthcare services being determined by economic status for example) and an extremely self-centered and individualistic set of values (e.g. Ayn Rand's views which influenced people like Paul Ryan) that shape their decision making at both the personal and collective levels. This has encouraged ruthless plunder at the top of the structure and a complete disinterest in providing opportunity for those at the bottom while also making it easier to erode their social rights for the benefit of the bottom line with actions like privatizing health care. A Stiglitz special.That 2nd chart with 10 vs 90 percentile wage gap growth... that is the biggest abortion of a chart crime I have ever seen.  You‚Äôve noted both the Gini index and Gatsby index. Sure it‚Äôs not as easy to get into the top tier in the US as some other countries but the raw number of immigrants in the US trumps those arguments.\s\sThe immigration rates prove that people want to come to the US far more-so than other destinations. America *is* exceptional. [removed]What better person then to understand that it‚Äôs rigged. its not companies rigging it companies have as much power as people do - the federal reserve is what causes a lopsided economy and prevents actual capitalism that would help the middle income people\s\sTrump is the only one on federal level trying to help fundamentals by lowering taxes and regulationNot exactly an objective article.If by not objective you mean utter bullshit It's worse that you think.\s\sThe move to digital will eventually result in expirable currency.  Once money can be ""expired"" the state/banking system will move towards ""bottom up"" stimulus.  That's right the one thing Maynard Keynes couldn't fathom was the idea of money being entirely elastic while in the possession of the end user.  Taxes and the forced expenditure of money is how nation-states around the globe are going to extract themselves from the monetary dead ends they've been traveling towards.Why would you need an expirable currency when you can just generate inflation and basically accomplish the same thing?What a crap article!so my taxes are going down now right?Going up... They gotta make up that lost moneyThe last time the pentagon could not account for trillions of dollars 9/11 happened....and that shit fucked everything up.The plane that hit the pentagon hit the office of the auditors trying to figure it all out! There were no survivors!Couldn't it just be an accumulated accounting error... I mean that type of stuff happens all the time in the corporate world and when you're dealing with massive amounts of money a prospective accounting principle change can really shake the books up.\s> It means that the dollar is sprinting down a path toward worthless. If the Pentagon is hiding spending that dwarfs the amount of tax dollars coming in to the federal government then it‚Äôs clear the government is printing however much it wants and thinking there are no consequences.It's not.\s\sThe $21 Trillion is completely misleading to anyone who understands what it means the audit is not going to tell a different story. The whole article is written by someone who does not understand the terms they are using or attempting to completely mislead people.\s\sFY 2015 is a great example of why this article is bunk.\s\sThe army got $120 billion of taxpayer money in 2015. Using the method of ""Adjustments Not Adequately Documented or Supported"" there was 6.5 trillion ""missing"" just for FY 2015. Does that make sense to you? They only got $120 billion how are they missing 6.5 trillion? Because these are accounting adjustments.\s\sThis quote shows how disingenuous the article is.\s\s*Given that the entire Army budget in fiscal year 2015 was $120 billion unsupported adjustments were 54 times the level of spending authorized by Congress.\s\sThat‚Äôs right. The expenses with no explanation were 54 times the actual budget allotted by Congress. Well it‚Äôs good to see Congress is doing 1/54th of its job of overseeing military spending (that‚Äôs actually more than I thought Congress was doing). This would seem to mean that 98 percent of every dollar spent by the Army in 2015 was unconstitutional.*\s\sThe article makes it sound as if the army spent 54 times more than the $120 billion they were given. It is 100% factually not true. Accounting adjustments are not actual spending. If you move money from your Checking account to your Savings account did you spend that money? No that would be an example of an accounting adjustment.Like I say just be glad you don't get all the government you pay for.OK the source according to Media Bias Fact Check:  \s>LEFT BIAS  \s  \s>These media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward liberal causes through story selection and/or political affiliation.

NO MORE DEMOCRATS\s\sONLY BERNIE-CRATS[deleted]Sounds good split the party and let the GOP win.When are you going to stop pretending that America has a super secret super silent majority of ultra liberals? They don't exist. Americans don't want Berniecrats. They want Democrats and (unfortunately) Republicans.Bernie can‚Äôt get his folks elected sooooo.... what‚Äôs your plan B?I'm sure /r/politics will help get the word out and hold these Democrats responsible.\s\s^/sno we need more stories on Russia. I heard them say Peolsi should take the presidency. What in the world is going on in DC?  Are they all crazy.  Do we need to elect independents now?  Unbelievable. [deleted]We should have always elected independents. The two party system is two sides of the same con... I mean coin.\sThey are only interested in lining their pockets and remaining in power. Nothing has changed we just get more daily doses of their hypocrisy because we have the internet and can see what they're doing on the daily instead of waiting for some corrupt news agency to broadcast it.\s\sThis is the entire reason I campaigned so hard for Bernie. I still get upset that the Democrats decided to be stupid about it and now we have Trump... I'm actually still not clear on how James Clapper hasn't been charged with the blatant perjury he committed nearly four years ago.  If he was never held accountable then what can we really expect from these people?My fucking guy too Schiff. The guy who looked like he was going to be a hero with the Nunes thing last summer. Pshhh...[deleted]Schiff had establishment written all over him.  \s\sWhy do you think he got so much air time?There is no two-sided fight. It's all the same theater.dems and cons = two peas in a podDidn't Trump just extend what Obama had already put in place?  Where was this rhetoric over the past 8 years?  This is beyond a Trump issue it's politicians trying to gain as much access into our lives as possible.>Where was this rhetoric over the past 8 years?\s\sProgressives (like TyT or this subreddit) have been extremely angry at Obama & everyone over this. Since forever.\s\s>Didn't Trump just extend what Obama had already put in place?\s\s1. Yes for __6 years__\s2. The program has been expanded under this new law now Trump can spy on anyone anytime for any reason with zero need for a warrant.They are closer to Trump than they'd like to admit.I'm a Democrat in terms of I agree with what they say they will do. Unfortunately many of them are fucking scumbags too. Dems need to really get their shit together before next election and November. Running on a pure Hate Trump basis is not going to work. It's fucking lazy campaigning.

This bill was probably the reason why Trump accuses the intelligence branch of spying on him. There's little he can do with the powers of this bill because it's not for his personal use. Realistically is he going to ask the CIA to start spying on Mueller because that's his biggest threat right now.please stop sensationalizing this as unconstitutional. it's been upheld by every single court that has ever challenged it and would not if it was a violation of anyone's constitutional rights. It violates the fourth amendment.True but court justices can interpret the Constitution however they please. There's nothing stopping a justice from ruling within their agenda as long as they cite enough court precedent to back it up.  I don't follow isn't this warrantless spying for foreign individuals?  I get that US citizens may get caught in it but why would be the motive for the government to search a US citizen data? Can someone explain their discontent with those democrats that voted yesas someone who was born and spent most of his life in california it pains me to say this but what the hell california? Not him intelligence agencies. This sub is a joke.>The National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense __under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence.__\s\sTo be honest it's probably like\s\s> Hi I'm from the NSA I don't give a fuck about which team you play for. What interests me is all of this audio and video we have of you fucking everyone who isn't your spouse. And the invoices for all of the weird dildos. And the oxy prescriptions. Go and vote please.Kinda wonder if Dems would support this because it somehow helps with the Mueller investigation.  Maybe more to this than just the obvious? > Maybe more to this than just the obvious\s\sOf course there is but don't expect anyone here to understand.Would like to hear Schiff's side on this. The problem with the law in the first place was that no one would give up this power. Republicans would have a field day if the policy ended and there was an attack after. Most of these folks should be voted out but really this post is once again indistinguishable from any other Republican propaganda designed to draw a false equivalency. It would sure be nice if Bernie positioned himself regarding these glorified mercenaries who are an Oil company's private army.He fiercely opposed DAPL and the treatment of the protesters there.

He read scripts he didn't write them.I recall him saying at the DNC convention in 2008 a bunch of Obama platform catchphrases at the crescendo and then the line ""...more cops on the streets..."" and then something about more criminals locked up I think.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sStood out for me to remember it 12 years later.Make sure foreign money and influences don't shape it the way they want. Especially naturally toxic ones. I agree that we should limit foreign influence like Russia Saudi Arabia and Israel. \s\sBut he US oligarchs would still rig the economy. In fact I'd argue that the US intelligence agencies and oligarchs purposely manipulate the public to focus on external enemies so that they can have an excuse to silence dissenters who call out the domestic rigging of the economic system.\s\sWe're already seeing facebook and twitter silence groups who are critical of police US foreign policy and government surveillance.I am a pro SEO here and a life long left-winger... \s\sI think they are wrong about this one. This most likely has more to do with the crap site structure minimal structured data antiquated URL structure lack of canonical linking zero alt text on images and total disregard for modern web standards and practices. In addition the site validates with over 100 errors on the w3c validator. If they repaired those issues and they were still having these issues I might believe this. \s\sThere are some serious indexability issues with this site which is more likey what is depreciated in a Google search update than this. \s\sUpdate:\sI got a minute so I ran the site through a couple Google tools to back up my claims the site is not mobile friendly fails the [Google Mobile Friendliness Tool](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=JVCoCK0lj2jD2jjKTxcldg). Gets a poor rating (46/100) on [Google Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=wsws.org). Lastly the Google [Structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/#url=wsws.org) did not find any structured data on the site. \s\sUpdate #2: \sI am not saying this is not plausible. However considering how out of date their site is it would be very difficult to determine this as fact and in my profession I come across more ranking issues based on the ones I listed above than almost anything else. \s\sUpdate #3: \sWhile I know I said that 3rd party traffic data is often in accurate is does often show trends. Which is usually what we use it for in the field of SEO. Similar web provides traffic estimates for almost every site so lets look at the ones mentioned in the article [WSWS](https://www.similarweb.com/website/wsws.org#overview) [Alternet](https://www.similarweb.com/website/alternet.org)  [Counterpunch](https://www.similarweb.com/website/counterpunch.org#overview) [Wikileaks](https://www.similarweb.com/website/wikileaks.org) [Global Research](https://www.similarweb.com/website/globalresearch.ca) [Consortium News](https://www.similarweb.com/website/consortiumnews.com) and the [ACLU](https://www.similarweb.com/website/aclu.org). \s\sHere they are overlaid in a nice graph that I put together in Excel: http://imgur.com/a/Mx7Xt\sTo me the data is inconclusive. There is no way to tell if those other sites lost traffic because of search ranks dropping. Looking at these sites as a group they appear to be steadily loosing traffic since January and Frankly there just is not enough data to jump to conclusions here. \s\sUpdate #4: \sAnyone notice that chrome is asking to translate the site? This issue alone could be part of their problem as their site may not be declaring languages properly. Which is going to potentially confuse search engines. While this is not a 100% thing it does show how many search engine flaws we can find on this site in very short order. This sounds like a perfect application of Hanlon's Razor\s\s>\sNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity\s\s>\s\sSo it sounds like we need to get some progressive coders on this problem... I hear there may be a slack and or GitHub for that... Still though I have noticed a change in search results to larger sites for very specific idealogical concepts which previously would fetch Wikipedia and various forums and blog sites which now return 2 pages of big news sites.Did you even look at the article there blocking sites like the ACLU?  How is that a crap site?  Also not sure using google to check if google is legit is totally sane.Pro SEO here as well and while that would explain this specific site I'm more skeptical considering many other similar sites also saw a decrease in rank.  \sStill -- it means that Google is increasingly favouring big sites over the long tail and even part time volunteer or grassroots web sites.\s\sIt already favoured big sites and now it's punishing those that don't keep up even more.This[deleted][](/hmmm) I wonder how/if this is affecting right-wing regressive websites in the same way....\s\sIf it's not then we have a problem.It likely is.. and needs to be addressed either way. I recall YouTube demonitized political news channels on both sides recently.\s\sThe media is already so centralized with the internet we have had alternate sources for information on the subjects the MSM have been discussing.. now it seems Google is trying to steer people back to MSM If it's forcing liberal centrism via algorithm we have a problem no matter what.We still have a problem. Google is directly people to MSM which might as well be Pravada-like  deep state media sites.It probably is since google is typically a progressive leaning company. It wouldn't make mich sense for them to intentionally create an opposite sway.I remember them saying that Counterpunch was fake news and it is no such thing. It's simply very progressive/left wing. Nobody should be able to decide that for us. Counterpunch is fake news in terms of their economic narratives.""Fake news"" was always going to end up concentrating media power into fewer hands - intentionally or unintentionally. There will always be a tension between using vetted sources and living in a bubble. Use alternate search engines to keep from being trapped in a bubble. Duckduckgo for example. Use your own mind to vet your own sources.

In fact I remember a lot of left leaning news outlets like CNN questioning the legitimacy and authenticity of WikiLeaks then... Despite it's excellent track record.>left leaning news outlets like CNN\s\sKind of undermines your point.

That definitely seemed like media propaganda and manufacturing consent.\s\s.I don't see the issue here.  When a company releases a press release often the same words are used in the news article.

They do not have the [employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office#Personnel) to spy everywhere and might be reluctant and bound by organizational rules not to share.  It is unlikely that it is the NRO as it would be easier to use radar receiving antennas closer than 100 miles away.  Radar/microwave antennas are larger than a camera as the wavelength of radar/microwaves are much larger than visible light.  It is expensive to put this stuff up in LEO or GEO.  And it is cheap to put antennas on the ground.\s\s\s>Same reason they promote neurological and biological tech as strictly 'medical' in the media when in reality a lot of that shit is already weaponized against civilians discreetly.\s\sThere is no proof of this.  I have read articles written by those under attack of such things found either in MRI (bright spots on xray like images) or other claims.  This does not make sense to me.  That some doctors are involved is likely.  That many doctors are involved is not likely.\s\sThink about this: medical errors are responsible for a significant number of fatalities.

0,1984isreality,Foodforthought,58,"I always hated the Pledge of Allegiance patriotic songs & holidays (except cook outs we had) and all that jazz. I wasn't raised to be proud of my country - my family was too busy trying to survive. Besides I was always told by my grandparents - who grew up & worked under Jim Crow - that America was the 'White man's country'. That was the attitude of most Black people up through the 80s anyway. Only one person in the immediate family served in the military and he's a millennial. My stepdad went to Vietnam still suffers from PTSD.It does resonate. (Dual Can-US grew up in Canada fwiw) and dissent is quickly shut down ridiculed shouted overs suggested to be anything from disloyal to verging on treasonous etc. Remember Kapernick?  There seems to me to be a lot of truth on this article.I absolutely hated how Kapernick's protest was *completely* sidestepped because ""He dont staynd for da flayg."" These are the same exact people who claim to hate political correctness and that we should ""tell it like it is."" Well here it is. Fuck the flag fuck the anthem and fuck people who think merely living in a place means you should be ""proud"" of it.Very interesting. Although this article is only about the conditioning within America and I'm not a American so I can't tell if it is really like that. But as far as I know there also has been most of the times people in the USA they voiced a critical opinion about going into conflicts. The peace movement during the Vietnam War may be a good example for this.There is always a dissent but that dissent is often ignored by the people that make decisions.Vietnam war still had the draft the draft at the time.\s\sImportant for two reasons. The most obvious one being people will be much more critical about a war if they might unwillingly get drafted into it. The second being that the solders themselves protesting the war was what really brought it to a halt and of course filling your ranks with all sorts of people that don't want to fight well they're going to tell all the other soldiers why it's bad. Imagine if Walmart had the power to force people to work for them and started hiring all sorts of people that really don't want to work for Walmart hate Walmart or hate the way they treat their workers. They'd be swamped with strikes and unionizing really damned fast.This is true but as a non-American who had a lot of American internet friends at the time of 911 it was amazing to me how quickly some of them (who had seemed peaceful and somewhat critical of US foreign policy) turned around and embraced war and became really sensitive to anyone criticizing any of their country's actions. Maybe older people were different though idk.Quite honestly I was expecting an anti American sentiment before reading this article. I do think it gives a factual basis for the concerns. We have normalized militaristic actions. I grew up saying the pledge of allegiance every day. At the time I just assumed every other country did this too. \s\sI do think this article should give everyone pause.The text of the American pledge of allegiance is  relatively benign imo. I grew up singing the Canadian national anthem everyday the lyrics of which I would paraphrase as ‚ÄúBring it on! We‚Äôre ready for you!‚Äù.I've known this since I was in the Boy Scouts which is functionally army-prep for kids.Not necessarily way way back in the day. It was more of a community event that brought people together. Survival skills are useful for everyone.  But nowadays it feels more like army for kids.It's gotten a lot worse since 9/11. Now it's open fetishization whereas before it was implicit.My whole family's made up of immigrants and we're all pretty patriotic. Like we celebrate huge Thanksgiving dinners fourth of July is a big thing for us and all. We were all under a lot of political issues in China and our family lost everything due to issues we ran into. We come to America within 5 years my uncles are all rich same with my mother. I was pretty grown when we came here and I prefer America so idk how to feel honestly. I'd take a bullet for America but I'm wrong idkIn other news the sun rose in the east today.""At least it's settled in a final location""I agree with the article. But it's more about a political stance than psychology.This all may be accurate and I being a mix breed half NA and the other half a nice smorgasbord of White I feel proud of the people in America for the most part not really the government portion. Again I'm sure many will strongly disagree but I didn't care if Kapernick stood or kneeled he had/has a right to show his disdain over things he sees as wrong just like those who burn the flag at demonstrations. I however think in some instances he went WAY WAY WAY to far the American flag on the back of a design of a tennie shoe (imo ridiculous he called them out for that). If you look far enough into the history of any country you will always find things you can now loudly disagree with. Just know it isn't a ""white mans world"" it is a ""RICH MANS WORLD."" I suffered some days lucky we had bologna to eat or bread to put it on. My family has been in armed forces many different generations but I still suffered and I'm not a millennial I'm probably nearer to the ""ok boomer"" age midrange for x-generation closer to y but regardless.

I meant *downvote*[deleted]As much as we joke about this we need to change this.there is no u.s. justice system. there is only property interests laundered as justice. the cato institute (for what it's worth) claims that *all rights claims* derive from [property claims](https://www.cato.org/cato-handbook-policymakers/cato-handbook-policy-makers-8th-edition-2017/property-rights-constitution). this ideology is part of the dna of the united states; just like the civil war wasn't about states rights the revolutionary war wasn't about liberties/freedoms - they were both about property (chattel and taxation).How are there not more homicides involving judges. People have killed for less. Robbing someone of there freedom for several years seems like a good motive.Probably because you would have to be ready to die to try to kill a judge. Its like law enforcement. If you attack a police officer hell will rain down on you until you are captured/killed.It's a strong motive anyway.

Why do you think it's so expensive to live in Seattle nowadays? The matter of the fact is that skilled laborers are better off today than they ever have been and unskilled laborers are suffering due to stagnant wages for unskilled labor and rising living costs. You can't expect Amazon to voluntarily pay above the market rate for unskilled labor especially when you consider how slight the margins are in the online retail space.  The answer is to raise the minimum wage. Exactly. The minimum wage should be tied to cost of living for each area.He's not a good guy then again so aren't the investors either or the board but maybe they can't do shit because bezos shuts down anything that gives more of the profit to the people that actually do the work of shipping and receiving payment for the products sold and all the support that makes the company billions.  \s\sWhat congress can do what Americans are good at they do it all over the world is support and finance a strong union movement and organization that will force Amazon to address these issues because it effects millions of people who purchase products and invest in Amazon.   If the people don't do anything bezos has enough capital and loan collateral that he can literally end up being the only retailer in America he can take out or buy Walmart homedepot and bestbuy then it's welcome to bezosville if he hasn't already thru multiple offshore shell companies and trusts where everybody is on food stamps and a toaster costs $300.  He can then buy McDonald's and sell it on amazon buy papa johns and you can order food on Amazon with a guy on foodstamps racing to a McDonald's on his ebike order you a Big Mac combo race to your door as you pay for your $20 combo made by another of bezos employees on food stamps.  \s\sWhy stop there he can buy banks then you can pay $25 per debit fee transaction surcharges on your bezos capital one credit card with 45% interest made in a factory by a guy on food stamps who works for bezos  then he can buy police departments and use his money to take over the budget of states effectively making everybody in America his employees as every moron he's fucked over awes in wonder and amazement on the internet that an American is the first multiquadrillionaire in history and he makes a trillion dollars a day as you look for food stamps for lunch while ordering a bezos uber driven by a guy on foodstamps on your $2500 iPhone 12 which bezo can easily buy Apple now sold to you by one of his employees who you guessed it is on food stamps as the federal government now uses your tax dollars to pay and supplement bezos employees as he buys up the United States of America and he purposely impoverishes everybody making them utterly dependent on him and Amazon for everybodies very survival and manipulates and holds hostage the financial fortunes of the entire American economy to feed his megalomaniacal ego and absolute lust for power and control as everybody hails emperor bezos and fans 'admiration' for all he has accomplished because if you don't he'll can your ass and you'll lose your foodstamps he'll cancel your credit card and kick you out of his credit card report company run by you guessed it a guy in food stamps. And youre on the street not being able to eat or work because bezos has bought everything.So you guys better do something because he's quickly getting to the point of no return.  \s\sThis looks like revenge of the ""nerds"" the final chapter.

And you know ""nerds"" i.e. calling someone that because they like science or games or Star Trek or anything that isn't the ""nfl"" and treating them like shit ends up making some people very bitter and angry and now that everybody is kissing bezos because of his money he's treating them with contempt.   It's probably no surprise that all those factory workers on food stamps were probably the high school athletes that for one reason or another probably their arrogance and assholeness didn't make it to the pros and are now working in a ""nerds"" warehouse.  I don't understand why liking awesome things like Star Trek video games sci fi technology space aliens etc makes you a ""nerd"" because that ""nerd"" world feeling is awesome incredible it's full of endless possibilities science fantasy God imagination creativity logic reason physics astronomy by some definition Indiana jones is a ""nerd"" but he's one of the badass characters ever created and Indy is far from a ""nerd"" so that how everyone should be you can like those things and like sports and cheerleaders and beer etc why separate the human experience into different groups and clics this seems like an American phenomenon.

Which isn't fair people aren't like that.>Dude you deserve some gold.I can feel that trickle.

Amazon workers are not on food stamps. \s\sThe only amazon employees that are on food stamps are either employees that only work part-time or employees that only worked at amazon for a very short period of time (but within the last tax year) and are being disingenuously included in this claim. \s\sAmazon offers all their employees including the lowest-paid ones substantial bonuses stock options and other financial incentives on top of the $15/hr minimum that the lowest-paid employees make (it quickly goes up if you‚Äôve been there for more than a year). \s\sAmazon also offers the same benefits to their lowest-paid employees as they do to their highest ones. Everyone gets up to 20 weeks of paid leave due to sickness pregnancy or vacation. If you have ever worked in a menial labor job you know that this amount of paid leave is unprecedented in any other warehouse. \s\sAmazon also pays for up to $12000 in education expenses for all their employees regardless of what level the employee is at and regardless of whether the education is related to the work the employee is doing at Amazon. \s\sIf you include the benefits into the calculation of average pay for an Amazon warehouse associate (whose base pay before stock options and benefits is about $29000) not only is it immediately clear that non of Amazon‚Äôs full-time employees would even qualify for foodstamps but it is also immediately clear that the total compensation package is more than 50% higher than the total compensation package an average warehouse associate in the United States receives. \s\sIt seems that people these days are all too happy to bash Amazon over factual inaccuracies and in some cases straight-up falsehoods. What I find especially ironic is that many of those same people have no problem enjoying their free two-day shipping after they‚Äôve finished virtue-signaling online. How much of Amazon's labor force is contracted through third parties?  I.e. you work in an amazon warehouse but are paid by xyz logistics corp?\s\sI know that some their delivery services are subbed out.  Any way to know how much of the factory labor is?\s\sHonest question because those contracted employees are likely getting the shaft in benefits and pay.The fact that you keep saying stock options already puts the validity of your post into question as Amazon has not offered options for many years. Reading below it turns out basically the entire post is wrong. Wasn‚Äôt amazon caught having bots write comments exactly like this on every thread that was negative about amazon \s\sLolSource? You can't just make all these claims and talk about factual inaccuracies without providing any sourcesNo no no!  That isn‚Äôt how any of this should work. We can‚Äôt cut down a business just because you disagree with it. \s\sThe freedom of market has let this company become the giant it is. We can‚Äôt punish companies for doing well. That would mean we can shut down companies for not performing. This kind of thing is the beginning of a communistic environment. \s\sWhy not target actual business models that truly have ‚Äútoo much power‚Äù. The centralized banks the Koch business G.E. Oil companies that influence policies. That isn‚Äôt America. \s\sFree enterprise is the backbone of America and will always be. If those workers don‚Äôt like their working conditions they can leave. Not like the sweat shops of other countries that deploy cut downs on businesses they disagree with. Setting aside the idea of low wages and food stamps this is a model for free enterprise. Yes they drive out specialized businesses but effectively they built a foundation on consumer demand and reacted appropriately to market conditions. They also mostly did it within regulations. So aside from the parallel of free enterprise and lack of government regulation this is exactly the outcome of a free market you would expect. \s\s\sA truely free enterprise is free to set prices at their whim which never works because you will always get undercut by competitors who adjust to market conditions and grow accordingly. Can I just ask if you think quitting and getting another job is so easy why are people doing this low paying jobs?I don‚Äôt fully understand myself but apparently there are common bits of social logic that say if you get rich you need to share with everyone ‚Äúnear‚Äù you and that employers are responsible for the well-being of employees. Culture at large seems not to understand second-order effects or incentives very much but there is a simple ‚Äúfree markets good‚Äù idea that still has currency.A truly free enterprise demands a labour force truly free to unionise. You can't have one without the other Ying and yang and all that. Found the boot licker If congress cared they could do something about it pretty easily with minimum wage change. ITT people who don‚Äôt know what market cap means.

Fuck all. I upvoted the article.  That'll fix mean-old Jeff right?Eventually it will reach a breaking point where popular sentiment can't be swayed by lobbyists. \s\sOr more realistically wages will get so depressed that the market collapses.Before worrying about how rich the company is let's worry about how poor the employees are wherever that might lead.Karl Marx made a simple statement of fact over 100 years ago:\s\s> ""Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer unless under compulsion from society.""\s\sAnd it's still 100% true today (with few trivial exceptions). I guess stating truisms like that is why capitalists hate him so much. But with that in mind:\s\sWhy can't we simply tax the richest man in the world and all of the other Amazon shareholders to make up for the corporate welfare they're bilking from us by paying poverty wages?\s\sOr why can't we set the minimum wage high enough so that no working person has to live in poverty -- wouldn't that be doing something to reverse our fast-eroding work ethic?\s\sIs it because we're ruled by 2 unapologetically capitalist political parties both bankrolled by the rich?a new age of splitting up big corporations is coming\s\ssilicon valley is gana get the hammer alsoAnd nothing will be done about it.I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it until everyone realizes it:\s\sConservatives will never give a shit about progressive policy goals until the problem personally affects them. They are incapable of empathy. \s\sThey didn‚Äôt care about corporations being too powerful until they started getting booted from social media. They didn‚Äôt care about drug law sentencing reform until their kids started having problems with opioids. They thought being gay was just a deviant lifestyle choice until their friends and family started revealing that they‚Äôve been attracted to the same sex their whole life and were ashamed to say anything about it. A few thoughts:\s\sBezos and the board will probably spin-off the AWS bz from the Amazon holding then they will have 2 companies worth more than $500BN and nobody will say sh*t never again about him.\s\sHe is taking all this heat recently in part due to the Market Capitalization of his company hitting a 1trillion mark.\s\sI could bet his business practices haven‚Äôt been changing to worse lately. It was probably very close to what it is today. \s\sI‚Äôm not saying that he is a benevolent entrepreneur nobody makes this much money by giving away riches to every needy soul. \s\sMaybe Steve Jobs would take the same heat if he was alive. \s\sThe title of this news is pure crap. \sI read a article about how some consider Amazon a monopoly (not sure if I can link the article). But I think we should be treating Amazon like a monopoly. Though I'm not sure if anyone is will to break up Amazon (or any other large company).  [deleted]Dude what you‚Äôre saying is against the narrative they‚Äôre portraying! Stfu will ya? \s\sThe fact that this is being downvoted just goes to show the echochamberedness of reddit. There is absolutely no grey area my friend!Is this sub for uninformed uneducated socialist titty babies?The classic [Man With Fence](https://youtu.be/Ai2bVK_BGHs) video is a great example of agitated/excited delirium.\s\sThis is a patient that can:\s* have severe acidosis or rhabdo\s* develop a deadly arrhythmia any moment\s* be impervious to pain masking a severe injury\s* have unstable or fluctuating vital signs\s* be unable to communicate\s* have incredible strength \s\sCaring for these patients is extremely difficult especially for EMS.  They get to the scene and the patient is handcuffed with six police officers on top of them and is still bucking them off.\s\sThe goal is to get the patient calm enough that their vital signs can be monitored the officer laying across their chest can get off their handcuffs can come off and they can be examined without anybody getting injured.\s\sThe article gets a few things wrong.  Ketamine is regarded as [a standard therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29033344/?i=2&from=/29229535/related) in these cases and is widely used because it is fast acting safer than many other sedatives in patients with cardiac instability or deranged vital signs and works predictably.  Its use is not novel nor is it ‚Äústrange and disturbing.‚Äù\s\sTo be sure [there is a risk of requiring intubation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29033344/?i=2&from=/29229535/related) after ketamine but these are patients with a potentially deadly condition‚Äîthere is no perfect sedative or antidote and ICU level care may be necessary no matter what.\s\sThere is also a risk of vivid nightmares (emergence) when coming out of a ketamine sedation but it‚Äôs worth pointing out that choosing an alternative sedative might result in death.\s\sAlso police can‚Äôt order EMS to administer drugs‚Äîas the article says they can request it.  EMS can absolutely refuse or can contact a physician for med guidance.Thanks for this background context and info. \s\sMost readers of course have concerned reactions to hearing about this usage of ketamine and/or potentially others.  Can you say if this is a request made by law enforcement with any other drugs or how long this kind of thing has been (apparently) part of a standard operating procedure of sorts?Another anecdote for the usefulness of Ketamine:\s\sMy grandmother is 93 with severe dementia. She escaped from the nursing home was panicked and fighting off anyone who came near her. She is frail with osteoporosis to the extent that the professionals weren't sure how they could restrain her without her breaking her bones. In her panicked state it was likely she would break her own bones by flailing if things continued.\s\sKetamine was the safest way to de-escalate the situation and get her stable.Why doesn't anyone in the medical industry seem to realise that ketamine is extremely psychedelic? \s\s""Vivid nightmares (emergence)"" - no it's as intense as LSD at high doses. At least that's why I've used it recreationally. You may be physically sedated but you're tripping fucking balls at the bottom of that k-hole.\s\sI don't think anyone should be using it on patients unless you have a psychologist on the other end to debrief or youre co-administering a strong amnesic like Midazolam.Nicely stated.I'm a paramedic and this article is bullshit.  I'm sorry but it's the kind of half-understood screed I'd associate with anti-vaxx nutters. \s\sCalling it a date rape drug is like calling   paralytic drugs ""lethal injection drugs"" - wilfully ignoring that three drugs are absolutely vital to any surgical procedure involving anesthesia. \s\sAnd ""excited delirium"" is absolutely a real thing.   I've seen it.   No shit it's not in the DSM it's a medical condition not a psychological problem.   Heart attacks and broken bones also aren't in the DSM but i assure you they're real too.\s\sKetamine is an amazing drug that i have administered a lot since our service got it a few years ago.  Like any drug it can be dangerous if used incorrectly but it's way safer for both patients and first responders than the way we used to do things. \s\sHere's what people fundamentally don't understand about working the streets.   A lot of the people who have police/EMS called on them are not like you at least at the time of the incident.     They are disoriented and incapable of even understanding what is happening around them and a danger to both themselves and those around them. \s\sI'm thinking of a guy we ran a few weeks back.   He's maybe 6'5"" 60 years old but still 275 pounds of mostly muscle.    He's in a trailer and his roommate called because he had a seizure.  We show up and he's completely out of it breathing heavily curled up in a ball at the foot of his bed.  \s\sA pretty standard rule of thumb in EMS is that you can be drunk/high/crazy as you want so long as you're oriented to your environment.   Basically are you in touch with consensual reality or not?   Because if you're not we have a duty to make sure you don't come to harm same way you can't just leave a small child alone. \s\sSo this guy is totally out of it delusional unable to meaningfully interact with the environment or speak coherently.   He's gonna go to the hospital.   \s\sIn the bad old days 8 cops firefighters and medics would have fought this guy for 45 minutes to wrap him in a few blankets like a burrito and try to carry a 275 pound kicking and squirming object out of a trailer with tight hallways narrow corners and rickety stairs with a four foot drop and no railing.   The chances of us or him getting hurt were pretty good. \s\sInstead we held him still for about 5 minutes and gave him a dose of Ketamine and he chilled out and we called him out without a problem.   Better results in half the time. \s\sWe do the same thing for subjects in police custody.   If they are disoriented and a danger to themselves they could break a wrist trying to get out of handcuffs or give themselves a concussion slamming their heads over and over into the window of the cop car (seen both those).  At that point the person is going to jail.   Not gonna change that.  So the question is how to get them there safely?  Most people who are oriented can eventually accept that yes they are going to jail and so there's no use fighting about it.   But someone who is delusional by definition can't understand that so they persist and risk injury.   At that point  Ketamine is a way to minimize harm.   And it's kind of a pain in the ass because then we have to take then to the ER and get them medically cleared before they can go to jail.  But it's absolutely appropriate to give. \s\sNow don't get me wrong if you were giving it out like candy that would be wrong.  And cops can request us for Ketamine but they can't order it to be given.  That's between me and my medical director.   The article implies somehow cops are ordering Ketamine given but i have a hard time seeing how that would work.   Miss likely they request us because they know we will decide to give it once we're there.  In the same way if i show up at a scene and a guy is acting dangerously i can request PD to respond.   I can't order them to arrest the guy but after a few years on the streets i know how it's gonna go down. \s\sReading the article cited here (ok well maybe more like skimming) I noticed there didn't seem to be reference to any specific incidences and thought this sounded more like fear-mongering and sensationalism than reporting.\s\sCame here read your comment and /u/dick_dangle's comment both of which supported that view.\s\sWent back though saw that the Techdirt article was actually a repackaging of [a story originally run](http://www.startribune.com/at-urging-of-police-hennepin-emts-subdued-dozens-with-powerful-sedative/485607381/) in Minneapolis's Star Tribune.\s\sIn the Star Tribune article found this\s\s> ‚ÄúIn many cases the individual being detained or arrested was not only handcuffed but strapped down on a stretcher in an ambulance before receiving ketamine‚Äù\s\sTo a person not in medicine that does indeed sound excessive.\s\sBut I'm guessing there may be times when a person's agitation and disorientation is so extreme that being handcuffed and strapped down is *not* much of a guarantee they aren't a danger to themselves or to others.\s\sIs that about right?> I'm a paramedic\s\sWe don't need your kind around here stranger. We got *strong opinions*; we don't need no actual experience and training.> And ""excited delirium"" is absolutely a real thing. I've seen it. No shit it's not in the DSM it's a medical condition not a psychological problem. Heart attacks and broken bones also aren't in the DSM but i assure you they're real too.\s\sEnglish is not my first language. I tried to find out how this condition was called in any other of the languages I speak and it seems to be something that curiously only exists in the anglosphere and it's greatly related to Taser manufacturers...\s\sIn what diagnose manual can I find it? ICD-10? OMIM? MeSH? DiseasesDB? MedLinePlus? eMedicine?\s\sThanks in advance.Thanks for the professional context. That's really enlightening.\s\sHave you ever taken Ketamine?\s\sGetting people high without their permission and possibly causing trauma doesn't seem cool tbh Call me paranoid (*come on do it!*) but this falls nicely for me in the ongoing effort of police to expand their sphere of operations. They don't want to be just police; they want (well many of them seem to want) to be in a more central role in making a wider range of decisions about people and societies than just ""should this person be arrested according to the rules of evidence?""\s\sIn this case we have police reaching into paramedics' and MDs' domains of decision making. In South Carolina recently the police union decided it needed to stick its fingers into public school curricula by [condemning certain books](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/03/south-carolina-police-object-to-high-school-reading-list) children are allowed to read. \s\sRecent (and less recent) [cases](http://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2018/07/04/maga-mayhem-fractures-a-mans-skull-as-right-wing-marchers-test-the-limits-of-free-speech-in-portland/) of police deciding which ""side"" needs protection when right- and left-wing protesters confront each other; when they should intervene versus do nothing who needs to be pepper sprayed etc. can be seen as the police not only enforcing the law but expanding their grasp to deciding when where and how it should be enforced. This kind of selective enforcement isn't really policing *per se*; it's public policy.\s\sWhen police arrest or harass POC or poor people often at the request of white or status-quo citizens (e.g. the recent Starbucks case the AirBnB case the two kids-selling-water cases etc.) they are going beyond their mandate by differentially applying their discretionary authority (or sometimes just power) in a way that looks a whole lot like they'd like to be the police of a broad range of public behavior not just the kind that legally requires law enforcement.\s\sAnd of course we have the nonstop parade of police brutality cases in which some cops apparently would like to be Judge Dredd and do the judging and punishing on the spot instead of just the arresting.\s\sThese incidents often involve only a few individual officers in a department or a few departments out of the thousands in the US. However we almost never hear any criticism of those actions from the rest of the police. Departments rarely (except when the shit is hitting all the fans) say anything remotely critical of even the most egregious overstepping of authority. When a given PD has a string of abuses other PDs keep their mouths shut too. When officers are prosecuted or when investigations reveal corruption or when legislators (or others) succeed in applying any consequences to illegal or immoral officer behavior police unions scream like Neymar on a yellow card and nobody from within the police force ever disagrees no matter how egregious the claims.\s\sLong rant. Sorry. It's what I do I guess. But when some people see a few officers doing something pretty crazy in MSP I see yet another data point in the decades-long (and recently increasing) trend of police wanting a lot more power than they have.\s\s*Edit*: a few typos[removed]That's some quality ranting.\s\sFor what it's worth though I think I'm with you on that ""expansion"" of the police's powers now into the concerning new sphere of apparently being able to administer drugs.  ...There's definitely a pattern and if this story gets fleshed-out it'll be (another?) one of a very disturbing trend for sure.I see where you're coming from and i feel you but u think this specific case is exactly the opposite.  Before ketamine cane along the answer was a bunch of cops firefighters and paramedics would dog pile on a person to subdue them.   It took forever and both the patients and first responders often got hurt.   \s\sNow we have a much less traumatic way of subduing someone who is a danger to themselves and others. \s\sWe're using it (I'm a paramedic) because PD really doesn't want to be on the evening news beating the shit out of some guy.   That's how the Rodney King riots started. \s\sOnly exception is that it's only used on medical patients.   If a guy is just drunk and belligerant he's still getting tazed or tackled.  But if we think he's got a medical problem we'll sedate him and take him to the hospital.   That's a good  thing and an improvement to how things used to be. \s\sIf you want to critique American policing there's plenty to go around.   But if you want to have meaningful progress that means recognizing when things go good.see r/bad_cop_no_donut**C'mon you're being paranoid.**\s\sThought provoking post. And cannot dismiss it as paranoid rants.

This was only possible because the state was ready to violently enforce his ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt create a computer revolution he destroyed one.On the flip side there's a lot of free software developers that don't get compensated fairly for the work they do. I used to be one.linux.orgThe left didn‚Äôt have as much of a presence back then as it does now. Hell it didn‚Äôt have much of a presence at all pre-Sanders. There wasn‚Äôt really a substantial voice back then to counteract both the IDpol crowd and the reactionaries who are now grifting their way into political discussions.I was figuring it out and looking at politics at the same time.\s\sWe could use more people in talking about a left perspective to get the neoliberals from dominating the discussion actually.It literally the opposite reason. Only the left is hard pushing their ideology on the gaming world when gamers just want to play games.\s\sSo when people randomly start suggesting gamers are sexist dominated by incels and need to change drastically according to some leftist ideal especially with bad justification people naturally want them to fuck off.The left didn‚Äôt have a presence pre-Sanders? The *entire* left half of the political spectrum? Has only Bernie Sanders to thank for even existing?Not to mention mass firing of talented and creative minds """"""threatening"""""" to unionize for better standards. What a goddamn shame.I'll just say not to defend Bethesda's *reliance* on modders but mods getting implemented into the game officially is really cool and I wish it was done more.\s\sThe only other times I can think of it ever happening was when they added modded gamemodes and maps to Halo 4 multiplayer and horses in Minecraft. Both were great.Modding is good. What isn‚Äôt good is a game being half assed and the defense people have of it is ‚Äúoh well modded will fix it‚Äù. Modders are good but they shouldn‚Äôt be treated as devs patching the game because the actual devs got a shitty time table and couldn‚Äôt finish the game had the studio intervening too much or just didn‚Äôt care enough. Also Bethesda old shitty engine has got to go they just use modability as an excuse to keep the thing when it‚Äôs an archaic engine.As a person who has dabbled in game mods and game hacks they are cool especially when a mod is officially included as an update to the game or an expansion. However I think the line is crossed is when modders patch in official modes that were hinted at or was included in previous entries of a game series but axed or would be added in a future update to the game.This doesn't happen with other games because they're not incomplete and broken like Bethesda games. See The Witcher 1 for example it has a page on nexus but it doesn't have a lot of mods because the game was launched with everything he must have. Now looks to Fallout 3 mods in more downloaded of all time: most mods are things that are already supposed to be in-game.oldest trick scare people with a ""culture war"" while the real economic war rages against themCommunism literally delivered to us gamers one of the greatest games of all time:\s\sTetris.*Papers Please* is pretty fun.It was Marxist-Leninism not communism and you're making the common error of assuming everything created under a system is a product of that system.I think you mean communism almost deprived us of Tetris. They had to smuggle the game out of the USSR to get it published. Still sucks that gamers find fascism so appealingVideo games radicalized meI became an atheist due to Santa Claus and Chess.Oliver Thorn of PhilosophyTube did an excellent [video](https://youtu.be/IYkLVU5UGM8) on this very topic. I highly recommend it!As a gamer i approve of this message üëåüòéüëçI recommend all of Olly's videos.I love Olly but I was a little underwhelmed by this video - not because there's anything wrong with it it's just that it doesn't really improve on anything that [Jim's original video](https://youtu.be/HmW0GhdDOvw?t=30) did. Especially if you want to try to 'convert' some nonpolitical or right-wing gamers Jim is a better go-to because he's more relatable to them on account of being primarily a gaming channel and because of how explicit he is about his distaste for AAA gaming companies which gamers so love to hate.My 21 yo gamer son is a Berner. But he will love thisSo close but he's missing a big factor in all this. Just like has been done to Bernie supporters in politics and to people who criticize certain movies (Ghostbusters 2016 The Last Jedi Terminator Dark Fate etc) the media has [waged an idpol smear campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STl7-_f4_eA) against ""gamers"" painting them as toxic racist misogynists in order to shut down and suppress criticism of corrupt practices and paid shill critics in the gaming industry. \s\sThis is what inspired the r/GamersRiseUp subreddit which many seem to fail to recognize is a parody satirizing this ridiculous misrepresentation of the gaming community as an white supremacist incel organization by the media.\s\sYes obviously you can find racists and sexists among the gaming community. But you can say the same thing about any group consisting of literally hundreds of millions of people especially one where the majority are teenage boysI fully agree. Media has a hand in creating this ideal that many grown-up gamers follow. However I also believe that gaming media is also one of the main reasons why these capitalistic trends keep developing in video games.\s\sMajor game publishers like Activision Besthesda or EA know that gaming journalism will suck up to the poor quality of the games for the money the publishers pay them to review the game. Gaming journalism gives the game high reviews. People look at the reviews and believe ""Hell yeah this will be a good game!"" Then people play the game and realize that it does not live up to their expectations. People get angry and rage at both the reviewers for lying to them and the game publisher for making a boring or terrible game. Then anger quells and the game publisher gets their money game reviewers are satisfied and players will wait for the next game to come out in the hopes of it being better than the last one.\s\sKeep in mind these trends can also appear in video games after they are published like Activision updating the new Crash Team Racing game with microtransactions a month _after_ it released.\s\sThe video game industry has been extremely sneaky as of late for financial incentives.I'm taking a different approach.  I'm focusing on class in gaming hence /r/classgaming and how games have different politics.\s\sI haven't focused on this much since the elections are going on but I'm actually going to be doing posts and podcasts about the topic starting this year to show the topic of gaming from a left perspective.You may say r/GamersRiseUp is parody and it may have been at one time but it's as sincere as possible now.Gonna disagree with you there dude. Alt-right dickheads clearly use gaming groups as prime hunting grounds. Innuendo Studios on YouTube actually has an awesome video on it.\s\sBiggest take away for me was:\s*The alt-right befriends young isolated and depressed white guys and uses their emotional and psychological vulnerability to lie to them and convert them to their alt-right groups. (I.e nazi punks)*as someone who plays video games most gamers ARE toxic racist homophobic as all get out and hyper misogynistic. In eleven years of MMOs i have never gone more than a few minutes without a spray about blacks jews gays transes etc etc. Constant stream of it.Gamersriseup has been completely co-opted by racists and the alt right at this point.\s\sIts full of unironic racism and has generally just become the exact sort of place it used to criticize.Rise up was satire. It is no longer satire. If you think it still is or is similar to what it was originally then you are part of the problem and the person this post is talking about.GamersRiseUp is a sub of unironic white supremacist incelsr/GamersRiseUp seems to have been invaded by actual white supremacists and incels though lol which is pretty sad as it was a cool meme sub for meThat‚Äôs the vocal minority man. Idk if it‚Äôs because I live in California region but usually in multiplayer games racist pricks get booted off fast.So true. It's ironic that alt-righters see monotony and confuse it with diversity. The gaming industry has been monopolized and in infantilized. Game developers are treated like garbage  any attempt to organize and demand better working conditions/wages is taken down by union busters and reactionaries scared of what they think is socialism. Capitalism in decay always produces this type of outcome. Monopolization instigates stagnation price gouging bad wages job loss and degeneracy of creativity.  The only answer to this is two things. Reformism or revolution. Either business giants like EA and Activision are forcefully broken up made to improve worker conditions and set pro worker standards or these companies are forced into collectivization/worker cooperations so that the profit motive that hinders creativity is removed so only the drive to create new and fun video games remain. Coupled with good working conditions the quality and quantity of games will go up.Most gamers are just normal ass dudes and dudettes tho...Gamers^TM not gamers.we are talking about Gamers. not people who play games.Our unwillingness to see our imbalanced anger and aggression is something we need to address.Gamers are all right wingers? Since when?The ones that rose up are.The loudest and meanest ones are.r/GamersRiseUp Gamers are right-leaning is an over generalization though.I think that sub is ironic\s\sEdit: either way their memes are kinda shit nglUnfortunately progressive types aren't typically into forming shady cabals bent on brainwashing and radicalizing groups of youth. The alt-right saw the vast potential of angry disaffected young white men who spend the majority of their lives online and ran with it. And we on the left are once again shocked at just how evil these evil fucks are.This is what capitalism does. It steals what others make and claims the credit. It doesn't make games or music or cars or food it just makes those who do do so for less while selling the product to those who need/want it for more.\s\sIt elevates the middleman to overlord.\s\sAs for the lack of diversity this is also the consequence of capitalism. Until the game crash in the '80s a lot of women worked in all parts of the industry. Women have been major contributers since modern computers were invented (women here too). We got to this place when Nintendo went to the toy industry to sell its wares because the toy industry was divided into boys toys and girls toys. Nintendo went with the boys model and the rest is history.>This is what capitalism does. It steals what others make and claims the credit.

This hurts.[deleted]The entire debacle is a form of weaponized identity politics.\s\sYou ignore the class issues and weaponize an identity.\s\sCorrupt journalists needed a distraction from their own inept failings.  They attacked their audience.  Hence: Gamergate.\s\sSome people believe the corrupt narrative of the journalists that gamers are vile misogynistic right wingers who attack women on the regular.\s\s... Ignoring the fact that women are in the industry on every level as men...\s\sThe class issues are what you see above.  The identity is when you have everyone INSIST that nothing but straight white males attack feminists.\s\sOnce you've strawmanned the audience you can create blame on people instead of finding ways to solve [problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/cnicm9/how_propaganda_works_casting_blame_on_people/) as I pointed out months ago.\s\sGamergate is nothing more than the earlier version of the Bernie Bro attack in a more raw form.  Weaponize an identity attack it and watch the fearmongering that occurs.I don't think gamers have been lost to the right even the male dominated gamespace (FPS/Sports) I would say there is a good mix. In fact when I played COD type games many of us put aside political differences to play together.\s\sI do not think the gamergate folks (on either side) are a sizable portion of the gaming community. I could be wrong being as my first console was the 2600 in 1979 though.Easy: the loudest gamers are incels. Incels are by default right wing.Loudest?Honestly I don't even know if thats true I play a lot of games and talk to lots of people within those spheres and they are all completely seperate from the Incels. 99.999% of the chatter in these communities are pretty normal and without the degeneracy we see from Incels.\s\sIt's not fair to say Incels are the loudest gamers but that they are a seperate group entirely.Look at the endless stream of insults...  Gee I wonder why they don't like you?No sarcasm; this is a pretty woke metaphor.In the 90s it was the evangelicals trying to censor and vilify video games as a corrupting tool of the devil. Somewhere along the way the SJWs took over their crusade against free expression in storytelling.\s\sIt wouldn't be hard to add to his list regarding greed in gaming though. A side effect of the digital distribution model has been doing away with the used game market-- you don't actually own your games anymore you're just purchasing the right to download and play it and gone are the days of $5 bargain bin deals or selling off games that you're done with. The cost of games has generally gone down quite a bit and that's always nice but somehow the big titles still try to sell for $60.  There are titles that aren't getting rereleases or sequels because of big companies sitting on the IP uninterested in doing anything with it and/or sending cease and desist letters to shut down fan projects.\s\sI don't think one can realistically *blame* capitalism for the direction gaming has gone but the parallels are certainly there.I mean the ""$5 bargain bin"" has only gotten bigger though you're really only *actually* buying games from a few places notably GOG most every other store is essentially an extended rentalThe gaming ""press"" calling gamers sexist and racist while participating in payola for the big gaming companies can tend to do that.  Pushing a social IDPol agenda instead focusing on good games or the valid real criticisms the tweeter mentions is fake news.Why do you think I made /r/ClassGaming ?\s\sThere needs to be a serious class look at the fact that gaming has been a major distraction point for lefties where more people need to actually look at and acknowledge those issues or we'll be deeper in cyberpunk BS than we already are.Actually that was a few years ago. In last 1-2 years the gaming community as a whole is turning against gaming captializing and is shifting left.They‚Äôre shifting populist and anti-neolib/corporate.  There are plenty of people who lean right that are also increasingly fed up with the increasing corruption and grotesque greed of neolib corporatism.\s\sWhile simultaneously more existing leftists are increasingly rejecting idpol ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù that is trashing all manner of various IPs in the name of its misbegotten ideology.\s\sWe see a similar dynamic happening in wider media entertainment in everything from comics to film.  But gaming was something of the canary in the coal mine and was ahead by a few years in rebelling against corporate ‚Äúwoke‚Äù idpol and their media shills trying to tell them what to think plundering beloved franchises and IPs and falsely accusing of bigotry any and everybody who dared disagree.Dunno about shifting ""left"" though definitely a backlash against capitalists being capitalists - in an industry that directly affects them.""shifting left"" ""shifting right""\s\sYou and OP are both guilty of painting with far too wide a brush.Saying that gaming has become a right leaning media is a pretty stupid generalization to make. Just by looking at the average age of gamers you can guess that far more are probably left leaning in their political views. Plus the gaming community hates p2w mechanics lootboxes and microtransactions which are all bullshit capitalist methods of scamming more money out of gamers (especially children).I think it‚Äôs more referring to those who refer to themselves as ‚Äúgamers‚Äù and referring to things like gamer gate.Nahh I'm a leftie and a gamer. Some people are just garbage.They don't mean that literally all gamers are right-wing but there is *definitely* a problem with a large number of gamers getting sucked into alt-right holes and misogyny and racism have been a problem in the gaming community for a long time now even before the rise of the alt-right.I don‚Äôt agree with the position that gamers are conservative. I think they‚Äôre painted as alt-Righters by the media and your great aunt who thinks they cause mass shootings but I‚Äôve met soooooo many gamers who are socialists. \s\sI think if you study the types of games that people play you might be able to find a correlation between ideology but it won‚Äôt be salient. \s\sI‚Äôm also of the opinion that ideology isn‚Äôt salient either. People change their mind and ascribe themselves to new world views frequently. Gamers probably will too.These people are controlled by media. They can't even think logically. Why do you think media claims all that crap against gamers and games? Gaming is one of the biggest source entertainment. It's also a business which should tell you the desperate and obvious attempts media comes up with to bring gaming down.Ironically the consumer annoyance at these things is making gaming great again.Right? Biggest let down for me was Destiny 2 but it got flamed so bad (rightly so) that Bungie split with Activision over it and took back creative authority over their game.Speaking as someone who plays a lot of video games and even made some mods for Fallout New Vegas it's most likely because gamers are the dumbest fucking morons on planet earthThis is a good example of how to ""lose the gamers"". Acting like this dude right here letting your insecurities get the best of you throwing a childish tantrum and insulting a massive and diverse group of people.\s\sAnyway nobody's ""lost the gamers"". Gamers are pretty much everyone nowadays. There's a very specific section of people that's ""lost"" but there's some truth in that last paragraph: Manufactured outrage virtue signalling and the whole victim-for-profit mentality has made the left easier to dismiss. People that engage in such theatrics and misinformation should be shunned by either ""side"".I disagree.I think ‚Äúdumbest fucking morons‚Äù is a bit harsh. \s\sThey‚Äôre mostly a bunch of middle class white guys who know a decent amount about maybe two things and live in a toxic cognitive bias echo chamber.Self included?""But I have choice; I get to choose which micortransactions I do rather than question the validity for why I have to make them in the first place if the marketplace had actually brought me good value.""The r/modernwarfare community is exactly what you‚Äôre talking about. One of the top posts for the month is essentially ‚Äúhey we don‚Äôt have to buy lootboxes so this new form of MTX is way better even though we purchased a game for $60 that will get re released in ~365 days‚Äù \s\sCOD is the perfect example for the flaws of capitalism. They release the same game every year and they still break records even though the people playing and paying for it aren‚Äôt satisfied.\s\sEdit: the second post that the bot linked is the one I‚Äôm talking about on this post btw.How many people upvoting this are actually gamers?I certainly amI am. My cousins in Scotland are the epitome of who was targeted by Steve Bannon and their manufactured gamergate fiasco. They have shifted from good people to people who are hateful towards everyone who isn‚Äôt like them because they failed to learn how to socialize never bothered with schoolwork their appearance interpersonal skills or mental health. They are now cynical and vindictive and genuinely are happy at others failures because those people are now more like them (though they will never admit that)\s\sIt‚Äôs a tragedy that they were so easily manipulated.MeYo\s\sIn fact i occasionally use the gaming industry as an example of why capitalism is straight up terrible. as it's a relatively new industry one that hasn't been taken seriously for very long and an artistic one it is a great way to study the world some of these idiots want to bring about.\s\sIt's almost literally the perfect example of how a lack of regulation guarantees abuse by corpo dogs and how capitalism stifles art and progress in general.Probably a lot of them. \s\sI don't think ""capitalism"" is the right word but it's also not a wrong word.  Blaming ""corporatist greed"" or ""anti-consumer industry practices unmitigated by regulation"" would be better than saying ""capitalism"" but we all know what is being said here and it rings true.\s\sGamers haven't been this ripped-off deceived and screwed over since 1983.\s\sAnd yeah I know what that last sentence is referring to even if I disagree with the phrasing of ""all gamers think..."".  Obviously I'm a gamer and don't think like that.  But I took the phrase in the sense of ""That's all some think"" not ""they all think"".  I would have worded things differently but I know what this poster is talking about and agree 100%.Gamer here.People clinging to a cultural identity rather than a class identity should not be surprising to people with some historical awareness.[deleted][deleted]Why do I have a feeling that most of the pro-capitalism and ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù posts on here are from people that think a capitalist system is the only way to achieve these photo-realistic graphics? \s\sBecause if you really think about it the only breakout innovation from the last few development cycles has been on graphical fidelity.having games run and look well is a pretty integral part of gaming so many major developers both console and game are focused on making their games look as good as PC and run as well and PC part producers and game devs are always trying to look better than other games on PC.\s\sthat being said VR has been cultivated and developed by many major developers. valve has been huge in investing it. boneworks is an example of how far VR has came. no one would be developing it that much if there was not competition for it.\s\si would say that nintendo has outdid themselves with this generation's games. they have remodeled what it means to be a zelda game with botw they have improved and innovated odyssey past what other mario games have done before. they have to because the customer gets tired of the same old stuff over and over again. if they want to make money and be successful they had to innovate.\s\sgamers tend so much to focus on the negative. people in general do. that's because they feel the need to fix them. it's definitely a good thing that they don't turn a cold shoulder to them but they often forget just how good games can really be and how much good content there is out there.In mainstream triple A games yes but small games like Pathologic 2 are changing the way you think games are supposed to treat you instead of a power fantasy it‚Äôs exploring themes like futility and helplessness instead of instant gratification skinner boxesWhat role do videogames play in a planned economy?[Jim Sterling is required viewing. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S-DGTBZU14)Well said.Let's fully ignore all the game ""journalists"" calling gamers sexist racist and homophobic and all the other ""ists"" under the sun while not calling out micro transactions loot crates pay to win  etc...\s\s&#x200B;\s\sCapitalists(left and right) brought all those and they used identity politics as a lubricant.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sJust like right now you see big corporations slapping rainbow flags on while they continue to screw everyone for profit.

It's saying ""the things the right wing has pushed for have come through in our games.""I don't know any gamers who like any of those thingsYes everyone that partakes in a particular hobby is by default assigned some binary political bias 'left or right'. All Kayakers are hard right wing nationalists. Do you people not understand how absurdly stupid it is to generalize the political bias of literally 100's of millions of people.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sYes scumbag companies like EA;  have shitty business practices. But capitalism also enabled companies like Intel/AMD/Nvidia to constantly improve their hardware every generation (Moores law) empowering game developers to create more and more realistic and complex games every year. Please explain how under your socialist utopia the government will spend billions on global servers just for the use of gaming? How the government will spend billions on improving Graphics cards every year?Moore's law has been broken for years and for 10 years Intel has led the CPU market by so much that when AMD finally caught up they were force to drop prices SIGNIFICANTLY showing that they had been charging unfair rates. Likewise Nvidia is still ripping off consumers by charging high mark ups because there is not enough competition. Capitalism does not drive innovation competition does. American capitalism is anti competitive.[deleted]You didn't lose gamers to the right. Gamers are a demographic not a community. We don't act as anything resembling a cohesive group. In fact we fight amongst ourselves so much that its foolish to think even more than half of us share the exact same opinion on anything. What you might be seeing is a vocal minority scared that the quality of the games they love so much will be compromised by political correctness (a fear I do not happen to share).Capitalists pretend that if the big companies did something wrong the market would immediately punish them. The reality is that there is a difference between good and profitable. From the viewpoint of profit there is a balance between driving people away and making extra money off the people who stay. In extreme cases some studios make games specifically designed to survive off a handful of ""whales"" i.e. players who spend an extreme amount on microtransactions. Capitalists pretend the market will instantly correct itself but in reality being a big name has a lot of value. A franchise like ""Halo"" could take a lot of mediocrity before the current fans actually give up. A game could be just as good as ""Halo: Combat Evolved"" but still struggle in obscurity. Big companies can afford a lot of marketing and gaming journalists need those ad dollars to survive. Reviewers are unfortunately hesitant to give bad scores to big names. Capitalists pretend that capitalism will always result in growth the reality is that businesses will often attempt to grow regardless of how bad their chances. Sometimes people make promises they can't keep just to keep their jobs another year. A lot of franchises dumb down sequels and reboots in an attempt to gain new fans and take their old fans for granted. E.A. keeps buying good game companies and then ruining them. Telling the board of directors ""We tried but failed!"" is better than seeking stable profits under capitalism. Most hardcore gamers recognize these problems and they protest but a round of protests can't fix everything.\s\sI believe that ""GamerGate"" was caused by a desire to defend the established gamer identity. Human psychology requires some sort of self description and a lot of people call themselves as ""gamers"". They understand themselves through this label and thus their psyche depends on there being a certain understanding to what the word means. There are theories in sociology and psychology that suggest that identifying with a label can change your behavior and your beliefs about yourself to be closer to the stereotype. The gamer stereotype is very close to the nerds and geeks which in turn is largely based on the dichotomy with the popular and athletic jock. If you look up the origin of the words ""nerd"" and ""geek"" were originally general purpose insults. Nerds geeks and gamers are usually assumed to be male. We've heard of ""geek girls"" but how often do you have to say ""geek boy"" to specify males. In addition a big part of the stereotype is that they can't get the girl. Dont' forget the industry specifically marketed to boys for decades and most of the heroes are muscular athletic men relying on their physical prowess to survive. So you have a lot of men who see gaming as a refuge for men who have failed at achieving popularity and physical prowess. There are both outsiders who look down on the community and gamers who carry internalized shame and both of those result in a tendency towards defensiveness and outrage.\s\sA precursor to gamergate was the ""fake geek girl"" outrage. Some of the rants made it sound like there was a literal succubus occupying the convention floor but more common was the concern that those who were less interested in geek stuff were inserting themselves into geek spaces namely women. I think when you identify with ""can't get the girl"" running into an attractive women with the same interests can feel like a threat. At best you have to ask if you really want a girlfriend and maybe improve your grooming habits. At worst  incel community has become doomsday cult based entirely on the belief that they can't get the girl.\s\sThree events a few months apart triggered gamergate. First professional feminist Anita Sarkeesian announced a series criticizing sexism in games. They didn't wait to see the actual criticizm but they could predict what she would say and they hated it. There was a back lash and a back lash against the back lash. People gave her money to prove they weren't sexist because the criticizms needed to be made. Feminists analyze and criticize and deconstruct every facet of culture and point out sexism everywhere. Gamergate did not start with a change in the behavior of the feminist community. Second Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend accused her of cheating of having sex with a guy in order to get a good review and a lot of people sided with him without a second thought. Fun fact the guy she supposedly slept with never reviwed her game. Often exes accuse eachother of cheating and random people take sides but it is rare that it becomes a controversy worthy of its own name. Third several gaming journalists wrote articles about the toxic behavior of ""gamers"" and about maybe the gaming industry doesn't really need hardcore gamers after all. Of course if you have an identity based on video games and the people who make video games turn against you you naturally go ballistic.\s\sGamergaters insisted that people accept games and the gaming community ""as-is"". The idea that you would change anything was unacceptable. Theoretically gamergate wasn't sexist but attempts to address sexism within gaming were treated as attacks by outside forces. Women who complained about sexism were fake geek girls. Anti-gamergaters embraced the possibility for change. It seems that both sides had reasonable people and toxic people but generally the toxic voices drowned out the others. With the decentralized nature the toxic people the harrassers and screamers could essentially hide behind the others. Because there were both good and bad people could behave badly and then claim the movement as a whole was good.\s\sThe proto-alt-right found a good recruitment ground because traditional ideas about maleness and whiteness also came under attack and the alt-right is all about defending the traditional concepts of maleness and whiteness. Gamergate certainly claimed to be inclusive but they were very insecure about their masculinity they needed games that uphold certain masculine ideals even if they couldn't live up to those ideals in real life. Whiteness wasn't quite as important but they were accused of racism and they were mostly white and the stereotype of the gamer/geek/nerd is usually a white guy. I have even seen nerd stereotypes described as stereotypes about white people occasionally as if blacks don't play DnD. The alt-right works like a cult except instead of religion you have the white male identity. Like some cults there are multiple levels of belief the topmost levels seem pretty innocent and reasonable the deepest levels are dangerous and deranged. From ""I hate SJWs"" to ""I hate Jews"". Like a cult they typically recruit people who lack identity and community and then provide easy answers. Like a cult they are both abusive and comforting. Like a cult they don't like it when you apply logic to their beliefs and if you really need them for that community and sense of identity you usually won't.>I believe that ""GamerGate"" was caused by a desire to defend the established gamer identity. \s\s...

Some of that criticism might have been in response to the over-woke state of the gaming press that was overly fond of calling gamers sexist and racist.  The paid for by big companies gaming press of course responded by calling the critics racist and sexist.\s\sYou can see the same response to criticism of the current Star Wars trilogy where the press is fond of calling critics sexist and racist as the paid-for marketing arm  of Big-Co Disney.

It's only internet hysteria that's convinced people it's simple and you need to pick a side.This only applies to AmericaAre they though?\s\sAny way you look at it that's simply not trueI've more or less quit gaming and started exclusively playing tabletop RPGsAnger + Ignorance always = The RightA lot of ‚Äògamers‚Äô and people on the right in general are very critical of capitalism and corporations due to the fact that they like to milk ‚Äòwoke‚Äô  ‚ÄòSJW‚Äô politics for money. It‚Äôs not as simple as this.Why do pro-capitalism gamers think they get to tell corporations how they should go about making their money.  That‚Äôs literally the exact opposite of capitalism.  You‚Äôre entire comment is utter nonsense.Well the problem is that those idpol obsessed Radlibs are too much associated with the left. Promote a class orientated left wing movement and gamers will be on board ‚ÄòSJW‚Äô pandering is absolutely embarrassing and as long as people think that is the left there is not going to be mainstream support.What you just described is bigots being upset that capitalism is not tailored 100% to them. Nothing makes a conservative angrier than being given information that challenges their world views.Nobody on the right is critical of capitalism the example you just gave is not right wingers being genuinely concerned with the exploitation of ‚ÄúSJW‚Äùs under capitalism they‚Äôre just upset that ideas they dislike are being represented in media they consumeExcept people keep buying those games.The FIFA reskins that are sold at full retail price.I‚Äôll just leave this here. https://youtu.be/IYkLVU5UGM8I don't know what any of this means but epicRise up gamers against the chad that is capitalism.\s\s\sWe live in a society.ive never given an award before but i legit did a spit take on this one. you earned it.Yeah gamers rise up.They will just sit back down with laboured breathing as sweat drips down their sweaty chins and stains the XXX-L shirts they are wearingJust gonna put [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBfBuuG_cN4) here\s\sCredit to u/CondescendingFaggotGaming is escapism to which there is no escape from the onset. And so we are confronted with the things we seek to escape as an escape.\s\sAnd so at least it isn't like drugs where we impair our judgment and fall asleep and care not for the actions of others but it is an escape where we learn to fight not in social context but individual. And ideologies are just fragmented incoherent remnants that are wholly intact in our nature but scattered about our perceptions in a mass media chaos that frame aspects as wholes and we are left to find that our great escape takes us nowhere but that is enough.\s\sAnd so games kill time and if it makes us feel it was time well spent it's a good game. If not it is a profane incoherent mess that we would have no trouble making for ourselves thanks to how we frame fragments as wholes in a mass media consumerist mindset.Same thing with the job market.

They‚Äôre blaming feminism and diversity for the stupid ass censorship in many AAA games. COD WW2 censored the Swastica and even made it so you could play as a black female nazi. It‚Äôs covering up history simply because it might offend some stupid people.\s\sPlayers are blaming these shit AAA companies for the decline in gaming because they‚Äôre using shitty-money grubbing practices that are extremely effective. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all.\s\sThis is why there has been a massive resurgence in indie gaming and smaller game studios they aren‚Äôt controlled by massive corporate dickheads   and they respect their consumers. \s\sIt‚Äôs less about politics and more about the devs being either nice or just being assholes. Just keep voting with your wallet like everyone else and the gaming climate will change like it has already been doing.[deleted]How do I retweet a comment on Reddit.COD WW2 never promised historical accuracy I don't even like the game but this argument has always been stupid.\sAlso if we go that route appealing to the social justice crowd is also a part of Capitalism and the profit motive.I quit gaming just before x1 came out ironically enough because I couldn't afford it not because I wanted to. And boy I'm glad I did. Do not want to be a part of that community.I mean I think the vast majority of gamers are pretty liberal. After all we skew younger and more educated. It's just that especially after gamergate was subverted by the right it's become very easy to radicalize gamers since we tend to be more asocial are bullied more often and therefore feel a vague level of marginalization from society. This makes it easy for right wing extremists to blame things like PC culture and minorities for all of one's problems rather than the inherently unequal society in which we live.This post makes it sound like the people who complain about virtuesignaling in videogames don't complain about micro transactions. Which is pretty much not true.The post makes exactly the opposite point that gamers complain intensely about microtransactions but don't follow their hatred to its logical conclusion: hatred of unregulated free market capitalism.you guys understand that there is a difference in economical and social politic opinions right?Let me guess economically conservative and socially liberal right?\s\s‚ÄúI smoke weed but fuck the poor people!‚ÄùBut not reallyThey don't seem toYeah totally. Minorities suffering is really really bad but all the things that cause it? Those are really good actually.People... capitalism is defined by the private ownership of capital. Private ownership of capital does not lead to video games. Human creativity mixed with modern technology and science leads to video games. Private ownership of capital does not lead to the evolution of video games. Artistic passion and scientific ingenuity combined with an ever-evolving technology leads to the evolution of video games.\s\sSo what does private ownership of capital lead to? Exploitation and monopolization. That's it. Capitalist companies are like tiny monarchies or plutocratic republics and like their historical ancestors the only thing they know how to do is accumulate resources. They don't innovate they don't grow they just eat. \s\sSo what about socialism you ask? Well socialism is the de-privatization of ownership of capital. This is actually more broad than you think so I'll start off by saying that no communism isn't the only form of socialism that exists and no other forms of socialism don't lead to communism. With that being said there would be video games in socialism just as much they exist under capitalism. Whether or not they would be the same is what's up in the air but socialism would be no more the cause of video games than capitalism is. The fundamental thing that concerns capitalism and socialism is who owns what not who makes what.Not even wrong.educate yourself before you write another bullshit post[deleted]Okay you want an actual answer from someone who's been in GamerGate since nearly the start and the various controversies that led up to it?\s\s1: We're not all right wing.  Anti-SJW =/= right.  There are a lot of right-wing anti-SJWs sure but there's also lefties among our ranks.  I'm currently Yang Gang but I'd happily vote for Bernie if he takes the primary I've liked him for years you can check my post history if you want proof.  A lot of us are lefties who became anti-SJWs did so because we were horrified to watch our own team become a mirror image of the religious right pushing moral panic about media and trying to censor violence and sex appeal.  And don't give me some ""only the government can censor"" canned retort I can bust out everything from the OED to the ACLU to prove that's not the definition of censorship.\s\s2: Beyond regulating loot box gambling which most GamerGaters support we don't really see a governmental or socialist fix to the current situation.  It's the creative arts we're talking about.  What's the government gonna do?  Will there be bureaucrats who decide when a game is sufficiently bug-free and content complete to be released?  Will they dictate balance changes to avoid pay to win?  Forbid DLC?  Tell developers how much story they have to include before they can make a sequel or expansion pack?  Somehow dictate innovation?  That sounds absurd and unworkable on its face.  I just don't see any kind of top-down government-driven solution here that doesn't result in state control of content in the creative arts.  That's scary in any form of media but a total non-starter in video games which our politicians left and right have time and again demonstrated they don't understand and are happy to scapegoat and demonize for votes.  Frankly all I see happening here and what I think people who WANT more socialism in gaming are looking for is taxpayer funded grants for artsy indie studios so they can make woke walking simulators no one wants to play and not go broke.  I really just don't see government involvement producing Mortal Kombat but without the shitty microtransactions.\s\sTo be clear many of the problems relating to how the industry treats its WORKERS can be solved through socialistic means strikes unions collective bargaining all good tools for combating unacceptable working conditions in the games industry.  But this post was about how the industry treats its CUSTOMERS so I'm sticking to that.\s\s3: Gaming's problems while yes are certainly a great example of capitalism run amok can only really be solved in a bottom-up way through grassroots consumer activism.  Boycotts mostly standing in solidarity with our fellow gamers and DEMANDING better than what these companies give us or we'll take our dollars somewhere else.  Certainly that kind of collective action has a tinge of class warfare to it but it's also reliant on free market competition.\s\sAnd we used to have a great advocate and leader for that movement a person who had built up the clout and the audience to take the big companies to task and hold them accountable and who unlike the games press we rebelled against was utterly incorruptible.  His name was Totalbiscuit and he fought for gamers literally to his last breath.  But because he disagreed with Anita Sarkeesian and thought fighting nepotism and corruption in the press was a goal worth supporting (and certainly what was going on in the games press is an egregious example of crony capitalism in and of itself) gaming's supposed advocates for social justice smeared and shamed and tried to ruin him WHILE HE WAS DYING OF CANCER!  I'm not gonna say they killed him but people do say one's mindset matters a lot in such battles so if he hadn't been facing such hate and negativity while he fought his disease maybe just maybe the outcome would have been different.  At the end of the day he was the best shot we had against the capitalist excesses of the big game publishers but all the SJWs cared about was pushing their authoritarian identity politics.  They didn't want power to the people in gaming just to themselves.  Hence ""gamers are dead"" and all that.  Gamers have never known anything but contempt from SJWs of course we rebelled against it.  You want a frame of reference?  THIS was one of the major figures on the anti-GamerGate social justice side:\s\shttps://i.imgur.com/BWI9txJ.jpg\s\shttps://i.imgur.com/zMhZXj2.png\s\shttps://external-preview.redd.it/vwP0iOw44p13qhIJcFkGrxMo2TjspDUewAwLVQgQhIk.jpg?auto=webp&s=93042450da9d4bb6c04254205dc44d1e18d323f6\s\sReal proletariat champion there.  Gamers are not gonna side with that and we're not gonna side with people who countenance it in the name of owning the manbabies or whatever.\s\sFuck look up the Mass Effect 3 ending debacle or the the DMC ""entitled gamers"" incident.  Every time we TRIED to rebel against big capital in gaming against their insistence that we accept crappy or incomplete products for our money the same oh-so-woke and leftist games press outlets that gamers ultimately told to fuck off in 2014 sided with the companies and shamed us for ""entitlement"" and ""getting too angry"".\s\sI still believe a lot of the people in GamerGate who DID ultimately drift right can be won back.  But it's the left's responsibility to reach out rebuild those bridges listen to our stories and treat gamer activism as legitimate instead of demonizing it as everything from a ""harassment campaign"" to literally terrorism.  You can't just keep shaming and berating people and imagining you can win them over through eventually breaking them down.  You want gamers back?  Earn them back.  And please do it sooner rather than later I don't want another four years of the clown in chief before the left actually learns this lesson.\s\sEdit: You can downvote if you like but I'm not actually the one who needs to convince anybody.  You're the ones who want to get people to vote for your guy I'm just giving you advice how to do it.I'm left but the sjw shit is mostly just over exaggerated label to condemn someone you disagree with.

COD any sport games for example. \sStuffs that you needed is one thing stuffs that entertain you is another. Also gaming has never been better amazing titles coming out each years.\sSTOP BUYING SHITTY GAMES.Almost any big game right now will feature some kind of a shitty mechanic. Saying ‚Äúdont buy shitty games‚Äù is like telling people not to buy the latest AAA title. (Tho sometimes its been soo terrible that people must refused buy yes battlefront 2)No? Gaming culture is a perfect example of free market capitalism. I don‚Äôt like Call of Duty because of their scummy practices so why no play one of the millions of extremely good AA games that has devs that listen to the community? Rust and Escape from Tarkov come to mind there are plenty of great AAA games too I‚Äôve spent a whole lot of time in Rainbow. If you fund AAA while hating it‚Äôs practices you are dumb and are a bad consumer.It is not about economic policy it is about social policy. In other words the gamers that complain don‚Äôt do so based on economic ideology they are critics of the left due to a consistent campaign calling them misogynistics racists etc... and obviously this generated the opposite effect the ones accusing them wanted instead of ‚Äúself-correcting‚Äù to adjust their behavior to the language and PC culture that dominates other forms of entertainment like cinema tv series or novels they felt insulted and maybe radicalized their position as they didn‚Äôt accepted being ‚Äúshamed‚Äù by the media which has a long history of trying to demonize gaming as a source of bad social behavior (‚Äúit generates violence murders etc...‚Äù)\s\sEven today the left media keeps doing the same mistake with the whole gamergate scandal they refuse to back down on the accusations instead of accepting their responsibility for the problems generated with that collusion between the specialized media and some Indy developers that though they could make it in the market by selling virtue signaling even if the product lacked any quality. I think a part of the left didn‚Äôt took into account that gaming is an interactive source of entertainment and they couldn‚Äôt dictate the experience just by influencing the corporate culture within the companies creating the products. In other words the user has a voice while a shaming strategy only works if the accused has no good way to defend themselves. They felt attacked as a community just like before only now the accusations were that gaming generates sexism or racism instead of murderers.\s\sIf anything this shows how ideology influences companies in entertainment just as much as they do on media companies and that the advancement of said ideological narratives is not coming within society but from a relatively small part of it even if they pretend to speak for a whole generation.\s\sThe strategy was wrong and even unethical at different levels and the outcome is an increase in polarization. Let‚Äôs not forget the same companies that pander to the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù crowd are the same that stablish the pricing strategies that collect more utility from the selling than a single price under an efficient market which is what capitalism is supposed to generate except under excesses of market power by the companies. Meanwhile the same people that signal themselves as champions of the people and have influenced said companies from within or through the media companies have no shame in trying to use that influence to get a piece of that cake. The end result? The consumer get the worst of both political perspectives.Its worth noting that whole gamergate started not with gamers being against left social politics. It was attack of gamers on journalists for lack of integrity and selling good reviews. Than jpurnalists started to scream about sexist gamers.[deleted]Except literally anyone who is anything can also be a gamer as well gamers as a whole are a diverse group. I can tell you that my friends from gaming are a lot more diverse than my friends from the schools and jobs attended just because the population of gamers comes from the entire planet instead of the people in just your own country/neighborhoods. I daresay that people who think western issues even effect all gamers let alone that gamers or game developers have a duty to fight for a specific western cause are severely misunderstanding who ""gamers"" actually are.Nah this opinion aint it....NoThe amount of gamer/incel overlap is profoundly shocking.Not really that stereotype has been around since gaming first became popular[deleted][deleted]It took a bite and thought it was delicious so it stayed for the long term.I genuinely don‚Äôt understand what hardcore sjw ideology ruined gaming. Examples?this is not a political issue. it is about gamers forgetting that we are supposed to play games to escape reality and have fun.\s\si believe the root cause of the gaming issues over microtransactions and loot box gambling etc. is due to social media.\s\si started playing video games as a kid when my dad brought home pong in the mid 70s. then upgraded to an atari 2600 a few years later. throughout the 80s i owned just about every gaming system that ever came out. pretty sure my dad still has all of the systems in the attic back home.\s\sas i enjoy many of the current pc and console games of today i really couldn't care less about having a $3000 knife or $2000 outfit. i still get the same enjoyment wearing whatever i started the game with on day one.\s\ssocial media game forums peers etc. puts unwarranted pressure on gamers to have the coolest gear and accessories. the sooner everyone stops worrying about what others think of them the sooner they can lead a much more happy and satisfying life. try it for yourself you will see that it is true. cheers!I think you're off base here. A lot of people really enjoy collecting things and customizing their characters. Even in single player games. It sucks that what used to be part of the game unlocking cool collectables is now just a massive pay wall.\s\sJust because it's not something you enjoy it why you played games didn't mean it doesn't massively affect the enjoyment for a lot of peopleHence is why I play ‚ÄúThe Long Dark‚ÄùWithout capitalism there would be no games or at least none worth playingI play Tetris 12 hours a day.Uh the Soviet Union has video games..Tetris?Without capitalism there wouldn't be any YOBA shit true.\s\sThe games would actually be fucking good.\s\sAlso I'd rather create a wooden AK-47 in a FREE after-school activity at the workshop and play fucking war with other kids if we decide to go about games in the USSR.yep fucking moronsYou talking shit on gamers asshole?This is an odd take.  Games are doing great and we've seen some amazing games over the past decade.  Game publishers have occasional missteps as they figure out how to sell games across multiple countries and cultures and this frequently results in a sales scheme that often little sense to western countries.  For instance you aren't going to have the best experience if you're playing a game on your home PC that was designed for hour long play sessions in an internet cafe.  There have of course been some very high profile failures in gaming as well but it's far from the standard.  This take only makes sense if you believe that all games are suffering from all the problems that happen in any game.  If you read articles about games but didn't play many than this may seem like a reasonable position to take.\s\sWere gamers lost to the right?  No of course not and you're pretty silly to think so.  Gamers are by necessity extremely cosmopolitan.  If you play enough games over enough time you inevitably find yourself playing with people from countries all over the world and your ability to enact any sort of racist or sexist life goal is limited by gaming's inherent anonymity.  Dave Chappelle's blind KKK member sketch is a pretty good example of how hard it would be to be racist as a gamer over the long term.  This does lend gamers a strong libertarian bent as they frequently deal with international embargoes ethno-centric localization decisions and threats to that anonymity.  That being the case hearing accusations that gamers are inexplicably able to make race and sex based decisions despite ubiquitous anonymity hits as little more than a sad punch line.\s\sI couldn't tell you what gaming would be like without capitalism but it's pretty satisfying with it.[deleted]I'm about to blow your whole world but most alt-right people I've come into contact with despise capitalism and see it as a jewish system....Progress??\s\sAlso those people are called nazbols and as far as I know are a vast minority.Except they also think that Trump is also on their side.i've spent countless hours gaming more than most ppl i'd like to think.  logging 20000 hr's into FFXI in the early 2000's and 10000hr's into dota 2 not to mention a few thousand into cs:s amongst other titles.  and i've learned something in all my years of gaming....... what a waste of fkin time =/\s\si started wondering lately ""what if i worked all those hours i gamed away"".  even at the measily hours above at min wage that'd be 300000$.   #WhenYouRealizeHowMuchOfYourLifeYouWastedDueToGaming\s\s&#x200B;\s\swords of advice from a person who moved back home due to fiance leaving him when he was 22yrs old - go to college find your dream job find your wife have some kids go to their soccer games socialize have a good life.\s\si blinked and now i'm 36 too absorbed in video games.  i could literally have earned half a million working.\s\s\- my two cents on the last paragraph of the post feminism and diversity isn't ruining video games what's ruining video games is no eff'n content.  it's like game developers zapped their brains and forgot how to make an eff'n game.  and you guys eattin the shtty games up like they candy.  ffxi in the early 2000's is probably the only game in this day n age i could sink 20000 hours into.  i know a few ppl that sunk more than that into eve online but games these days have zero content.  same crap over n over same map over n over one game becomes successful and a dozen clones pop up within the year; and here's the sad part... THOSE GAMES AREN'T EVEN THAT FKIN GOOD.  u guys payin 60-80 bucks for a game that has 1 or 2 weeks worth of content and you act like it's the most amazing thing in the world.. lol man i want my star citizen ... open world.. space warring ... etc.. man.  by now there should be a game where you can do ANYTHING.  u wanna be a space pilot?   a space marine?  you wanna be an intergalactic trader?  or maybe just be the mayor of a city on some rando planet.   we have quantum processors already so whats the problem... shouldn't be that hard to make a decent game.    they keep pushin that crappy VR.. lol here's the thing there's nothing virtual about that crap it's just a cellphone 2 inches from ur face u can sit 2 inches from your monitor and have the same effect.  ppl are so dumb.I agree with the ""no Content"" statement. It's the reason i stopped buying games for their content. Nowadays i basically just get what ever lets me play with my friends. Gaming has become a way to socialize with friends for me. Spending time with them. If i'd still play for the games i'd be really depressed by the state of the industry.\s\sThe last time i enjoyed a game for it's content and story a game that made me lose weeks and months to it was Diablo 2. Nothing since then ever grabbed me like that and i still play it today here and there. Other than that i can't remember the last time i scrolled through steam and found something i thought was interesting. I haven't bought a single game because i thought it looked new or interesting in 2 or 3 years.\s\sI've dialed back my gaming considerably. Not because i have to just because there's nothing interesting to do in PC Gaming. I'm looking forward to Diablo 4 and Cyberpunk but my gut tells me they will also be all hype and no content (me hoping i'm wrong).\s\sOn the upside i spend considerably more time playing guitar and learning to Program for linux now. I count that as a plus overall.It‚Äôs quite simple the users dictate the market stop putting your money into shitty gamesUsers CAN dictate the market.  But right now game studios all want to be ~~Zynga~~ King and get that phat micro-transaction cash.  And if you call out Blizzard for selling out with a Diablo re-skin of a Chinese mobile game or their in game store in Diablo III you are clearly racist and sexist to boot!PongPing?While I agree with most of this he's forgetting that capitalism isn't the cause of this. It's demand for stuff like this. I mean look at Call of Duty and Battlefield they release almost the same game every single year and yet it is greeted with amazing sales. This means there is a demand for stuff like that and if companies are getting away with it they will keep on doing it. If we actually wanted to do something about this we would send backlash towards those companies making the games like this. Look at Battlefront 2 the game is now completely changed from what it used to be. It is now a good game that isn't really pay to win. Because it was met with backlash from people who didn't want it that way so capitalism isn't the issue here.He's critiquing capitalism as a system that does not take into account human flaws. Not everyone can be perfectly informed about every product. Especially when the company selling the games can buy off reviewers or create armies of bots to spread positivity about the game. \s\sAlso it's a few whales that make a lot of this shit feasible to sell. A lot of games are still enjoyable outside of the loot systems so people don't want to boycott just for because of that and the vast majority don't buy microtransactions. It's just a few whales that keep this bullshit alive and can degrade the game.\s\sIf the game was just an open source profit free project it would be free from the bullshit that comes from greed. They would just try to make an enjoyable game.\s\sHowever I can see the other side of the argument that without capitalism we would not have such huge beautifully rendered games.Interesting to read to blame a system while its people who lack integrity and get into corruption.What do you think systems are developed and run by?It‚Äôs not a problem with capitalism it‚Äôs a problem with gamers. 1st I don‚Äôt understand how op expects communism to fix it. 2nd the thing is because of capitalism the consumer has the power to choose what products they want. Don‚Äôt like these features? Complaining like a whiny bitch then ordering it on amazon like a complete dunce is only making the problem WORSE. You really think EA holding the most disliked comment on Reddit really made them learn their lesson? No because they‚Äôre made bank on that game and will continue to do the same with the games in the coming future.[deleted]I like playing a female in games smaller hit box .Well that's just every game you've chosen to purchase then. Female leads have increased over the years but it is not even close to 50/50 \s\shttps://www.statista.com/statistics/871912/character-gender-share-video-games/Wew hot take. Guess what; those of us on the right are also unhappy with gross wanton greed ruining games. Feminism and diversity influencing games is not all we think about but interesting to see that broad generalization in your perception.Yet you vote for politicians that want to deregulate everything and allow unbridled capitalism. This is exactly what happens when your precious ""free"" market decides everything[deleted]Capitalism gave rise to video games in the first place. This is a zero sum game argument that doesn't apply.There's only one reality. Saying that just because a system produced something you like means the system shouldn't be taken away is limiting. Because we don't actually know if any other system could've brought about video games. Could a system of communism see the creation of video games? Could anarcho communism? I'm pretty sure they could have given time but we can't exactly test that so it's a debate that shoots itself in the foot before we even begin.\s\sSo we should instead focus on fixing current issues by either changing or overhauling the system that yes created these games but is also the reason for their slow destruction in the eyes of the consumer.[The first video was made with funding from the public through the government.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two) Also what is probably the most popular game of all time (Tetris) was made by communists in the USSR. In addition to all that there are many fantastic games that were made with no profit motive in mind.\s\sWhy do you think everything has to be done for profit? That's just not true.Also shows well some flaws of capitalism. Just look at  mobile gaming if you want to see the flaws even more obviously.Hmmm yep totally explains why the indie boom never happened and the continued decline of games that are clearly meant to be cash machines. That's exactly why there was zero backlash for the original state of Battlefield 2 and its sales weren't hurt at all. Market responses to abuse absolutely never happen.You're supposed to put /s for sarcasm /s. ""Decline of Gaming"" is an exaggeration but there is a reason for the back lash against Battlefield 2 and Star Wars Battlefront 2 and a a dozen other ""AAA"" titles that had various greedy features. Big corporations being greedy isn't the entirety of gaming right now but it still exists. Don't respond to unintentional hyperbole with sarcastic hyperbole.[deleted]I think the issue is  pretending ""gamers"" is a cultural group with cohesive opinions. But yes game chat is toxic and full of impressionable little shitlords across the board.Well although I'm quite conservative on social issues I'm quite far left on the economy and business side of things.So a nationalist... and a socialist... A national socialist....So confused right now. You want govt healthcare but not abortions? You want food stamps for poor but not marriage equality? You dont belive in climate change but believe in public funded research which tells us that climate change is true??Elaborate because alt-right means nazi and if you‚Äôre openly labeling yourself as that...yikesThis is a new one ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fiscally liberal but domestically conservative‚Äù two extremes lmao\s\sAlso the fuck does alt-right mean on social issues? You‚Äôre wanting strict drug sentencing militarized police for-profit prisons and abortion criminalized?I‚Äôm guessing you mean libertarian/conservative? It‚Äôs weird to label your self that but more weird how people are reacting to it. As if they have a say or power over you if that‚Äôs really how to feel.""Almost alt right on social issues"" please elaborateIt isn't the same. A lot of feminism isn't based on science in fact they tend to reject evolution and psychology in favor of the Patriarchy hypothesis. See getting equal rights which I support as a progressive isn't the same as forced diversity. It is actually another facet of capitalism that doesn't care. All companies have to do is put the ""correct"" messaging in about diversity like they are meeting some quota then they can act like they are doing good. So they can say look at our diversity aren't white males evil and dumb give me all your money.\s\sThat is what many people don't understand corporate feminism is just another attempt to camouflage capitalism. Meanwhile the most radical forms of feminism which are akin to a religion are seeping into nerd culture not organically but with blatant proselytizing.  \s\sNow you might be thinking that is ridiculous feminism isn't a religion and that would be true for the moderates but not so for the most vocal. As an atheist that has argued with creationists on public streets before I can tell you many feminists have the same anti-science self-centered sanctimonious emotional attitude. They use emotional manipulation fallacious arguments and sometimes alternative facts. It even goes far that you are not allowed to make any criticisms as a man because ALL argumentation coming from a man is ""mansplaining"".\s\sWhat my fellow progressives need to understand real diversity is embracing the *differences* in people allowing them to be who they want and creating a symbiosis that allows for something greater than the sum of its parts.Not a biased view on feminism at all.please don‚Äôt call yourself a progressive. you are parroting explicitly right-wing talking points like the oppression of the white maleNot that i really lean right that much but i definitely believe in capitalism that hot take of his and the circlejerk around it is a gross oversimplification and generalization. I have a hard time putting my thoughts into words at 5:50AM but i guess what i would like to point out is why does he or this subreddit or the other subreddits that xposted this think that only one of those things is ""ruining"" games?This is not exactly a galaxy brained take.\s\sGamers were lost to the right because of culture war. Feminists came in told gamers they sucked for being male and their games were sexist and demanded that gamers change their own values and culture to be ""inclusive"" to man-hating harridans and at the same time they entryism-ed gaming companies and gaming forums and gaming conventions and basically everything so that male gamers couldn't really go anywhere or do anything without having to follow new rules and accept new culture basically being forced on them.\s\sAll the right had to do was say ""yeah fuck that shit"" which is what the right has been saying all along to the SJWs _even though the SJWs called them racist and sexist_ (which totally shamed everyone else into compliance). The SJWs made right culture the only safe space left for gamers who didn't want to be scorned censored and told how and what to think.\s\sThis is what Gamergate was REALLY about at its heart although few of the GGers will say so.\s\sSo there you go. The actual left gets buttfucked yet again by idpol - and most ""progressives"" were too stupid and brainwashed to understand what they were doing.> This is what Gamergate was REALLY about at its heart although few of the GGers will say so.\s> \s> \s\sGamergate was about corrupt gaming journalists being lazy and corrupt.  Then they tried to use sexism as a shield from criticism.Listing off a bunch of right wing anti-SJW talking points and having the absolute cajones to talk about the ‚Äúactual left‚Äù as if you someone who clearly has no understanding of intersectionality gets to be the arbiter of leftist ideology.I'd say it was more a misinterpretation of what the feminists were saying next to none of them were actually man haters. Most just pointed out the problems of sexism in the gaming community  however the right capitalized on that as many of the gamers reactions were negative as they didn't see any problems with sexism in the industry. Seeing as they saw nothing wrong and felt attacked they then attached themselves to the right's feminist hating message. I can understand not liking idpol or modern progressives but this take isn't a great reason to dislike either. And as a whole your post kinda comes off as right wing propaganda portraying the feminists and ""sjws"" in the exact same way a right winger would cut out the last part and you can barely find a difference.I don't think anyone has said that diversity is ruining video games but the feminists were harping on about it at one point.  The fake as fuck internet feminists anyways.You didn't hear that *from the feminists* did you though?\s\sYou probably heard it through the lens of some Youtube talking head like Sargon or Bearing or one of those other guys right? They purposefully misrepresented the arguments of feminists to portray them as harpies making stupid points. They were actually just trying to put a spotlight on the prevalence (or lack thereof) of representation in video games. Ad hominem and bad faith arguments by that group of Youtubers misconstrued  the feminiest argument and turned it into an ""us vs. them"" scenario where self-identified gamers were meant to feel like they were being oppressed when there was no such situation. Most folks watched those channels bought into those arguments and then went on harping about ""the feminists are ruining games!1!!"" to all their buddies without ever stopping to question the validity of the arguments they were spoon-fed.> I don't think anyone has said that diversity was ruining video games.\s\sIncorrect Chief. I seem to remember when battlefield v released with female soldiers nobody said anything until right wingers whined and fell on the floor in hilariously dramatic baby tantrum fashion tried to play it off and say it was about ""historical accuracy"" (lol) when they never once pointed out a single piece of historical inaccuracy in any previous battlefield game before. Soon as female characters were a thing though all of a sudden it was a massive problem and they suddenly and conveniently cared *so* much about historical accuracy. Such blatantly obvious feigned outrage snowflake-ism from those that call everyone else snowflakes. I saw this all so clear as day and I'm not even a feminist. It was just completely transparent bs and everyone knew it.I game I don‚Äôt know anyone who thinks diversity has ruined gaming lol. We just play games to chill and have fun. And I‚Äôm not brave enough for politics anywaysCalling gamers racist and sexist for enjoying their games was the first wrong step. Then trying to screw with their enjoyment by forcing their agendas into videogames where noone wanted them. I‚Äòm a gamer and I‚Äòve voted the leftest party with chances to do something every single time I had the opportunity to cast a vote - but I am more and more turned off by the left when they care about ‚Äûissues‚Äú like the wagegap or some other odd statistic about men ‚Äûunfairly‚Äú achieving more than women when things like mandatory military service (only for men ofc) are still a thing in my home country. Video games used to be a place to escape politics and such but now I have to be bombarded by it from all sides because people wouldn‚Äòt let big gaming companies be if they didn‚Äòt add some random feminist bullshit into them.  \sYou know if you want diverse games and if you want this or that in a game go ahead and fucking make it. Literally anyone can publish games and if your feminist ideas are so crucial for having a good experience then people would buy that shit as well. But leave my Peach alone let my Ahri have huge knockers and at least pretend that not every female character has to be some emancipated superwoman whos not afraid of anything.I've been gaming for 25 years. It's not an identity for me it's not a lifestyle or even my favorite hobby. It's just something I like to do. The inclusion of well rounded characters of both the male and female variety for me has less to do with feminism and more to do with me genuinely wanting the gaming scene to grow the fuck up. To tell better stories and justify calling itself art. That's it. I'm tired of moody little sacks of teenage hormones dictating the market because all the want is bouncy anime titties and played out tropes.All things are open to criticism. The simple fact of the matter is that most GaMeRs are sheltered spoiled shut ins who have very misogynistic views. They have been lulled into a false sense of security from literally NEVER having their media critically analyzed so when the time finally came to criticize blatant sexist shit they lost their marbles.  \sPolitics is everywhere in videogames -- it never has been absent. I don't know how you can ""escape from politics"" in games that literally have you shooting terrorists and exploring dystopian libertarian hellscapes.And not every female character has to be a vapid and obsequious sex object. Honestly there's a lot of projection going on here. Maybe there's a reason this post triggered you.>I‚Äòm a gamer and I‚Äòve voted the leftest party\s\sLol. You sound like a Russian troll. No one calls it the leftist party. Especially people who actually vote.Lmao because there are of course absolutely NO female gamers who would like to also have someone they can identify with to play as.All they are is bitter that they can't get laid so they take their anger out on the world. \s\sIf they would get off their fat asses and develop some social skills and get their dicks wet  maybe they wouldn't be so fucking angry about diversity and women \s\sü§î[deleted]You have 250+ reddit posts/comments in the last week and yet you tell people to get out of the basement. Your activity heatmap looks like game of tetris.It's clear you're not a gamer and have no knowledge of how the community works. You can be a gamer AND get a GF. Majority of adult gamers have GFs or wives too. It is not a requirement simply getting laid and being single is fine too. Fucking illiterate morons like you are why gamers don't want to socialize outside of their communities. Why would we waste our time talking to toxic imbeciles like you? Just give me a reason what's so special about you for me to go out of my way just to talk to you? We would rather be having fun - alone or with friends. \s\sThink with your fucking brain for once instead of relying on the bullshit brainwashing media. Media and journalists pick on gaming because it's one of the largest entertainment industries. It doesn't take much brainpower to realize not everyone is the same.The guy who made this post is fucking delusional how can you compartmentalise people based on their distaste for having a political agenda in their games.Every piece of art is political so jot that down. \s\sAs society evolves and grows so should the things we consume (tv books movies). We need to applaud the smart integration of these political ideas in videogames (like Spec Ops: The Line) because it means that the artist really put their own emotions into the work. \s\sThe Witcher a franchise adored by the gaming community is a VERY political game - tackling issues like the concentration of power religious extremism twisting moral principles conflicts of race and the inequality of men and women. The exploration of these concepts is what made the story so compelling and interesting - because we were able to mirror our world to it. But no one screamed then to ""MaKe It LeSs PoLiTiCaL""\s\sIt's because the word political has been misused - these games aren't political they're commentary on societal dynamics and shortcomings. They're exploration of our current climate and the limits of our morality. Yet all of these ideas are easily dismissed under the banner of it being ""political""\s\sGames shouldn't be ""less political"" - we need more of it it's unfortunately just very poorly done in AAA titles because the publisher isn't there to talk about actual issues it's there to empty your wallet with whatever service level message it can tout to make you feel good.They put the social politics into gaming to attract their target demographic. Big gaming doesn't have an agenda aside from making money.You‚Äôre delusional for believing the guy was compartmentalizing instead of using an example of the influential fringe right and omitting the larger body of opinions to make a point.[deleted]Games with loot boxes and microtransactions drive greater profits than games without. A lootboxed game with 40 players probably makes more than a non-lootboxed game with 100 players.  Individuals disliking these practices do not overrule the people that concede to them. Markets are literally made up of the people so to say ""this is on you not the market"" is silly. \s\sCapitalism is when generation of capital trumps all. The idea of lootboxes did not come from the drive to make games more fun nor did any of the other developments OP described. It's fair to blame capitalism for games being designed to maximize profit rather than to be more fun.\s\sAlso don't call it a monopoly if you don't see a monopoly. Call it a duopoly or a cartel. They all make games with the same ethos at the same prices with the same smarmy ways to extract maximum profit.If you have an econ degree you should really know what a collective action problem is.Econ major: Is our economic policy out of touch with human behavior? No it's the people who are out of touch with economic theory.[deleted]Only ‚Äúmonopolistic regime‚Äù I can think of is EA notably with the NHL series. EA also abuses micro transactions and all the other bullshit to no end but its not entirely capitalism‚Äôs fault. As stated if there‚Äôs a market for it it‚Äôll be there. \s\sI don‚Äôt like paying $60 to start up an Ultimate Team so i don‚Äôt. It really is that simple. \s\sOn that note 2K you got any more of those NHL games?Dont even try to make them think it is always other's people fault. It's easier that way.Everything OP said is on the consumers. However I do think problems like overworked and underpaid developers needs to be addressed more.Well said.That's because they are racist af. Look at the reaction from witcher gamers to an actress with Indian ancestry playing the lead on the netflix show.Wanting a faithful casting isn't racistThe only reason why games are getting better over the years is because of capitalism. Competition fuels each game to look better feel better play better and grow better than the last. If not they get panned by the public and everyone flocks to the next best thing. This is an odd take.You know competition and innovation is not a trademark of capitalism.Except its not innovation of the entertainment value that happens. Its innovation of how much money they can charge for the product usually at the cost of entertainment.Communist loser. All that's wrong with capitalism is shown in any industry. All that's right about capitalism is very visible in the gaming industry in particular. Indiedevs and kickstarters are as prominent as ever. If this market were communist I wouldn't be this ballsdeep in the industry as I am. I'd probably be moving to another profession that would actually reward performancedid you just seriously put crowdfunding as a posterchild of capitalism? thats just hilarious.We wouldn't have all these cool games if it weren't for capitalismWhy am I considered right wing if I dont like diversity quotas but not left wing when I don't like micro-transactions and pay to win.There are no diversity quotas. Why can't minority characters in media just simply exist?\s\sI hear this line of thought often. Usually in the form of something like ""I got nothing against so and so group but it's obvious they are just forced in for the sake of diversity.""\s\sIf you can't fathom the idea of minority characters just simply existing in media without perceiving a 'diversity quota' then it really sounds like you do have something against them.Feminism and etc doesnt destroy games but squeezing your agenda in a neutral fanbase does!\s\sBattlefield 5 for example did just that. In the trailer alone you though it's Fortnite from the looks of it not connected to any real life events.\s\shttps://youtu.be/-Iu0pvZP-dM\sThis song russian female snipers a story of diffrent heroic people (50% women if you want) and boom all would be good.\s\sIt's just things like the Game controversy in 2013/15 with the Gamer Gate and how sexist games are apparently when we voiced that thats bs.\s""Women have so little armour and so huge attributes!""\s\sYes but all men look like hulk!\s\sEdit: Meant the WW2 BFI'm assuming you mean Battlefield 5? I don't really see how you could say that about Battlefield 1 as its often cited as an example of how Battlefield 5 could have been done correctly.Battlefield 5 has been a huge shitshow from day 1 and deservingly so \s\sFirst we had a (imo) horrible launch trailer. Yes it did contain a woman which was a huge problem for some. What I found most disappointing about the trailer was the complete lack of any WW2 atmosphere. It honestly felt like it was directed by Michael Bay and contained a clusterfuck of wacky PUBG-like cosmetics. \s\sThen one of the lead devs lost his cool and went on the offensive against the players that didn‚Äôt want women in the game by calling them uneducated and telling them that he didn‚Äôt care whether or not they would buy the game. \sAnd that went about as well as you would expect. \s\sNow that the game is out it‚Äôs obvious that it was rushed through development as it‚Äôs riddled with bugs and has an awful netcode poorly designed maps heavy stuttering poor visibility rampant cheating (which EA/DICE ignores) etc.\s\sHell many bugs have introduced via patches.\sI can mention a few ‚Äúfan favourites‚Äù like invisible soldiers unable to unlock new stuff as you level up never ending plane engine noise and not earning any ingame currency. \s\s\sAnd that‚Äôs just some of the issues with BF5. \sSo despite some players attitudes towards women the game would never have succeeded.Yeah it all went down hil in 07 when Jade Raymond the producer of Assassin's Creed was portrayed covered dripping in cum after sucking off gamers in a webcomic on Something Awful forums.\s\sI was never able to comfortably identify as a gamer after that.\s\sI'm happy to see Gen Z growing up in a virtual landscape that is post peak misogony.\s\s[comic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0Z8CBFIMAAscWT.jpg) (NSFW)\s\sJust to add extra shame to this Something Awful thought they were defending something by laughing at Ubisoft's C&D.The reality is that every police officer violates their oath to defend the constitution by enforcing illegal and u constitutional drug laws. The job of the police isn‚Äôt to keep people safe it‚Äôs to Harass poor people and find drugs so they can fill prisons to profit wealthy people.You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs literally *illegal* for drug laws to exist at the federal level.

I think maybe on the one hand cops should be paid way more money than they're paid now however I think the standards for who they hire show be raised significantly. Just like how doctors or lawyers need years of specialized schooling to even start practicing maybe police officers should be required to have a degree or obtain a license that actually requires a lot of education to recieve. Public servants in general are grossly underpaid like teachers EMS firefighters etc.\s\sNo more dumbass cops that just barely graduated high school. But also pay them a better salary that will attract better candidates.No - don't let them off the hook that easily! Maintaining your integrity has a cost in all walks of life. If anything cops should be held to a higher standard since we've given them the power of life & death.Look at how much good they did before they were pushed out.Please keep in mind that these are cherry picked examples from 6 cases you can't extrapolate every different police department's way of doing things.In what police department would it be okay to fire someone for reporting rape?Mmm boots taste goodThe United States can't afford this. We've got much bigger priorities like maintaining mercenary armies and death squads in every corner of the globe. Especially since in this next decade China is going to eat our lunch. China's going to end up with more advanced post-graduates than the entire US population. More and more key intellectual property will be Chinese. And yet the US will continue to accuse the Chinese of ""theft"" despite the fact that half of what the NSA does is pure industrial espionage no different from China or basically any other state.

It will save working class families thousands of dollars and it will prevent tens of thousands of Americans from dying each year.

This chapter compares the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of millennials with those of earlier generations and compares their income saving and consumption expenditures.  Relative to members of earlier generations millennials are more racially diverse more educated and more likely to have deferred marriage; these comparisons are continuations of longer-run trends in the population.  Millennials are less well off than members of earlier generations when they were young with lower earnings fewer assets and less wealth.  For debt millennials hold levels similar to those of Generation X and more than those of the baby boomers.  Conditional on their age and other factors millennials do not appear to have preferences for consumption that differ significantly from those of earlier generations.   Who made them poor?Boomers. They seem to have found a way to suck the oxygen out of the system at every step of their way through the aging population demographic.

Obviously I'm speaking in generalities and the exact time culture religion geography play role in how many economic rights and power a woman could obtain.\s\sTossing out the bible the leading text in education and influence forced the capitalist barons to find ways to open women to economic exploitation.

Fuck that.Nobody else can ~~profit~~ steal profitsThis happens with many things. You can't sell anything without license i guess. Which is really stupid but true. Literally no one complains you are not saving anybody you are just making things worse.I don't know about ILLEGAL except in Singapore but gum is a big problem in schools.  The kids don't have the respect to take care of their schools.  We could learn a lot from the Japanese whose kids help cook serve meals and then clean their schools.   Sticking gum under a desk won't happen there.    \s\s\sThis kid is having to be a grownup far too early.They don‚Äôt pay taxes on the profits. IRS is probably salivating at stealing some of that money because for the last 50 years all we‚Äôve done is spent money on meaningless wars unconstitutional bureaucracies and entitlement programs. They need to pay for them somehow and the only 2 ways to get that money is print it and steal it through inflation (effectively a tax on everyone) or by taxing people and stealing it from a select group. Either way they are stealing the way all governments do.It may just be a school policy of no gum that they had their enforcer try to assist in enforcing. Our no gum policy was due to the fact gum was being stuck EVERYWHERE. Like it was disgusting. Go sit down gum on your seat. Slide back too far in your seat with long hair gum in your hair.They're doing it for a joke. I think. I can't really speak for other SROs but this seems like something my school's SROs would have done for a laugh.You send your kid with $2 to school to buy lunch.  They spend it on a pack of oreos instead.I have illegal gum come and take itCop trophy shots are cringe enough when they have actual contraband. How did anyone think a candy bust happy snap was a good idea?Maybe they were doing it ironically but that would only make them tone deaf in addition to evil.I got caught selling candy in Florida when I was in junior high. My buddies dad worked for Lance iirc so I got my supply wholesale and could sell it for the same price as the store. I would sell out everyday before lunch then ditch the rest of the day to spend my winnings. \sOne day I was counting my $ at my locker and was accosted by school security. ‚ÄúWhere are the drugs‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have any candy left to prove that I was slinging candy not drugs. (The profit margins where better on the candy or I would have been selling weed) \sThey simple would not believe that I made a stack of cash(probably 300$s in 90s dollars) \sEventually my parents got involved and proved my ‚Äúinnocence‚Äù?They didn‚Äôt confiscate my $ but kept an eye on me and wouldn‚Äôt let me sell candy anymore. \sSo I started selling drugs(weed)  off of school property. \sI shared my story to say that this student is 100% a drug dealer now.I mean listen - *I get it.* You don't want kids chewing gum sticking it under tables getting it in peoples' hair - *High schoolers are little assholes*. Fine whatever. Take the gum and candy ***but give the kid the money back***. Don't kill that spirit of entrepreneurship for the youth. \s\s*Props to the woman Autumn for doing what she needed to do and helping her mother.* It's so vital that we lower the State-created barriers and allow as many people as possible to engage with the Free Market.Stealing is not a job. Property rights are important.When I was in 5th grade I would make pencil drawings. From my house I would walk  miles To a business who would make copies for me put them in my backpack and sell them at school. A student told the teacher I was creating  problems selling my drawings. The student previously bought one from me to show the teacher as evidence. I was then brought into the hallway and yell at. ""You're disrupting the class""  She said and ripped my drawings In half.\s I was in tears....\s I wept not because my drawings were destroyed.\s I cried because I did not understand.\s I thought the school system was created So that its       students would be successful.\s I was an entrepreneur At a very early age.\s The actions of people in power Like these ones leaves  children very jaded.\s And unmotivated.\s  The public school system is designed to make you compliant and uncreative. Make you into a worker with no ideas and does what They are told.That was your libertarian origin story.Thats the intent but I hope you still did drawings sounds like you were into it. üëçüèª> I thought the school system was created So that its students would be successful \s\sIt was created for indoctrination purposes and to provide subsidised childcare but mainly for indoctrination.In middle school I started to buy 12 packs of Coke for 3 dollars and sell them for 75 cents a piece out of my locker in between classes. Did this from 6th grade all the way thru 9th until I got my first job. By 8th grade I was selling drinks to teacher who didn't want to pay the 1.50 at the vending machines. At peak I went thru 7 or 8 cases a week. Ended up saving a lot of it and had close to 6 grand in my savings by the summer between freshman and sophomore years.Fuck this. I did this in grade school and no one gave a shit.We sold playboys in jr high how the fuck are these guys gonna tell kids they can‚Äôt sell gum??When I was in high school you could trade a case of beer or 8th of weed for a blowjob\s\sThat was only like 10 years agoTheft\s\sStop focusing on this and start hunting down actual criminals*Who has time to stop gangbangers and child molesters?* I wouldn't want my kid to get their hands on some ***HARDCORE OREOS***!!You assume the police brave enough to confront actual criminalsBut that‚Äôs hard workWhat absolute heroes #BackTheBlueMan I can‚Äôt believe the police thought this would give them good press what a bunch of idiotsI have an interesting idea that could reduce bullyish behaviour from cops. A couple of ideas really. Firstly is that when a cop is sued the settlement comes from their own pocket and if they can't pay then it goes to asset seizure and after that it comes from police pensions. Secondly these people need to be civil \*servants\* again. They need to be humble and accountable. I think that they should be limited to a 20 or 30 year term and at the end they should be put on trial and give an account of their job. A jury can then decide if the cop has served and protected well or if not the jury is allowed to dispense such punishments as seizure of all of that cop's money or their life. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sThanks for protecting me from chewing gum fuckhead.My son got kicked out of his private high school for selling beer\s\sI didn't realize until now the school was evil for taking this approach\s\sBecause I wasn't as enlightened as I am now from this thread I didn't attack the school's (rather obvious) decision.\s\sI thought then as I do now that he has awesome business chops if a kid who's too young to buy beer can figure out how to sell itSome kids in the high school adjacent to mine registered a business and had alcohol shipped by the pallet because they didn't want to risk getting caught trying to buy witbout ID.\s\sTo this day my head spins at how brilliant that was.Fuck these cops. And the ones that took Autumn‚Äôs money too. These aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbusts‚Äù this is robbery. A bust that the public feels good about is one that the police are making the world safe I.e human trafficking heavy drug violent gang busts. But those don‚Äôt happen because they are too busy feeding into stealing kids candy and money bullshit while not wanting to take the risks on the ones that actually matter. \s\sI‚Äôm not for defunding the police mainly because I know they will just use more civil forfeiture and traffic  tickets to get funding.Look at those pieces of shit. So proud. So please with themselves.Damn kids selling candy without official school sanction! Where are they gonna get the funding for the school boards Christmas bonus huh? \s\sThis is dumb as fuck. Stupid ass school employees are such a waste of tax payer moneyFuck the policeI would make the TFS reference ""not now Ice Cube"" but honestly it's the perfect time\s\sFuck da police""delete this"" is a reddited thing to say.\s\sCensorship is reddited. I want people to see this disgusting shit.it was ironic ""delete this"" is slang for this is embarrassingCartels and violent street gangs watching this Like :/\s\sPolice really are The bullies. Preying on The weakI worked at a company that had 5 or 6 vending machines. A few of the girls sold snacks and soda on the side. As soon as the vending machine company found out they threatened to pull all of their vending machines. The girls got written up for it and had to stop selling their stuff.\s\sIt was fucking bullshit.‚ÄúWe need to ensure our children don‚Äôt become successful entrepreneurs!‚ÄùAnd then there was me in elementary school running a yugioh card cartelReminds me of when my old middle school banned Mexican candy cuz people were making like 50-100 dollars of profit a day it was crazyAs a past gum dealer i think its absolutely absurd how hard teachers would crack down on it. I feel like as capitalist country we should be encouraging kids to enterprise and learn business skills rather then literally punishing them for trying.Literal real crimes are going on but they need to victimize a high schooler and basically teach her capitalism is illegal. She could have become an entrepreneur but after this experience I think it'll crush some of that dream.Fuck the policeThat really is a waste of taxpayer money to torture young people.I sold Jolt caffeine gum by the piece to 7th graders when I was in high school. Nothing funnier than seeing those kids mawing on 4 pieces each heading back inside knowing what hell the afternoon teachers were gonna go through.\s\sDoubled my money per pack tooDamn! I felt like a kingpin making $10/wk back in HS in the 80sThey taught the most valuable lesson a school could ever teach. Government is shit public school is definitely shit and people who police you for things they don't like are shit.Oh man not the gum and oreos!Hahahaha! Wow‚Ä¶this is interesting‚Ä¶why would they crack down on gum trades at school?!So much for free tradeJazz hand photo aswell. SmhThey should be embarrassed and ashamed Of themselves.The system pushes us into destitution and then punishes us for tying to survive.Only the government I allowed to sell over priced snacks in school.Gum rights should not be infringed we're not SingaporeEvery school had that one kidhow can those idiots even smile?Honestly ""Libertarians"" these days are so are off the rails that I had to check the comments to  see which side this sub would fall on.Under the public school system's planned economy you are limited to some sort of whole-grain hardtack or warm bottled water at exorbitant prices. Any attempt to provide an alternative to the state's planned economy is seen as nothing short of revolutionary and the state enforces its socialized snack system with an iron fist. School Vending machines are genuinely one of the most egregious attempts by the state to control the markets.War on snacks. Just say no to snacks. Orbit gum is the gateway snack. You don't know what they put in those Oreos... Well the last one may be true.Two months bills = $400? Daaaamn that‚Äôs cake.you want to know what turns honest people into criminals...Spoiler alert shit like this doesn't make us stop doing it it just makes us more careful about not getting caught.Fucking pigsHow does that make you feel Rich Brian?I‚Äôm confused by what actually happened in the original tweetI despise the government indoctrination camp systemI read this as ‚Äúillegal gun trade‚Äù and was like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt really argue with stopping guns from being traded at school‚Äù and then I realized they busted the candy man. WTF. My school‚Äôs candy man got caught and suspended from school and we were all upset about it because he was a good dude and we all got the vibe his family needed the extra money and didn‚Äôt mind buying from him instead of the vending machine but as far as I know the police never got involved.21 Savage Jump Street\s\sYo you got that Ice?\s\sDentyne or Polar?\s\sIcebreaker‚Äôs Mothafucka! Up against the wall!What happened to the money..?You will lower your expectations and you will like it.No no... I mean you will live with nothing and lower your expectations from there and beg for more nothingnessNever store the cash with the merch. That's rule one.So I got my start when I spent 9th grade in Florida when my dad was stationed there right after my parent‚Äôs divorce. 9th grade there was still Jr High and had kids from 6th to 9th grade. Cinnamon toothpicks were all the rage at the beginning of the year but then they were banned at school. They went so far as to ‚Äúalert‚Äù the stores near the school not to sell them to kids. I bought my own cinnamon extract and started my own operation. My cinnamon toothpicks were much more potent and I charged a cool 25 cents for two. I made enough to fund my comic book habit. \s\sWhen I returned to Vegas at the end of the year I saw a lot of school clubs were selling candy to raise money. Nobody was asking too many questions. At the same time Smart & Final a whole sale store was still members only and my mom had access. Nerds candy was brand new and if I bought a case they were 17 cents a box. I sold them at school for 50 cents. I was riding high cinnamon roll for breakfast every day hot lunch and my comic collection grew. Times were good and ‚Äúthe man‚Äù never caught me.Okay what the fuck? The resource officers in my high school would be buying that shit off the students cause they're fucking awesome. This shit pisses me off.This is why people stopped respecting police bit by bitWow. Shitbags. Glad we have cops to stop things like gum sales in our schools‚Ä¶.Jesus when my friend started selling kool-aid at school the school just told him to stop they didn't take shitAgain this is all cops in schools are meant to do now bully minority and poor children. If there‚Äôs an actual active shooter though? They are magically nowhere to be found and kids are left to play hero or be executed. But sure let‚Äôs pretend this is our tax dollars hard at work busting kids for selling candy and gum. Fucking disgusting.Does anyone know where this is?\s\sI'm interested to know where there is so little crime the police have time to do shit like this.made a lemonade stand with a good friend of mine when I was 12 in the local park the lemonade was transparently made right there by mixing sealed bottled water lemons and sugar\s\ssome old senile piece of shit called the cops on us because the lemonade ""contained suspicious substances"" cops came confirmed the lemonde was safe but literally confiscated our stand kicked us home took our 100$ we made and wanted to give us a fine too but I gave them a fake name and the fine never came through reason was and I quote ""we weren't a registered enterprise paying taxes""\s\swoohoo promoting entrepreneurshipMeanwhile illegals selling meth on your local corners and the police ""don't have enough police power to deal with them""Look at that man posing like he killed all of Al-Qaida.The school cafeteria sells that stuff. They can‚Äôt allow a common student to undercut their hustle.  \s\sCops aren‚Äôt there to serve and protect you. They serve and protect the powers that be.Reminds me of when our underfunded JROTC program started up a black market selling snacks and ramen noodles for lower prices than the (pretty terrible) school lunches. Got tons of funds for supplies and were able to do a couple of pizza parties and events before we got too successful to go unnoticed and someone finally ratted us out. The school admins shut us down because they wouldn‚Äôt allow even a school-related program to make any kind of money without giving more than half the profit to them. The idea didn‚Äôt die and from time to time they still sold stuff to the cadets for short periods until we could offload all our stock but the big money was in selling to the general population so there wasn‚Äôt much point in continuing and risking some kind of bureaucratic battle over it.\s\s\sThe worst part of this nonsense is that I‚Äôm 100% positive that there are illegal drugs being sold on that campus (I mean there definitely were on every high school campus I ever saw) but instead of trying to find that stuff they‚Äôre celebrating over shutting down someone‚Äôs would-be business and stamping out both hope for the future and the entrepreneurial spirit of countless young Americans all over the country.Yall just robbed some kidwithout government who would help the poor who would tax the poor's money and then steal their products.She was probably learning more about arithmetic bookkeeping and business modeling than any public school would ever teach herPigsMy little brother got expelled for giving a Rx strength Motrin to a classmate.\s\sThe way the police and school officials taking it ""super cereal"" was laughable. It's a few 100mg more than store bought but hey its a RX.\s\sSeeing what's happening in this pic happen to my own kid or brother would make me want to punch the gleeful cops versus just laughing at them with worrying about the epidemic of Rx Motrin.\s\sHighschoolers are too young for a headache that requires 200mg more Motrin than a single Motrin!This is fucking ignorant.I'm pretty sure these laws were meant to be used to take away proceeds to serious crime not someone trading without a license. Especially children trading without a license.Stealing is stealing. If it's a penny or a million dollars stealing is a crime.  If it's not yours what entitles you to take whatever you want? That's the problem with society in the US...such an entitled mind set.Did she steal it ?Defund the police.When I was in high school we had guys who would steal an assload of full size candy bars from stores and then sell them for 1$ each at school. \s\sLaw enforcement exists to prevent THAT and shouldn't be used as a tool to hurt small business. \s\s_just moderate libertarian things_Where is she living that all her bill are only $200 a month?  And why doesn't her mom work?She's probably living 20-25 years ago where that memory is from when she was a kid and she was *helping her mom make ends meet* not *being the breadwinner*First off do we know if this is actually true? And if so what‚Äôs the full context? Because I‚Äôm somewhat doubtful the police even just an SRO would confiscate the gun and money from a student just becausePersonally I'm dubious.  If you're walking around with $400 in cash from selling snacks at school you're either raking in that much money in a day and making it back shouldn't be too too hard (even if it takes a few days of being more circumspect to do it) or you're completely insane and carrying around multiple days' cash on you like that and being robbed eventually was inevitable.[removed]Good on the kid for having a side hustle but bad on the kid for getting caught.  Gotta be discrete with that shit.What‚Äôs the crime here? She was just doing her own small business and no one was hurt or exploited \s\sIs it because she‚Äôs a student and it counts as ‚Äúchild labor‚ÄùThis is capitalism?It wasn't the sale of the gum that was the problem but the tax evasion.Ah man! These guys just needed a cork gun in the picture.This happens at work too someone starts to compete with the vending machine and someone has a cow.\s\sAlthough the police don't get involved and it remains a private matter.\s\sAlso this happened like 4 years agoThe school runs the bingo in this diocese.We got em goodIf you are a big government democrat and you believe that all the regulations that control private industry and necessary and important than you should applaud this arrest.\s\sIf you believe that licencing fees or safety training or hygene inspections or OSHA or EEOC or any of those things are good you should hate Autumn and the fact that she is not abiding by any of these laws and regulations.\s\sBut you don't because it's a story that allows you to say ""Cops Bad!""<checks notes> is probably the most cringe statement out of RedditCops are my favorite obituaries.""bust"" ah yesJesusThe company lawyers of courseThey‚Äôre really catching the next El Chapo here aren‚Äôt they.

Is there anything that can be done?This is genuinely a meme now. My father always mentions the sylvester stallone movie where he‚Äôs frozen and wakes up in the future. And the law and order have become so absolute that literally every little things is a crime so people have also become like almost rule following bots. And then the villain wakes up and goes on a rampage and no one can deal with him because they have no idea how. So the takeaway is it doesn‚Äôt matter how much crime they put down they‚Äôll make up new ones to keep their jobsApparently their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GphsSro) is now suspended.'What you need is' ... more agorism.Next time someone does this just pretend your giving it away for free. What are they gonna do then?This is stupid as shit but people using this as an excuse to say all cops are bad or whatever is just dumb. We need cops and for the most part they do good ofc there‚Äôs stupid shit like this but it‚Äôs worth it if we get protection from thieves and murderers imoCops don‚Äôt protect you from thieves and murderers. They show up after the fact and write a report and never get back to you. They are too busy harassing law abiding citizens on the road. And they aren‚Äôt obligated to help you at all according to the Supreme Court. They are the enemy of the people.Sure but how is getting your protection from thieves and murderers better than protecting yourself? Or hiring honest people to protect you?\s\sIs it just a ""better the devil you know"" thing?Literally who said that. You're just making shit up.""Delete this"" is the magical phrase that makes me lose all sympathy. Fuck her too.You still have time to delete this stupid ass commentI‚Äôm sure it was all boosted she likely failed to mention that she stole it all in the first place.This must just be an American thing since in Australia everyone sells foodKids use their parents food stamp cards to buy candy and generate actual cash from the sales. Thats the hustle.   \s  \sI dont appreciate it but it's less trashy than my old roommate who would use his food stamps for milk with a 50c deposit on the glass jar come home pour all the milk down the sink and then go buy beer with his 2 bucks in deposit money.Assuming all brown people are poor?

The news and social media attacks. Remember when Obama got elected? That came on the heels of 4 years of 24/7 coverage attacking Bush for being a war criminal. Then Obama gets into office doesn‚Äôt change a damn thing wrt Bush‚Äôs empire building even increases drone strikes and civilian casualties in Pakistan and what does the news and social media do?

Wish me luck and see if your city has a SCORE that can help you set up a business.There is a 100% chance this will be used as a cover for racism / sexism / transphobia / ableism since it'll be trained on mostly white cis men like every other facial recognition AIDon't forget ageism. üôÉi most certainly wouldn't pass this test. i hardly pass a normal job interview.It'll basically weed out everyone who isn't a boot licking pro-corporate white cis male extrovert.Machine learning is great for when you really want to make snap judgements based on spurious correlations but it's really inconvenient to have to do it all yourself.Doubt it it‚Äôll leave a clear paper trail for a really fat lawsuit. Amazon caught theirs and killed it so fast.\s\sGarbage in garbage out problem in machine learning can be solved anyways I doubt companies will risk itLike that episode of Better off Ted where they got cameras that opened doors and stuff but only worked for white people.[removed]I can't believe they even want people to do performative emotionality in job interviews.‚ÄúEye contact‚Äù\s\sWhat the fuck? If there‚Äôs no eyes to make contact with how can you judge that? Talking to a camera is **not** the same as talking to an actual person. \s\sOf all the things that‚Äôs fucked the worst is that this will inevitably prefer sociopaths people who can fake charm and empathy even without actually feeling it (for which you need another human being).I hate this. I recently applied for a job at a hospital and they wanted me to do one of these. I asked if I could schedule a phone interview instead. They were like no our current manager requires this. To me they're saying they want me to waste my time talking to an AI and they won't even talk to me. It's disrespectful. I replied that I wouldn't do the ""interview"" as I did not agree with this hiring practice. The poor HR recruiter she seemed to agree lol.GrossSo what about all the millions of things this stupid fucking program won't pick up on that a human could? Fuck who am I kidding. Most people working in corporations may as well be a robot because they have no soul anymore. \s\sThis ad is basically openly telling you they want you to become a robot and act a certain way. IT'S CALLED AN ACT FOR A REASON. You are acting and carrying out a program that normally wouldn't come naturally to you. I get you have to do this to a certain extent in life but the level these companies and society is forcing us to do is completely unnatural. I could go on and on about this topic but I'll stop now for my own sake.So this is why I didn't get that job at Indigo they made me do some stupid fucking AI test. \sI worked so hard on my answers and being as I have social anxiety I'm not good at eye contact. How is talking to a computer even the same as talking to a person anyway? It's so unnatural even extroverts would have issues.What the FUCK? Techbros get the wall.Nopeahh perfect a new tool employers can ignore me with.We are becoming ChinaGreat for psychopaths thoEvil and disgusting. It takes the sickening begging game to a whole new level of awful.I've had 3 interviews via video call or Video mail. I didn't get those jobs. I don't know anyone that wants to work in a warehouse that looks enthused to be anywhere. Also I'm on spectrum and have a hard time with eye contact. So this this is why i still don't have a job...I have cervical dystonia too so my head would likely be crooked jittery as fuck or resting in my hand. Must mean I don't want the job right! *Pass*Yeah I have a similar visible disability and I hate being on video for this reason. At least in person they can see that I can interact well and I don't appear as ""strange.""This is disgustingFully mechanised oppression.Shipt a grocery delivery service uses hirevue for their interviews. I failed my first interview passed on the second.So many big companies are going into algorithm-based decision making because when they're accused of breaking the law (about things like discrimination) they can deny any culpability by saying that the bot did it.I remember reading a psychology book which had a piece about first impressions at job interviews. It concluded that the best way to see how a person performs is to actually have them work for a while instead of basing it on the interview.... I don't have any wordsThe HireVue AI has been terrifying since I first heard about it.  As a former recruiter/HR guy what might well happen is this:\s\s1. Applicant is automatically suggested to apply to a specific role via a career-site algorithm.\s2. Applicant's resume LinkedIn etc. are run through the ATS and processed automatically. They may also be given automated skill testing.\s3. Automated phone interview happens from career site when ATS pings ""interested"". The computer calls the candidate analyzes the responses for keywords pitch tone etc. and responds back with a score.\s4. After a passing score on the phone interview the candidate is given a HireVue video interview.\s5. Upon a passing HireVue grade the ATS pings that the person is to be hired.\s\sNotice that there's not one single human decision in that whole process. You could literally go from application to hired and had no human involvement in the company. It's utterly absurd but I'm afraid of what might happen if somehow the ""AI"" (fancy name for a bunch of iterative algorithms) becomes an AI (self-aware non-biological life form).Sounds like eugenics... \s\scoooool /sNext step is to have every cunty person who thought this was a good tool to implement go before it and base whether they keep their job on whether they can please Skynet.The most important thing someone could have told me as a kid is that the adult world is really all about acting and posturing not authenticity or reality. It's very depressing realizing that I have to become an actor on top of everything else expected of me. I don't have that kind of energy. I just don't. \s\s*Remember back when you were a kid and you thought there were actually people that knew what this thing we call life was really all about? Remember when you thought there really were grown ups? Then all of a sudden one day you become a grown up yourself and the terrifying revelation occurs to you that there really are no grown ups just kids that got old and had kids of their own and no one really knows what the fuck is going on.* - Joe Rogan (the only time I'll ever quote him)""It's entirely possible"" that you'll quote Joe again  ò‚Äø ò\s\sIn all seriousness though yes I dont have the energy anymore.Yup. When I realized that I had to go to a therapist. I was 23 or 24 years old.\s\sThen I realized even she does not have a FUCKING clue what she is doing there. She is just trying to help people to cope with reality but I found out that the real problem is not ourselves but the environment. \s\sSince she can't do anything about it neither do I. I realized I must fight my way into this hell we call society and make my own ground block myself from the shitshow that is the outside world.\s\sThen it strucked me. Everybody is like this everybody is suffering from this. Everybody is trying to make a better world for themselves.\s\sSo the conclusion is Life = Suffering it doesn't matter if we live in a technology advanced society we as humans are bound to suffer when we are born we are marked for suffering. \s\sThere is no escape only no procriation. Stop the cycle. I made the decision to not having kids even being a single son and my parents wanting a grandson alot. It doesn't matter someone have to break the cycle.\s\sWe really should stop plugging people ""out"" of the ""Matrix"" to the real world. Let them be dreams ""live"" in a eternal dream palace without being ever born into this shithole.This is fascism. This is what fascism looks like this is how it behaves. This is fascism.No doing anything for hat looks like 'resistence'.\s\sBecause it's important to appear to approve of Trump so other will follow suit or at least not make it openly known.I want the image of bezos dumping urine on his face to be this sub's bannerSecondedBtw a few years ago Elon Musk [said that oil is ""dead dinosaurs""](https://i.redd.it/o5qo7unic9151.jpg) and there's a russian meme that roughtly translates as ""*as a geologist I'm gonna pee on the face of anyone who thinks that oil is a product of the decomposition of the dinosaurs*""\s\sSo... which billionaire is next?\s\sP.S. [found the tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1061367825724522497)That would make the newsPlease!Let's make this happens please Mods???YesYes. Please!That dead-eyed stare as Bezos pours urine all over himself  is pure gold.Liquid gold‚ÄúCrown for king‚ÄùThey make people turn there phones over before shift?At the moment no but normally yes. You can be fired if you have your phone on you even if it's by accident( alot of the times) gotta' keep it in a locker if you're lucky enough to be assigned one or in your car. You also have to go through security at the end of shift and take off all metal and if you go off they pull you aside scan your badge and wand you. No idea if the scaning your badge means much but some days if it's MET/peak it can take 15-20 mins to get outta' the building lol. then the big walk to your car and mazelike lots to get out. Got hit once and legit almost killed about 2 times. People just speed.Love the triangle shirtwaist company reference on the boards on the lower left panel!This! Triangle Shirtwaist fire was beyond awful. Note also matchstick girls and radium girls for ""screw employee safety"" as well.What does that mean?Take the fucking award my friend.I‚Äôm still not convinced he‚Äôs actually a human.If we deny the humanity of monsterous people like Bezos and Musk we will forget the lesson that *more* people like them could arise given the chance. We need to remember that no matter how heinous their crimes they're still humans. Which means *other humans* are also capable of their crimes.He is. He's just really sick.Pretty sure there was a Cushvlog recently with Matt Christman where he hypothesizes that the elite no longer are since they live in a bubble and are entirely enslaved to manipulating the algorithm.Robert Evans just did a great episode of Behind the Bastards on Bezos. He's basically the same person he was when he was 12. He has by all accounts not evolved as a person since then in his goals in life or his personality. He's a great example of a gifted kid with a rich family being born on 3rd base convinced he hit a triple.Of course hes human. Only humans could be so cruel.They Live...Do they actually make you turn in your phone?You don‚Äôt even get bathroom breaks according to the only one of my friends to ever work there it‚Äôs sad.\s\sThey hire ex-cons and people that can‚Äôt find work elsewhere though so they‚Äôll always have a steady supply.Im on my 3rd week so far this does not seem true i can use the restroom whenever and there are no metal dectors you just walk out. Which is kind of weird considering my state has had extreme security since colombineJust like in schoolThey're all set up as shell company contractors to maximize exploitative behavior. Locally I've heard mostly good things and they pay at LA/NYC rates and I live in Ohio. However since they are ""independent"" contractors it could indeed be literal hell when you clock in. Just depends where you are.A lot of major corporations do this or give you lockers.When I was a seasonal driver at ups if I wanted a bathroom break you would just step into the back of the vehicle that had a sliding door between drivers and the packages and pee in a bottle. I heard rumors of a guy on a rural route shitting in a bag. I was young so I thought it was ‚Äúcool‚Äù. Fuck that shit.I spend a lot of time working rurally in the middle of nowhere so regularly find myself shitting in bushes. I have a portable toilet. 'A camping chair with a hole cut in the middle.'\s\sThen again my boss wouldn't complain if I drove to a supermarket to go to the toilet. The problem is my ass only gives me a two minute warning that an explosive shit is incoming.The image of Bezos water-falling straight piss onto his face is a nice touch thank youHow Bezos is still alive after treating people like trash still amazes mehis security detail must be greatDo they seriously make you turn in your phone?YesThis is incredible. Are there more??ooof the Triangle Shirtwaist reminderWhen i worked in a candy factory as a packer the plan in case of a fire was for us to be lead further into the factory instead of going outside with the other employees. Theoretically the area was supposed to be fireproof  but that doesn't stop a fire inside that area.Depending on the size of the factory number of occupants and distance to the exits this can actually be the right decision.\s\sSkyscraper or large factories for example will do this to evacuate areas strategically. You get the people in the fire and fire adjacent areas out first to avoid clogging up exit routes then others follow if the fire continuesThe idea of turning my phone in before a shift is seriously demeaning what if I have a family emergency or something?>The idea of turning my phone in before a shift is seriously demeaning\s\sPersonal phones are a massive security problem in a warehouse that handles phones. They also create customer privacy issues and destracted employee issues. On top of that you get the usual cargo cult management issues.\s\s>what if I have a family emergency or something?\s\sThey phone the worksite. Its not like your phone has a worthwhile ATEX rating so there are always going to be limits on where you can take it.This is a masterpiece.J.K. Simmons works for Amazon now?How do they MAKE THEM turn in their phones? Like if it was me I‚Äôd be like yeah I leave my phone in the glovebox of my car (and if that didn‚Äôt fly then I‚Äôd just hand them my old iPhone se that no longer works). Meanwhile I‚Äôd have my phone on silent mode stuffed between my legs in my underwear. There‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôd turn in my phone for so many reasons the big ones being emergencies like someone needing an ambulance. I‚Äôve heard some places do pat-downs (which is insane btw) but are they really going to grab your crotch? Probably not. And if they do find your phone in the crotch of your underwear then I guess you‚Äôre in luck bc now you have a sexual harassment/assault claim since your phone was literally in the crotch of your underwear. Seriously tho fuck Amazon. There is no much blood on their hands and it‚Äôs disgusting that they‚Äôre not held accountable ‚Äúbc money‚Äù.Metal detectors will find your phone.Alright Bezos cooling himself off with piss should be shown in real life too. The guy eats iguana which are practically his cousins; you know he has some nasty ass fetishes.Holy shit. Do they really have to turn in their phones before starting work?Bezoz still isnt ceo anymoreDoesnt mean hes not a piece of shit thoBut he is still the face of Amazon.\s\sI doubt most people have ever heard of Andy Jassy.He's Executive officer and majority stock holder. By literal definition he still runs the company. And even if he didn't he would still have enough pull to fix the problem or at least try. Your best case scenario is still him being a shitty person.Bumping ‚úä this is amazingDo they really make you turn in your phone?Baldilocks and his thirst quenchers.  what a visionaryIt's sad but I feel really thankful i dont have kids/debt/college so if/when an employer tells me this kinda shit i can just give em the finger flash my asshole at them then leave and find a new job without immediately worrying about mouths to feed. My heart goes out to all of the employees out there who have little choice but to suffer through this dystopian nightmare. RIPElysiumI worked at FedEx for a bit. They definitely make you turn in your phone it isn't a lie.What's the thing about Bezos and the urine bottles?\s\sI somehow missed that.>triangle  shortwaist tested\sLmaoWell done very amusing too.Let's not forget that Andy Jassy is the CEO of Amazon. He is complicit in continuing these practices and also deserves the meme treatment.Wait do they really have to turn their phones in at the start of a shift? I couldn't imagine going an entire shift without my phone on me!Got to be a terrible place to workWho really cares what it is?It's kinda crazy sad bc he'll be beheaded in under 10 years. Americans have been impoverished. Don't believe me? GO TAKE A DRIVE ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. He'll struggle at the end but quit making up false realities. People have been wanting to kill him a long time ago. This little billionaire fad is a fad. The people are ALWAYS stronger.[deleted]He doesn't get to claim the success of the company and blame the failures on others. Every thing is his fault. Good or bad.Hes literally the big boss. He lets all this shit fly and even encourages it by making max profit the big goal. If he wasnt the main pos he would actually do something about it. But no he doesnt. \s\sReminder; this is HIS company.[You're sort of thinking in the right direction.](https://youtu.be/9UeHv5D1jH4)\s\sBut we can still deal with him as well.Humanity needs to be wiped off the face of the fucking planet. We don't deserve to existSure you first.CNt believe Amazon forces people to work there against their will!DECOY PHONEYep. Much of the time poverty is an inescapable downward spiral which is all the more reason why we need to decouple the ability to lead a decent meaningful life from employment.I have a friend who spends 2 hours of income each day to just park at her job.Good luck getting a job if you're homeless. I had to use a PO box in my teens to apply for jobs.It's the fucking worst. Back when I worked retail I knew a woman who had a 3y/o daughter. She quit because she was capped at 30hrs a week making $10/hr before taxes and daycare was costing her $250/week. It was literally costing money to have that shitty retail job. Fuck this shit man.This reminds me of that story I read somewhere on reddit (it might have been here) about the guy who got fired.... not for anything he did but because a coworker found out he was living in his car and told their boss.   \s\s\sApparently being poor is a fire-able excuse :(Reading this was so stressful and makes me wanna fight that man. Disgusting and inhumane. I can never understand why people lack so much empathy.Piece of shit boot-lickerAnything is in an ‚Äúat will‚Äù state.Wore trainers to work and pretended they were safety shoes as I couldn't afford them untill payday.Merica\s\sLand of the sociopaths.Not disagreeing but if you can't afford gas money and decent clothing you probably shouldn't have children.A lot of people have children when they're well off/comfortable and then fall on hard times. Even if they're poor and get pregnant accidentally many people do not have safe access to abortion or even adoption services. In the case of the latter thousands of children are better off with poor parents than stuck in a foster/adoption system that's clogged and abusive. How about instead of criticizing people and whinging ""aNtInaTaliSm"" we TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO EXIST RIGHT NOW AND NEED HELP. IT'S NOT HARD. Even if everyone stopped having children this second it would take a long time before there were no children in need.It's 2019. It's embarrassing that some countries still have kings and queensAnd that they're so romanticized despite any number of inhumane crimes the family commitsThis is so ridiculous.  Look at them!  Two old people looking freaking bizarre!! Lol.  And people support them in doing this because they decided these people are ‚Äúroyal‚Äù whatever that‚Äôs supposed to mean in these modern times.I remember the news about homeless people living near the palace where the prince Harry had his extravagant wedding. I was like WTF! The royal family could spend millions on a wedding but cannot afford to help the homeless.Buckingham Palace alone is worth some ¬£2 billion.Fuckin crusty cunts I despise these utter utter pointless pieces of shitYet there are still people who defend the monarchy. They're a special type of bootlickers.Fun fact: To ""pull oneself up by one's bootstraps"" used to mean an impossible task as if you try to lift yourself up by pulling on your shoelaces you get nowhere.That is a cool factIve got one for youMortgage literally means ""Death"" ""Pledge""  in old french \sthey are openly mocking peopleI keep saying that what they meant by it was true hundreds of years ago when you could farm your land and be dependent only from it...but now there is no way to magically become rich without needed people or HELP. \s\sIf you're an entrepreneur you need customers and employees or else your idea is nothing. When you are growing up you get free education and healthcare...\s\sThe notion that you alone magically can accomplish something is false.Which is literally where these job creators will get without the people they rely on to do the work.\s\sWe need unions.I'll always appreciate that phrase a whole lot more now ..I am super aware of this phrase and the irony of how people use it these days (kind of like the game monopoly being a consumerist capitalist training exercise considering it's origin) but I just thought to myself I kind of want to actually try that. I have pretty good core strength and I replaced my boot laces with 550 paracord.... I wonder do I have to start from totally flat on my back or what?Im watching our up votes tick up and down by the second We really struck a cordI could compile a list of these sideways insults that are thrown at us daily and itd probably blow up the internetLooks like we got the people going lol I thought this stuff was more obvious than it is i guessIf you fall and get stuck in mud you pull yourself up by your boots straps to get up.The tax breaks for big corporations really bothers me. Why not give the money directly to the people so they can actually buy stuff...\s\sOh almost forgot that it's easier to oppress people if they struggle with not becoming homeless and other shit like that.>Why not give the money directly to the people so they can actually buy stuff...\s\sEspecially when their buying stuff is the actual motor of the economyWhy do businesses need customers when they can just get free handouts from the government?    /s[deleted]That‚Äôs what we did in Australia in the GFC and we did amazingly well and never went into recession. (The government gave all citizens a bunch of spending money and said government go nuts‚Äô)I think it‚Äôs all stranglehold on time. There will be a push to say work at home needs to do 50 hour weeks but going in office you can continue to work only 40.For the same reason the police state was create to kick peasants from the land and protect the land from people access so people find themself forced to work for somebody the keep the wealth of workers labour.Because the evidence is (most) people don‚Äôt actually buy stuff they pay down debt and that doesn‚Äôt help the economy get moving again.  If people actually did buy stuff then yeah that would be most helpful.  So rather than just chuck money at people most countries governments have used some variation of propping up businesses trying to keep businesses running so they keep their staff employed to try to keep some semblance of normality in terms of wages bills being paid etc.> Oh almost forgot that it's easier to oppress people if they struggle with not becoming homeless and other shit like that.\s\sDo you actually believe that is the case; you don't think there are economic and policy considerations?\s\s""A range of estimates suggests that the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] is likely to contribute to increased US capital investment and through that an increase in US wages.""

There is still wealth they just see ""losing"" a penny of revenue as the economy crashing. It's crashing for us but big money is hiding in the panic room waiting for the storm to be over so they can start collecting again.If they believed in capitalism then they would realize UBI would allow us to spend money. You know the whole consuming part of consumerism?\s\sInstead they are fixated on people getting something for nothing revealing that they believe humanity has no intrinsic value. Unless of course you are born rich then you earned it because your father was a successful business man and his son deserves the right to hoard his wealth for all time and never spend it.\s\sI don‚Äôt think we should take wealth away from the rich. But I do think they should be forced to spend their excessive cash hordes.\s\sThe economy stagnates when the rich don‚Äôt spend and the poor can‚Äôt consume.\s\sBetween not giving the poor what they deserve and letting the rich hoard more then they can spend the economy has the breaks on and it is slowing the economy to a halt for all of us.>I don‚Äôt think we should take wealth away from the rich.\s\sYou do know that Jeff Bezos makes more in a minute than his average employee makes in an entire year? This ""Lets just leave the rich alone"" is absurd. When then have been sucking value out of people at an increasingly obscene rate for decades. How productivity has been going up for decades but the average wage in real money has stayed the same. Where does that difference go? To the 1% of course to the people who own the businesses. This is why wealth inequality is such a huge issue. And don‚Äôt come tell me they earned their money like sure they did but it was also so much luck. What about the other thousands of people who work just as hard and are just as smart but just don‚Äôt get the same lucky opportunities. Tough luck for them i guess Go Capitalism! Wasting the lives and potential of 99% to make the 1% wealthy what a natural and rational arrangement that works for everyone!This is a brilliant job of summing that all up.Just take the cash out of the middle of the pile. They prolly won‚Äôt notice.This is it exactly. \s\sIt's happening. We aren't buying crap we don't need. And it's affecting their cashflow lol. Much like marriages. If a man doesn't participate then the women doesn't get any of his time effort or resources. It requires the man's participation.\s\sIn the same way if we don't buy the crap these corporations are selling their hoarded money will eventually be worth zero lol. Too bad so sad. #sorrynotsorryHow did UBI work out in Sweden? Did they implement UBI after the experiment ended?\s\sEdit: my bad it was Finland üá´üáÆJust FYI most rich people don't have excessive cash hoards. Having lots of cash is very unprofitable and you will lose a ton of money to inflation.\s\sA lot of wealth is just theoretical value tied up in stocks. And when they gain more wealth they didn't actually get more money. It's just that other people agree on a higher piece they'd be willing to pay for the stocks.\s\sSo a billionaire doesn't actually have several billions to spend. They don't actually have the money. There is no cash to spend. The wealth actually comes from owning shared in a business that people assign a theoretical value to.\s\sThey would only have billions of actual money if they were to sell their stocks. But by selling such huge amounts of stocks they might cause the price to plummet. And then several billions of this money would ""disappear"". Because they never had it in the first place. It's theoretical cash until someone buys what they sell.Labor > Capital.It was always that way it‚Äôs about time people are realizing it.The ‚Äújob creators‚Äù are magicians they make tax payer bail out money disappear and congress will do whatever it takes to fund their campaign with them green backs.r/Anarcho_Capitalism: ""SHUT"" \*inhale\* ""THE FUCK"" \*inhale\* ""***UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU--""***laugh reacts only at ayncaps[Jesus Christ that subreddit... ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/dJVjyfDj8eZpily4I3319KnCpSIx1Mrq9NtPCM46Fx5O-xVR1RbCCqGnpDbBvmFap9dpGNiLv1zU7Tr8MRddvvCuPi5UJaGsEclFSV7l0Ui9AHW6zh52ww3pDfNLtDEEYvQ8uZlDW-tZJHibgIb5BOrn1-txqITVghg)I feel ya but you don't actually need to link it.\s\sJust put a \\ before the \/\s\s**Example**: r\/Anarcho-capitalismI hope none of you start thinking that the modern economy of work for pay is some kind of scam that is rigged in any way at all.

And all i am hearing all day on the news is support your local businesses. Like it‚Äôs up to ME to fix their problems. Not the government not the banks not the people who screwed them over with the PPP loans that went to businesses like NIKE instead of actual small businesses.We create wealth with our labor and with our consumerism.Let's stop laboring and consuming.It's also funny how we don't need many of those products to consume.YepWe're all slaves to the elites who make the money the government is just there for a fake sense of security. They have the real power.This. How are people not aware of this by now?It is not the business owner that is the job creator  it is the consumer.So let's stop consuming. There is so much crap that people buy that we don't actually need.Almost as if you need both job-creators AND workers...If only this sentiment had steam in the meat world.!Remindme 1 datSo were the ‚Äújob creators‚Äù still just hangin out in the offices with no one doing anything? Also the economy wasn‚Äôt brought to its knees it declined and has rebounded relatively well sinceVote with you dollars people. Support local and trade for goods and services. Cut out the middle man that taxes you for making life complicatedsadly this is wrong. the working class becoming destitute from calamity has *not* brought the economy (the stock market as far as the upper class is concerned) to its knees or even caused it to pause for reflectionDon't forget the bravery of the upper-class wealth inheritors who took a huge risk hiring people to do slave work for them. We need to give these people increased tax cuts.So sadly this isn‚Äôt true with low interest rates. Big companies can just borrow their way out of this mess and wait till things get better. As for the workers at home you‚Äôre just fucked because now the GOP can say the stock market is going up and the economy is fine we don‚Äôt need another stimulus.This is when times change. The Black Œ°lague helped end feudalism when the people at the bottom started realizing that they were indispensable.Yeah strange how when people stop working everything collapses. It's almost like people need to work for there to be a functioning society y'know. Like goods actually have to be produced *and* consumed.We need to stop working. We only need to consume food and drink. Everything else is pretty much useless crap we don't need.Well we can stop working and the production will continue in China by a bunch of kids. Now let‚Äôs make the government give us money. But I still want my iPhone 19XPlus a few coffees a day and delivery food. Oh and never needing to pay for healthcare ever again.These days systems create the wealth but workers are a crucial part of the system--for now.This is trash and all of you that think work is not necessary are also trash. Enjoy the bottom rungs of society you modern day peasants.Look its baby hitlerAll work sucks but it is necessary to get where you want.I got a sticker the size of a strawberry at least she can turn that into poopI once got a ballpoint pen a block of post-its and a tea towel with the company logo for employee appreciation day. The day after we got an e-mail that we had to hand it back in because our department wasn't supposed to receive a gift. That's the only time I almost rage-quitted a job.God imagine being so bad at your job that you think it is a better idea to ask workers to hand their shitty free gifts back in rather than just pay ¬£100 for some more pens with the company name on to hand out to others.Damn that's sad. My hospital had free food trucks come out and everything from free food to free ice cream and premium coffee for an entire week straight.I got a cocolate barThis as an ""appreciation"" meal should show everyone what the people at the top think about all of us over worked normals they think we should be grateful for literal scraps. \s\s\sAnd they're not even trying to hide it anymore.My fianc√© got a gift from their hospital. It was a bag of seeds and a rock with the slogan ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a rock because Nurses Rock and so do you!‚ÄùI‚Äôve never met a nurse who‚Äôs happy with their job.Spent 18 months in NY state prison can tell you that what OP received was the dinner menu 1 night each week but we where at least given 2 hot dogs and a scoop of applesauce with it.\s\sAlso that terrible hot dog looks just like the type they serve behind the fence.Is it a tiny bun or a really girthy hotdog?Can I have the beans if you‚Äôre not gonna eat them?go to school and get a job they told me. fuck thatThe fuckNo way I would eat that garbageWorkers: what the hell is this?\s\sManagement: don't you like barbecue?\s\sWorkers: this isn't barbecue this is a ball park frank on a bun with beans and a pickle.\s\sManagement: Well we wanted to show our appreciation to the most important people here.\s\sWorkers: where's your food?\s\sManagement: All of this was meant for you. I got my bonus for bringing in the department under budget and senior leadership and the board members got their bonuses and raises from all your hard work.\s\sWorkers: we want a raise. \s\sManagement: that's not in the budget. Enjoy your barbecue!Hmmm....I mean...I get that that's a bad meal....but....I could go for a hot dog and baked beansI‚Äôm not comparing myself to those in medial profession that have been on front lines my company was declared essential so we continued to work. While company made huge profits during this time they changed coffee vending machines to free top leadership received bonuses of 15~30% and they shut down our 4-8% bonuses.  Also gave up raises of 2.7%.  Fuck them.BeansMan that sausage looks like a turd. Could they not have at least run to cheeseburgers?The hospital I work for had a bbq luncheon with a local bbq joint that is fairly famous and has great food. Problem is the luncheon was from 12-1. Most of the staff couldn't go because we have to take our breaks at 11 1115 and 1130. We have to be back by noon to feed residents.Man nothing says ""I went as cheap as possible "" like beans and hot dogsI remember getting a pen for nurse week.Omg! She got sent to Fyre Fest???Just looking at this gave me diarrhea. You deserve actual good food not this pitiful excuse for nutrients.This sucks I've got two family members that work in the local hospital and the meals they got were infinitely better than this. It's just painful to see how bad the system is for some.She still ate it tho?....In Prison we call that Donkey DickHold up is that a Vlasic pickle though? They pack a good crunch.Looks like a slice of zucchini to meUntil I read this I thought it was the thinnest slice of melonJesus i thought it was a tiny banana at firstOkay that actually looks delicious but I agree its too little food.What on Earth looks delicious on this?Don‚Äôt they know that she already has alive sausage at home waiting for her? Alive usage with throbbing vein? on serious note that food looks worse than prison food.I don‚Äôt see anything wrong in this photoOn a related note our school district just passed a ‚Äúunanimous resolution‚Äù recognizing all the work all the teacher have done during the pandemic and they thanked us with..... a bucket of Costco cookies. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èYou get food on the job? You can afford food? Oh man...I've had better lunch in public city high schoolsWho ordered the Fyre Festival Special?Literally looks like she got served a shit sandwichSmh.. Grocery store near me gave their employees pizza slices and cupcakes for appreciation weekCan't tell if that's cucumber or melon. Either way it's the saddest piece I've ever seen.I'm French and food is more serious than anything else\s\sIf someone serve that food to anyone in my country I'm pretty sure it's legal to killThat's rehab/shelter/prison food.I honest to God believe this would be my ""flip the table"" moment.Wow what a slap in the face.That‚Äôs just insulting‚ÄîI‚Äôd put this disgusting pic on every social media platform I could making sure to name the hospitalI got a Twix barYum[I got a rock](https://youtu.be/5tIhwITwhSg?t=26).Not a nurse but I work the the mental health field and last year our ""employee appreciation week"" consisted of wear a sports jersey day and a bring your own dessert to share with coworkers day.  Total cost to the employer $0.\s\sMeanwhile they laid people off ""due to COVID"" even though we're busier than ever  haven't given a raise since 2019 and stopped contributing to our 401Ks.Whenever we do staff appreciation it‚Äôs ‚Äúpotluck‚Äù style. So we get the fun of cooking our own food instead of having it catered.Literally thought I was seeing this on r/shittyfoodpornBeans ü§§You should see what the US military feeds their service members in chow halls/cafeterias. \s\sOn a secondary note they‚Äôre also given no choice but to eat that as $400 is removed from their wallet monthly to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for it.BruhHospitals have been taken over by terrible administrators that sit on their ass all day. I worked at one of the richest hospitals in the country. One of the busiest OR's in the state. The penny pinched the OR staff and worked them to the bone. The janitors and patient transporters were all tracked by tech devices and treated like slaves.Damn I got better lunches in schoolWoah.  What the hell.This pissed me off so much I devolved back into an ape shit in my hand and pitched it at a wall.Looks better than anything the Army gets from the DFAC.At my facility we got a $10 target card... I‚Äôm just floored they even handed that much out to their nursesIn situations like this you need to name the hospital.   They need their name run through the mud.You‚Äôre complaining that a system that can‚Äôt fulfill obligations to your liking also cannot provide extras to your liking. Tell me what did you expect?Looks better than what they give patients in summer hospitals. \s\sLet me guess... Aramark.She got a meal? We got an ice cream bar where I work (supposedly we were to get a coffee mug too but it hasn't happened yet). Also all employees of the hospital were notified that there was to be no raises for 2020 and they followed through with the plan. A few weeks later the front page of the local newspaper announced the multimillion dollar property that was purchased from a large insurance company. Sound like a for profit hospital? Nope  it is a nonprofit.All Hospitals need to be take over as municipal utilities/services and insurance needs to be erradicated entirely. Provide the service at no charge at point of us and fund it by taxes (with a progressive tax structure if that isnt obvious).An unexpected adversary to those kinds of ‚Äúnonprofits‚Äù was Chuck Grassley. He wrote an op ed about them and even got some legislation passed making it harder for nonprofit hospitals to be for profit. I think it only applied to his state though. I‚Äôll see if I can find the legislation and/or article.\s\sEdit: not the article I was looking for but a decent source of information.\s\shttps://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-colleagues-rules-non-profit-hospitals-need-scrutinyI used to think ‚ÄúNon-Profit‚Äù was indicative of an altruistic mission to serve the public or whatever.  Now I see all these ‚Äúnon-profit‚Äù hospital systems with mega real estate portfolios fitness centers and ungodly amounts of money wrapped up in different investments it makes me think ‚Äúnon-profit‚Äù is just a way to describe ‚Äútax shelter.‚ÄùYou work for Shands too huh?Such bullshit. UNICEF is a ‚Äúnon-profit‚Äù too. CEO makes 1.2m and has a fucking Rolls Royce as his company car.That is one sad pickleI completely walked away from the field of nursing in 2018 for this reason - a pandemic isn‚Äôt when this poor treatment started and the job has always been a pretty heavy load to bear with little thanks and not nearly enough pay (most places). \s\sDeeply saddened to see that not even a global crisis improved the ‚Äúappreciation week gifts‚Äù. Nurses who are still in it my heart goes out to you! Your wife and others deserve better OP!All we got was a letter saying ‚Äúthank you for your hard work and dedication‚Äù. Hospital don‚Äôt give two shits about its employeesWe got rocksA slap in the face would have been more satisfying that's fucked up!!!I'd just fucking quit.\s\sFuck that chuck that shit at whatever ""higher up"" is grinning like a pedo at a pool party and just walk out the fucking door.\s\sShit like this riles me more than anything better to just get a ""cheers guys thanks for your hard work"" than this insulting bullshitDepending on the nursing profession that would basically be throwing away years of education work and most importantly seniority (if this is a union).""I'd just fucking quit.""\s\sOk try having a mortgage.Welcome to AmericaThat is a slap in the face.  How insulting!I work at *Walmart* for fucks sake and our appreciation meal was at least from a local caterer. It showed up late but like it was damn good food. I would have dumped this tray and held up dual middle fingers as I walked out to go start applying for somewhere new.Dang your wife got a free meal? My hospital skipped that and instead hired a mariachi band to play during lunch. LmaoThis is the shittiest food porn I‚Äôve ever seen.At least they gave you the correct amount of beans 239 to be exact. Just one more extra would make you too farty.So was that hospital closed because there's now no nurse'sDoes she work at Fyre Festival?We got a jar of candy and the nurses station decorated with a 6 yo boys superhero birthday party decorations. Never have I wanted to light things on fire so much....Dude just burn the place to the groundWhy do we let the bean counters run the world?Oligarchs run the world.  Bean counters serve as a buffer between the raw evil of billionaires and the life experience of productive workers.  In an economy that keeps turning out more goods and services stagnant or declining standards of living among workers requires a lot of shenanigans disguised as due process.  One indicator of our dystopia is the rise of careers in finance -- when the economy was a lot less crooked it didn't take so many apologists to maintain faith in the wisdom of systematic exploitation by a mix of shadowy investors and celebrity narcissists.God you're not kidding. I've seen so many scenarios at my workplaces where the accountants simply assign a number to something (let's say a position that has just been vacated) and it's passed to executive leadership. Now you would think executive leadership knows what they're doing being in such a position of responsibility/authority but you forget that this is the U.S. where corruption/nepotism runs wild. \s\sSo the leadership goes with the cheapest route never asks any questions to understand the situation etc. They throw a body to fill the role (at the cheapest salary possible) and watch as years go by before the new hire (if they are still around) are contributing anywhere near the old person who left (likely because they were too cheap to pay the person properly). Then the cycle repeats in perpetuity.Because at the end of the day companies only care about money and those people that run the money tend to be valued mostI'm a bean counter.  I wish I ran the world.  All I do is count beans for the people who own them.  I wish I counted beans for better people or even a socialist enterprise but c'est la vie.It took a while for the picture to load and this is SO much worse than I imagined.I‚Äôd rather have nothing.I work in distribution for a major drug store. At the worst of the covid panic when we were being forced to work our off days to send out thousands upon thousands of cases of toilet paper and hand sanitizer we couldn‚Äôt buy ourselves because our store‚Äôs prices are fucking ridiculous and who wants to go to the store after a 12 hour shift in a hot dirty warehouse just to find the shelves empty anyway upper management decided to show their ‚Äúappreciation‚Äù for us by giving everyone one case of store brand water and one 4-pack of the shittiest single ply toilet paper you can imagine. Approximate value: $4.This is still better than those nurses that got rocks LOLGetting fucked by the metaphorical frank and bean penis mealThe pickle looks edible at least! Im sure you feel very appreciated. We will work you till your dead like we did to this food.This is what the patient's eat and prisoners....[deleted]That's only the big pharma kickbackshttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/it-would-take-1000-years-for-the-average-employee-to-earn-what-their-ceo-makes-in-just-one-study-says-2019-09-30Non profit hospital CEO‚Äôs don‚Äôt earn that much actually. Under 1m. Still a lot but not insane like the for profit hospitalsDefinitely not that much. Our NP CEO makes 400k. They do a ton of work as well. 12+ hours a day.That‚Äôs vileLooks like the meal my elementary aged kids get served for their end of year picnics.That‚Äôs pathetic. If they were going to do a meal to show ‚Äúappreciation‚Äù they could at least have made it seem genuine and do burgers or baked chicken or something.The most messed up part of this is night shift didn't even get that!!!!What the fuckCanned beans boiled hot dog and a quarter of a pickle.\s\sPinnacle of British foodThis is just sad.I‚Äôm not going to give out details as to where this is from just to keep her out of any shit this hospital group has done nothing but step all over they‚Äôre staff this year. Not giving any raises hazard pay or any real protection in the case of a positive covid test. For the first month of Covid they had a policy where they‚Äôd give you 2 weeks paid time off without having to touch your PTO or Sick time but once Covid actually got bad and nurses were dropping like flies they axed that plan. They ran out of PPE and forced Nurses to wear single use protection for months at a time. They beg nurses to come in and work 5-6 days a week yet they treat them like this. But hey here‚Äôs a fucking hot dog.>this hospital group\s\sI knew it.  This reeks of giant hospital corporation that was probably insanely profitable last year.   \s\sThese corporations own almost every hospital now days and they are horrible to deal with from the patient side as well.   You might as well be dealing with loan sharks and car salesman all rolled into one.  They are going to upsale you and overcharge you and then strap you with insane debt and they can give two shits if they actually find out what's wrong with you.I hope none came an went elsewhereFuck for-profit healthcareWhere is this place ??!What a slap in the face!That is one gross ass.....hotdog??? Ugh scratch that what the fuck even is that?Be strong this will be a luxury after the next election and the next pandemicwhat we are experiencing now is just a warmup.People that do not believe in science in control a whole lot worse!Id throw that shit out. Fuck them. Reminds me when we got 1 dollar frozen pies from our warehouse as ""appreciation"". Shit sucked least to say. Wish companies would stop being cheap giving out only food and give some fucking bonuses!This past year has been quite a wake up call for those of us in the helping professions. We‚Äôre all wholly and utterly expendable to people in power. Fuck the system indeed.Just this week I found myself in a situation where I‚Äôve broken my dominant arm can‚Äôt drive can‚Äôt write can‚Äôt hardly pull up my own pants. My boss calls wants me into work the next day. I said no I have a Drs note that says 2-6 weeks out. He sends an Uber the next day and sends out messages to the rest of the lab referring work to me over the next week so I presume he expected me to return as normal. I put my resignation in that afternoon.I worked as a grocery store cashier during the start of covid and it was so fucked on so many levels. I‚Äôve been sitting here for like 10 minutes trying to type up a succinct version of events and I just can‚Äôt manage because it was such an extended chain of bullshit and stress wondering if it was worth it every hour of every shift feeling desperation and anxiety over every choice and action. I had unmasked old ladies getting super pissed off at me when I‚Äôd take a huge step back from them while I‚Äôd be crying after work because I was afraid that with the sheer amount of person to person contact I had THEY were the ones at risk. I was afraid I was going to KILL them. \s\sOh and the ‚Äúhero pay‚Äù I was initially very happy to hear about it but my job became unbearable even for the extra money. I started to struggle to get through my scheduled shifts and when they cut that pay but the job was still dangerous and shitty? Like a piece of my soul died.For workers appreciation day at my last cleaning job we got screamed at! Yay! We had so much fun. /sAt our hospital holiday party one year the CFO served the Costco already cooked shrimp to make sure each employee got only exactly three.  No seconds.   \s\sNow that I type this I realize we at least got shrimp and not rocks.I really hope you're kidding because that's disgusting when you consider the fat bastard who signed off on this was probably earning at least 6 figures a year and eating lobster and drinking champagne at the same time while billing it to the tax payer.Did they just grab whatever was left over in the cafeteria? Hospital food ain't great but that ""plate"" looks bad... really bad.My daughter worked the night shift. There was never any food left for the night shift.My fianc√©e got an oversized t-shirt a cupcake and a pear.\s\s\s\sHappy Nurses Week y'all!This some West Virginia shit üòÇMy wife has an interview with a private practice. I'm so happy for her and tired of the hospital garbage I've heard about.This looks like a middle school lunch.Did any nurse go to management and throw it at them? What a fucking slap in the face. Just appalling.This is essentially telling her that her worth is lower than the prisoners.FRANK AND BEANS!!!!!Meanwhile the healthcare/hospital CEOs are dining on steaks. \s\sI just want to drag these people into the streets.You guys got food? My unit got stickers that had ‚ÄúNurses Week‚Äù on themThoughts and prayers (as long as you don't unionize). Be best.At my job instead of covid pay we got a cringy pin that said something like heroes work here. And this is a time where the company is making more money than ever thanks to the virus. What a jokeWe had something similar in stupidity for ""engineers' week"" at my work. It really blows my mind how dumb/disconnected leadership must be to decide to recognize engineers' week by putting signs up everywhere emails announcements etc. and then follow up with a sticker lmao. \s\sAre they really that dumb to think we would appreciate a sticker? Just save everyone the time and hassle by simply not acknowledging the week at all instead of insulting the people designing testing and creating the entire reason the company exists.We got a celebratory email.You guys got stickers? Guess what we got for lab week.   \s\s""Happy nurses week"" stickers.that's utterly infuriating.My sister is a nurse at her hospital they got a single orange. She was telling us that at other hospitals in the area some got ""Pet Rocks"" but no eyes so just rocks.Lol. We got rocks and were featured on some internet memeing.Hey I know a local hospital that told the nurses to give each other ‚Äúair high fives‚Äù for doing so great and then turned around and put out an ad asking for donations for ‚Äúnurse‚Äôs week.‚Äù\s\sGuess where *that* money isn‚Äôt going‚Äîcause it‚Äôs definitely not to caregivers.Our nurses got yellow stress balls with emojis on them. Acknowledging the job is stressful but doing absolutely nothing about it lol.Wait what? Stickers?\s\sAt my job we got threatened. Show up to work or get written up. The reward was having a job.\s\sAt the height of things myself and coworkers were working 16 hours a day 3 or 4 days a week. If any of us made even a small mistake we still got written up. No leniency given the situation.\s\sAs rough as that was I couldn't imagine doing as much as the healthcare workers. Fortunately I didn't need your services but thanks anyway.You got stickers? They just made the nurses in my department make a promo video for FacebookHey you got stickers! No one ever notices Lab Week.Pathetic and with the money the hospitals receive this is truly pathetic.I heard the hospital board took 4 hours to decide whether to include the pickle or not.See how thinly its sliced? Someone probably got a bonus for that shit too.I bet prison food is better than thisThis looks like some shit a public high school would give out during some stupid event tbh....Looks like fucking jail food.Damn. No sauerkraut. Ain‚Äôt that some bullshitAnd i bet they were those shit ‚ÄúS BAR‚Äù brand hot dogs tooThat's a sad looking dog...If they're gonna waste all that plastic at least they could fill it with food. My lunch in 6th grade of primary was like 3 times the size of this mealWe can‚Äôt spend any more money on these meals profits are to for the hospital owners not the laborers.Atleast you have food dude some people have nothingWow!She needs to vote with her feet and find a new job. Lots of nursing openings.The NHS: you guys are getting food?A whole pickle spear baked beans and a big ol hot dog. Well golly those nurses sure do get appreciated...\s\s/sBeautiful food 10/10NOT THE GLIZZYPlease post the name of the healthcare provider who ok'd this!Bet the top person in charge of the hospital is rich af.That almost seems deliberately insulting.Lol ems week we get a breakfast burrito and a child size backpack with out logo on it. So same. I feel this post.As a teacher I feel this.  I recieved 1 Costco Cookie individually wrapped for teacher appreciation week.  (US).  Feeling the love.Almost became an RN‚Äîrealized just how exploited I would be‚Äîsaid fuck that.I hear you - as a 20 year old I remember strongly considering becoming a doctor. Then I considered the many years of college the huge amounts of student loans and the ""all-in"" aspect that if I had to withdraw at any point (illnesses injuries etc.) I would be stuck with huge loans and have no ability to get a high-paying job to repay them.\s\sWe already have huge disincentives (in terms of insane college costs and others) to entering the medical field. Add this last year of exploitation and I'm extra glad I chose another path.This is an accurate representation of how much your bosses and 95% of your elected officials value you. \s\sThis is what they think you're worth. \s\sYou're dispensable you don't deserve prosperity. \s\sYou eat your hot dog bun and cold baked beans and fucking thank god they gave you a job.Omfg ü§¨1/16 of a green thing one vomit and the most disgusting... hotdog? that I ever saw.\s\sYum.The hotdog‚Äôs sort of crackingBruh that might be a Nathan's.This isn't an oversight it's an example. Things are working as intended the standard operating procedure was/is/will be to screw us.\s\s*""You still don't matter you aren't going to get any ‚Äòspecial treatment‚Äô(basic worker's rights) for doing three people's jobs for the past year and a half the bonuses and raises will be going to management as usual know your place and stay where you belong: as a cog in the machine. You are nothing and if we're being threatened with regulation or change in the near future all the more reason to take whatever we can from you before things change peasant.""*\s\sThat's the message management has been sending us this whole time it's just now the majority is hearing them and have options to step away.Oh yum! Botulism!We all gotta quit man feels like the only way to change is to stop working at once. It's going to hurt it's truly is for everyone but if nothing is done then nothing will change.Damn. I‚Äôm in the military and we do the occasional burger burn or get some BBQ and it‚Äôs usually pretty good like oh hey cool a free meal. This is just insulting I had better food when I was deployedI would take the worst MRE over this any fucking day.Thanks for all you do here‚Äôs a fat weinerThe time for nurse worship is over. These people knowingly joined a terribly corrupt healthcare system that destroys families. Fuck American healthcare workers.My boss bought pizza for employees last week. Made a big deal about ordering a ""vegetarian pizza"" for the non-carnivores. It was a single round plain cheese pizza. There were about a dozen other meat varieties both round and deep-dish. Sigh.Meanwhile ceo 250000 salary works from homeTry 40 times that they made about 10-15 million last yearLmao!  $250k for a CEO at a hospital?  Off by at least 1 order of magnitude.This is the same crap they served at my school but worse.\s\sI had mayonnaise  soup with stale crackers for lunch once.At my school the kids who didn't realize their lunch accounts had no money (bc why would they they're kids?!) The cashier would take their lunch and throw it in the trash. I'm not even joking. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what a fucking disgrace.>mayonnaise  soup\s\sWhat the hell is that supposed to be?What the fuck is ""mayonnaise soup""?\s\sEdit: Okay it was already explained further down and all I can say is What the fuck... HOW IN THE FUCK CAN ANYONE MAKE THAT CALL IT FOOD AND GIVE IT TO FUCKING CHILDREN?!So basically just oil soup?That's some invader zim shit.WTF our place gave us Jersey Mike's lunches. Sandwich chips cookie and a drink all in a box with a thank you note. Wtf is this shit?They could‚Äôve gotten a better deal at the Costco food court.Yeah at my hospital we were given cold burgers with NO CHEESE. They literally refused to give us cheese.‚ÄûOhne Mampf kein Kampf‚Äú ‚Äûno food nonfight‚Äú is a german saying. Means: If you want to have good people being loyal doing their best give them good food. Many mutinies started because of bad food.\sShame on the hospital for this pathetic decision.Looks delicious not gonna liePizza Party!!! \s\sSeriously though I have no idea why middle management thinks these ideas could ever improve morale. At my last job they would try to ""incentivize"" us with a good time. This usually meant that they'd offer to come to our store to wash our cars grill some hotdogs from the stock we sell on roller grills (convenience store) and offer the team a day off to chill with them. \s\sNevermind getting any time off was like pulling teeth you could tell they have tons of free time in their roles.What a DisgraceOr go work for another hospital? Have yet to see a hospital that‚Äôs not hiring nurses over the past 12 months.Did she ever stay past her shift for free?Welcome to #fyrefestivalWhat? No mini can of diet Shasta?

Not only did she get a card but it also contained a packet of 3 whole sunflower seeds! What a thank you for getting ill looking after those taken seriously ill by the pandemic seeing many die watching her colleagues die and having to distance herself from the kids and I. \s\sOh and 'clap for carers' was virtue signalling bollocks she would have more appreciated a cold bottle of water during one of her many 13 hour shifts. The public really didn't give a toss about our nurses but wanted to make 'caring' social media posts/videos to appear as if they did.One of my local hospitals paid for a cheesecake truck to come out and let the nurses get whatever type of cheesecakes they wanted. My friend owns that cheesecake food truck.I would just dump this shit face down in front of the administrative officeThat hot dog is as green as the pickle xDI'd rather shit in my hand and clap than attempt to eat that.[deleted]Guarantee you this hospital is more profitable than your private school.  Unless it's a rural hospital.looks like a god damn human turd???Geez my doughy breakfast bread from high school looks more appetizing. That‚Äôs awful :/. Let her know that even if her workplace doesn‚Äôt appreciate her we do :)They serve better food to the patient in the hospital I work atDoes she work in a jail?\sAt least they catered in carrabbas for the place i was atDuring nurses week at our hospital we got absolutely nothing!!!That‚Äôs fucked upr/shittyfoodpornWorked COVID in the ED the beginning of COVID transitioned to the floors at its peak and I got a bagel for nurse‚Äôa week. I was particularly hungry Friday morning but we could only get one.You'd probably get something that looked less inedible and pathetic at the local soup kitchen.I‚Äôm with you on this brother. Fuck the system.Looks like they diverted some of the local prisons food to the hospital.My former employer didn't give anyone food.  Apparently it's cheaper to just hang banners that read ""Heroes Work Here"" in front and call it a day.I've received better quality meals at a soup kitchen.My mom was an X-Ray tech at the same hospital for like 20 years. Their 20 year appreciation gift was something similar. It was like a $20 gift card.\s\sYou would think that management would understand that no lunch or no gift would be better than a shitty lunch or gift. But they don't.Ah yes. The gift cards. That they then report on your paycheck as income so you end up paying taxes on it.Oh now I get it they forgot the mustard.Everyone in this thread is complaining but that looks fine to me.  Free lunch better than no free lunch.I worked at a very bougie grocery store during thanksgiving & by no means am I saying my job was as important as a nurse's they still called us ""essential."" My coworkers told me how since we have a full kitchen in the store they usually have a huge thanksgiving buffet complete with *everything* I'm talking multiple turkeys every fixing you can think of ciders you name it they had it but they weren't sure how they were going to handle it with the pandemic this year they figured they'd just portion out the food & we could grab a box to take home. Well they ended up doing that but inside was a turkey sandwich a bag of chips & a packet of fruit snacks. But here's the kicker they gave customers a FREE 8""x10"" sampler platter with green beans brussels scalloped potatoes carrots bread pudding & sweet potato pie the only thing missing was the turkey. We weren't allowed to ask for a sample platter either even off the clock & we couldn't even have the extras after the giveaway was over they just threw them out. I had to spend thanksgiving alone & they gave me a fucking sandwich. I ended up just getting chinese takeout fuck corporate dude.They couldn't pay for decent catering? SMFH.number one.\sFUCK MANAGEMENT\sthey wear these tight suits and dont do JACK SHIT\sthey dont know anything about healthcare but yet they run shit\sfucking finance majors that run hosp operations\s\si feel ya on this. my hospital did the same shit they gave out pens to make it any betterIs she a nurse in prison?fyre fest 101I'm New Zealand the govt have frozen all public servants pay including our nurses and other medical professionals. The pay freeze means no pay rises for the next 3 years. And the PM called them heroes but aren't giving them what they deserve?Hmmm.... Saint Jacinda is doing that?  Well fuck.They could have just ordered pizza damn.holy shitI have severe depression just from looking at this pic.[deleted]That can‚Äôt be fucking real üò°This is how 'heroes' are rewarded in the USA.Nurses and all ‚Äúthe essential workers‚Äù for that matter should have used the pandemic to demand better wages and working conditionsThat is the most pathetic pickle I've ever seen in my life and I take a shower every day.And did anyone say anything to management or did they quietly complain amongst themselves and post this obscure pic on Reddit before going back to work?Probably some shit that was about to expire so they gave it away and said it was for appreciation lol.what is this the Great Depression? where are the condiments for that dog?!? \s\sdear god whomever perpetrated this travesty on hard working nurses needs to be strapped bare-assed on a block of ice and force-fed Limburger cheese.And this is why I am taking time away from nursing and going back to school to advance my career. The last year really burnt me out.This seems fake. Anyone can post a picture of a lame meal and make people think they are oppressed.We the people appreciate your wife and all like her- thank her from the voices of RedditLast year when COVID was just starting to ramp up and everything was shutting down it was during Laboratory week in the hospital which was understandably canceled. A month or two later there was a massive nurse appreciation week for all they did during COVID; well deserved but the lab constantly gets kicked to the curb. A job well done in the lab is usually met with a pat on the back from other lab employees and maybe some stale generic apple chips or something.The beans spilling onto the pickle is a nice touch.Maybe my mom was right to work in government ran hospitals.\s\sHer meals are catered to her choice. She even gets to pick the restaurant of her choice. All nurses get to pick their own restaurant but are encouraged to group order a single one because it will arrive faster.\s\sAnd she‚Äôs not even a high rank anything she‚Äôs a normal nurse.""Thanks""That's the closest to say ""get fucked"" with food that I've ever seen.Damn! This reminds me of my work. We had ‚ÄúSoup Day‚Äù at my work. They gave all us employees ‚ÄúCup of Noodles‚Äù with a 3 count saltine cracker pack. While upstairs had Porto‚Äôs (I don‚Äôt like that either) BUT still it really shows how they don‚Äôt care about us.Bro I hope this is in the EMS lounge next week for EMS week!Holy shit this looks like a prison mealliterally some garbage they got on discount from the cafeteria's weekly sysco orderI‚Äôm sure they went through the effort of buying that disgusting hot dog thingy just to let the staff know they can go fuck themselves.[deleted]Nah. More like a case of hot dogs Sysco gave them free since they were freezer burned AND moldy.That is 1 thick weeny....That glizzy be thiccccc[deleted]As a resident physician I got an apple for doctors day this year.I'm in accounting.  Here is how it went.  They had a budget meeting.  The executive said spend $X on nurses appreciation.  This is what was afforded by $X/# of nurses.  \s\sIt's more of a do the bare minimum for virtue signaling purposes situation.[deleted]Don‚Äôt forget about that pickle sliceAnd some probably quietly panicked because they *knew* this would be incredibly messed up but knew they'd go forward with it anyways.Let‚Äôs go all in and make it the jumbo dogs for them‚Ä¶But we get to enjoy the ""eating beans meme "" one more timeMy employer gave everyone a $20 coupon for appreciation week.\s\sThankfully we can use it for an Amazon gift card. Otherwise there's like 3 options for company logo shit.\s\sIf you want a sweatshirt or bag it's $40 so you still have to pay for shit with the company logo on it.thats literally worse than my school meal! (well... my school meal isnt bad sometimes its good but theres certainly better things lol)I'm saddened (but not surprised) to hear it. Your wife and many of the other professional healthcare workers continued working hard despite society failing them in so many ways over the past year. It proves their excellent character while showing the despicable way our society treats people.\s\sI could never work in this field - especially after witnessing the last year. I wonder how many potential healthcare professionals in the U.S. are passing to another field after watching how the industry treated its people during the pandemic.I'm one. I was a respiratory therapist for 10 years. I was getting pretty burned out in bedside care before the pandemic hit. It just put the final nail in the coffin.\s\sI decided to toss away the degree and time I've spent in the field when I was wearing the same N95 mask into the covid unit for weeks at a time. The longest I had one was 5 months. PPE was locked away from us. We ended up getting a new supplier for n95 masks but they came without a seal. N95s are already not meant for duplicate use so giving us some without seals with the intention of reusing it made me realize my life isn't worth my job. I work in a factory now and I'm the happiest I've ever been. I make shit money but my work/life balance is much healthier.[deleted]Here. Got a nursing degree and have sat on it cause I refuse to work under the conditions. Wife is a nurse who is scrambling to get out of the hospital system. I work in manufacturing and make less than her but  don‚Äôt have to kill myself to make a living.an interesting thing my wife's hospital dealt with sending too many of its employees home. people didnt want to go to the hospital for minor things. no elective surgeries. People were getting called off at such a high rate they allowed them to use long term sick pay to cover the loss of work. \s\sCovid was worse this last winter so it wasnt as much of an issue then. I'm not sure about hazard pay but my wife's floor wasnt a covid floor though a few patients tested positive. The lack of PPE is disturbing. recently they implemented an appropriate heavier duty mask for work instead of your basic ones. They said because covid is more contagious through the air so they have to yet no one wears these at any stores.Alright. I understand that these workers do not expect a t bone steak but a cafeteria dog and baked beans? And I highly doubt that management feasted on the same. What was to be appreciated? That it was ""free?"" What the actual fuck.Is that a quarter of a pickle? Couldn‚Äôt even stump for a whole pickle?I worked in various flavors of critical care for about ten years. I left three years ago to go to barber school and haven't looked back. Now I own a barbershop. I cut hair and bullshit with dudes all day long for the same pay. Fuck healthcare.They would have been far better not to have had a meal at all.     That meal looks awful   the bread isn't even buttered or with sauce.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sIt's insulting.\s\sNot even on a proper plate with proper cutlery.That's a chubby wiener.Just shaking my head in disgust and empathy. We got what ice cream was left from day shift. I'm lactose-intolerant. ThanksThe gas station specialThis doesn't even hold a match to *gas station food*.  I mean seriously you ever been to a Loves?  Their food is better than this.....abomination.The number one reason people file for bankruptcy is medical bills. \s\sHate yo break up you your wife has been working for one the most corrupt systems in the US. You‚Äôre shocked now because they gave her a crappy meal? Maybe she could buy her own meal and pat herself on the back.Nurse here in Vancouver... you got a free meal!!!??The fuck is that ?!Not gonna lie that looks delicious as hell. Little hot sauce some ice water bam. I‚Äôd eat the hell out of that. Guess I‚Äôm trash. Still gonna eat it.Atleast theres a pickleHospital I work at didn‚Äôt even have beans. Just a hotdog lol‚Ä¶.Clap for the underpaid. üëèI feel under-appreciated just from looking at this and I'm not even a nurse.The only good nutrition there is the beans.\sEdit: oh fuck I did NOT realise that was a slice of.. Uh.. Cucumber? Ok fuck.Did they got these cheap meals from their local prison?I can almost guarantee both the prison and the hospital use the same food provider.Looks tasty. Can I have it?Isn‚Äôt this a set of stool samples?Good sign things are getting back to normalyo capitalismThis reminds me of that one Son of the Beach episode where a character had to choose between a sausage or taco for lunch. The whole show was just one big euphemism.Lmao I always packed my own lunch when worked feed us . Fuck them I work to feed myself .which one do you go fuck yourself with the banana or the hot dog?If you want some free karma repost this on r/shittyfoodpornThe hospital in my town gave everyone a free coupon for a soft drink at their cafeteria for a Christmas bonusThe key to all human civilization since the dawn of it until now has been based on one main thing -- never let the slaves forget they are slaves while doing your best to not directly call them that (except for the few instances when it didn't even matter and you could).Slaves?\s‚ÄúUhhhhh I mean‚Ä¶..prisoners with jobs.  That‚Äôs better right?‚Äù[""The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.""](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007)today on the 'neoliberal' menu we have..........Bro y'all so ungrateful that dog is fat ashellI can imagine that upon viewing this at least one nurse   had a breakdown and started crying. It‚Äôs straws like these that breaks the camel‚Äôs back.My wife got a water bottle (for like the 3rd time in 5 years).FUCK THIS!!!Last year we got a scavenger hunt. Because that makes sense to have a bunch of people digging around a covid unit with all this luxurious free time we have. And the end prize when we found the last clue? Our desk jockey manager revealed that she was pregnant I shit you not.Lol I got a 5 dollar gift card for anything you can buy in the hospital. Aren‚Äôt we so appreciated?!?wtf this is slave slop.Slave slop is my new favourite phrase just for the alliteration.Bootlickers: Hey that's good food that's good food!But you dipshits will still line up for their very profitable vaccineüòÇBut what is your wage? Do they pay you fairly?For the amount of work and shit they have to deal with they are underpaidüíØ - the lunch is beside the point. \s\sIf she's paid fairly the lunch doesn't matter because she's being paid fairly. If she's not paid fairly the lunch doesn't matter because it can't make up for it. \s\sAlthough as a sidenote while the lunch certainly doesn't look good it doesn't really look much worse than say a school cafeteria lunch.Looks like a fancy prison mealSlave slop with gnarly weiner. I would just choke on the weiner to finally end it.Fuck that use the weiner to choke the people responsible for this.  Only instance I'd force a weiner in someone's mouth against their will....CFOs in the healthcare system are literally some of THE worst people on the planet.This is such a clever way for management to say fuck you you replaceable peon. Fuck this place and all just like it and take Capitalism along with the rich to fuck off town.Your wife gets a free meal at work? Must be nice.[removed]We'd appreciate it if you didn't use misogynistic language.\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

Did you lose your job? You go to work for a paycheckif you aren't happy with working conditions then leave.Damn.. they going gourmet on that food.

Think of the savings that will go into hospital administration pockets!\s\sCapitalism is a zero sum game you don't make profits by serving your wage slaves steak and caviar boys!We have been ignored  disrespected from the whole country system While jeopardizing our lives everyday \sVery corrupted system .My wife is a nurse and worked through the pandemic last year. For nurses appreciation week this week she and some of her co workers received a gift card to Jimmie John's ( a sandwich shop) for a free sandwich. With only a 2 catches. 1. Its redeemable at one location and this location is an hour and half away from the hospital they work at. And it's in downtown New Orleans. 2. Time machine is not included but needed because it expired 3 months ago.Not even cheap pizza? What the fuck lol. This is so insulting.I remember when the internet didn‚Äôt make me angry every few minutes :-(I think I would have testing on the stop. Canada is hiring almost anyone who works in health right nowDid they take these from the patients rooms? ü§®No from there stomachs[removed]At least in jail the food is better than this at least 90% of the time. I got country fried steak a couple times. Even juvi food wasn't that bad.\s\sHonestly I usually ate better when I was locked up than when I wasn't.\s\sEdit: I just want to say that when I was in jail the people inside were *really* big on mutual respect. Our cell had around 20 people in it. If you didn't keep your space clean or started to smell like ass b/c you didn't shower - those things were considered disrespectful.\s\s They saw I was a skinny dude and could probably tell how hungry I was by how fast I finished the trays of food. They would always be giving me extra helpings off their own plates or even commissary foods. Invite me to pray even though they knew I was atheist and just talk about religion and our different beliefs peacefully. I gained a couple pounds in the two weeks I spent in jail.Based on my friend's dad's stories (he's a corrections officer) this is pretty much what you get in the slammerShe'd be saving other people's lives if she did. That food does not look edible.I wish i have that food in hospital or in elementary school.\s\sThat is truth for czech republic as well. Much better food in prison than in hospitals. In hospital CZ food will make you vomit. What i see on picture it is only a bit of lousy not that bad - still bad if you have to pump so much your own money to system though.\s\sIn elementary school situation got better 10 - 15 years ago but still lot of elementary schools serve shit nobody will eat. In salvation army you have delicious food compared to this.she'd also probably be less likely to get COVID and have more free timeLOL hotdog day least we got two dogs came with mustard and tomato sauce side of chocolate cake. god forbid if they ever gave us a cucumber slice we woulda rioted not even joking.It's a person who makes even less than a nurse. They picked the most pristine pickle they had. Don't get mad at them.It seems as if they want to see your wife with a weiner in her mouth. Joking my friend. That is seriously crappy of them.I'm a nurse at on of the top respiratory hospitals in the country. We got a cookie. Mind you it was a FANCY cookie... But c'monnnnHaha it looks like a literal shit sandwich. What a f disgrace offering this up to our nurses.That is insulting for sureUnfortunately a pretty honest reflection of how little nurses are valued despite the extremely important value they provide.I am sorry you had to go through this. Looks like they were being to cheap. Could have used much more food than they gave you. That's not even a meal. Skimpy.Sorry  you didn‚Äôt (be born to an affluent wealthy family) achieve enough in school. You don‚Äôt deserve to be in a position to give yourself a million dollar bonus this year.Mmmm look at all that zucchini!Yup that‚Äôs the meal of heroes right thereMy wife's Hospital bought them Ice Cream sandwiches. I shit you not.I literally got better meals from barbecue days when I worked at a window factory.Resident physicians were specifically asked not to eat from the hospital appreciation lunch at my hospital this week and asked to take their food from the cafeteria elsewhere as the dining room was reserved for the ‚Äúappreciated staff‚Äù. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èLol the plate looks so sad.

CHEAP BASTARDSWe got slabs of unrecognizable burnt lasagna and a dry roll for ‚Äúlab appreciation week‚Äù last year as a thank you for being hero‚Äôs or whatever. \s\sAlso the whole hospital got a jet plane pootling over the building none of us could even see and traffic because the police decided to do a ‚Äúparade‚Äù around our building at shift change.r/mildlyinfuriatingWhat the fuck?Hopefully it comes with smellovision.This sort of thing reveals a larger problem with work today. If your employees are spending too much time idling in the restroom and the only way for you to realize it is to essentially use a tracking device... then maybe your employees don't have enough meaningful work to do? If they did you'd notice that they weren't getting it done long before you'd have to resort to tracking their bathroom usage. \s\sOtherwise this is just being petty over paying employees for their time instead of their work. Don't want employees to idle on ""your time""? Just pay them what their production is worth ffs. They'll be happier. They'll have more free time (unless they're very slow) and you won't have to worry about them taking moments to themselves as long as work is still getting done.Got one of these?  Use a powerful magnet to nuke any parts inside.  If it fails to open the door get a new one then keep the magnet at your desk so you can force them to give you a new one every day until they decide to just give you a low tech badge.  They cant punish you when they can't figure out what happened to their expensive badge.  Or you know ... find another job.Definitely. Non-visible destruction.\s\sFuck it build an electro-magnet just for killing the things if you have to. Claim it's a hobby and that it doesn't effect anything else in your house ""whoops guess your expensive bullshit tracking tool is broken!""Will it measure the distance travelled down a managers fucking throat when someone jams the pass down there?

They're 17 year olds who have never had a job beyond a paper route. They've also never had to give up any kind of luxury let alone basic needs or been fucking cold most likely.

The stores care more about upsetting mushrooms and onions more than your sells. I could have $1500 in sells but only 5% on loaded or smothereds (onions and mushrooms) and they would be annoyed that I couldn't upsell. I'm like I just brought you in $1500 in 5 hours is that not good enough. I left them after almost 10 years and the management has been telling people they fired me. I walked out in such a fashion that 3 months later they still talk about how great of a walk out it was.How did you walk out? I might want to copy youJust get a big ""8"" sticker and slap over that heart.I love free stuff even more when I don't have to spend my own money buying it but I have my limits.I'm not counting 15 pieces of flair.One of my Ex-Boyfriends took me to Texas Roadhouse on our first date and our relationship never really healed after that.O M G üëÄ this is so fff'd upFUCK THAT! And remember that being a server means that YOU the customer must pay HIS wage instead of his employer. I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it until my last day on earth FUCK TIPS! \s\sTip culture only exists in America I‚Äôve traveled the world and I don‚Äôt pay tips in restaurants. Why should I?

And snazzy earrings only count as 1 piece not 2!Happy cake dayWe're not in Kansas anymoreGlad this is top commentI thought the bare minimum was 10hr/weekWrong restaurant dude. I know I worked at one where we had to wear flair. While I thought it was stupid it didn't bother me to do so. Just like wearing this shirt wouldn't bother me as it's just part of the uniform. The purpose of that statement isn't for the employees it's an attempt to make the atmosphere more fun for the customers. Same reason servers at TR have to line dance to make it more fun for the guests. And that is the only reason I avoided applying there when I was looking for a serving job. I refuse to line dance and guess what? I didn't have to because I chose not to work there. It's super easy to avoid things you don't like since ya'll have choices.Can we be Karen‚Äôs and all email corporate with this pic telling them how ridiculous it is?Why would they wear a shirt that says they love their job if they don't love their job?They probably have to buy the shirt too.Perhaps not as dystopian as a cotton mask :)‚Ä¶perhaps not??that shirt is a red flag in and of itself. Even workaholics wouldn't run around with that slogan printed on their shirts.It‚Äôs just as dystopian to imagine someone ordering a *blue crush flavoured non-alcoholic lemonade* while eating at Texas Roadhouse.That's my 9-year-old's favorite drink lol.Our shirts used to say ‚Äúenjoy the hard work‚ÄùWe think for you you work for us. We decide for you you buy things from us. Disregard yourself for the betterment of us.I worked there and i fucking hated it.One of the best restaurants around.... please tell me they treat employees well..[deleted]Welcome to Texas Roadhouse. I love you.""Welcome to Costco; I love you.""Texas Roadhouse is about to open up location in my local area. I had a position as a server with them for the last two months. They open to the public on Monday (3/7/2022) and just fired me today (3/3/2022). They pulled me outside of the building today right after I showed up to training. They claimed other employees brought my negative comments about others and the food to their attention. They also mentioned that I had a conversation with one of the managers and the manager felt I had been rude to them. \s\sI never made any negative comments about anyone and kept to myself. That was a blatant lie. I enjoy more food there than I do other places because I'm a picky eater. I never made comments about the food that was also a lie. They kept us for 6-7 hour training sessions with no breaks or food for the first two days. They did have us sample dressings and the bread on the first day but it wasn't enough to make anyone feel content enough. They fed half of us the third day and the other half today. The point of this was to do crash course runs of how the restaurant should operate post opening. I ate yesterday but I was sincerely excited to show off my skills as a quick learning server today. I didn't get a chance too. They also brought up that I had an issue with one of the managers. The second night I told a specific manager I wanted to give away my  invitation for the Friends and Family event they are holding for the employees and some of the general public before the grand opening. She asked why didn't like my answer scoffed and jetted off. At the end of the third night I asked her if I could talk to her for a minute and she obliged. I apologized to her because I didn't think the question was rude/ignorant. She apologized to me and told me she respected me for apologizing. We spoke a little more about how the previous day had been stressful for everyone and we both understood the why things went awry in that moment. When I left my job at OG one of my service managers texted the general manager at this specific Texas Roadhouse telling him I had a bad attitude and that I walked out during the middle of my shift. This wasn't true. I have a great attitude nor was it the middle of my shift. None of my managers at OG liked me because I stood up for myself. When I saw other employees or managers mistreating a peer I stood up for them too. People don't like when you stand up for yourself or others. They see it as hostility because it isn't their way of thinking or they weren't the one to stand up. \s\sEither way the training was extremely cult-like and vomit inducing. No one there actually likes their job and they claim a TXRH store said they loved their jobs so much they suggested it. I'm willing to bet against it and say it's a corporate move.  Also This new TXRH location hired 240 people and 1/3 of them quit or got fired already. I can't speak for others but take it as you wish.I always hated that shirt. You aren't fooling anyone. Texas Roadhouse is constantly packed with lines out the door. It can't be a fun place to work.As a former employee I hated these shirts.....But at my location they're required to line dance every 30-ish minutes so that must be funA place like that is all about the people. I loved working at one when I was right out of high school. But it was mostly because the managers were decent people and a lot of the other staff was really fun to hang out with. But a few hard to work with team members or one bad manager can really ruin a fun work dynamic.When I worked at one back in the early 00s there was no dancing and no singing birthday songs. I did love my job back then. I've seen what Texas Roadhouse has become and it's to the point I can't even eat there anymore. Can't get through a single meal without having to hear a bunch of out-of-tune chain smokers screech a birthday song (that just starts a domino effect of customers suddenly remembering their birthday is in five months and demand another round of singing).It is if you like earning a decent living from tips.When I work there I did at one time have managers that were wonderful and made it fun to work. When we switch markets to one where most of the stores were in richer and/or more tourists driven area that's when things got bad. They would compare us to them and our management would get mad because we were keeping up with other stores. We were like we can't compete with stores that have our top shelf drinks as their bottom shelf. We are in an area with poorer old people compare to the rich areas of South florida.It‚Äôs just a uniform lol. You all look way to deep into this stuff. I‚Äôd be happy to get to wear some casual comfy tshirt to work.It‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs really really fun and fulfilling. I have hated going to any other job. The pay and the schedule are shit.And their food is godawful.

Would you rather be clearing $300+ in cash in a shift vs. a dead shift at cheddar‚Äôs where you made $4 off the 2 tables that came in?I'll never understand why Texas Roadhouse is busy. The food is awful.No one is paying you to complain wageslave. now get me my coffee.Yes master right away.I have always thought this was bizarreWorked at a printing place that produced a lot of stuff for Texas Roadhouse.  We always joked about this slogan and saying there probably weren't very many people that it applied to.Idk about dystopian LOLyou took a photo of this worker without permission wtfIt makes me so sad that Guillermo from WWDITS has to work at Texas Roadhouse. The familiar biz ain't what it used to be.Fucking guyyyyyyyyCouldn‚Äôt get back into Panera I guess.I worked that job as a host. That‚Äôs the only way you can become a server there unless you have countless years of experience.\s\sThey used to crap on me about not smiling enough and not engaging the customers enough. \s\sThen they crapped on me for ‚Äúbeing too chatty‚Äù and not reiterating the fucking cult-like chant of ‚Äúfall off the bone ribs made from scratch sides and salads ice cold margaritas‚Ä¶‚Äù\s\sThen they crapped on me for being too robotic because in the three seconds it takes to seat someone you can‚Äôt rattle out the company motto AND talk about their cats and dogs and the weather and‚Ä¶\s\sThen they crapped on me for seating people in the wrong place.\s\s\sThen they crapped on me for ‚Äúbeing too quiet‚Äù because sometimes I had to focus on finding Table 27EB8 in area 3 row x column z while juggling the motto and their life story‚Ä¶\s\sI was 15 when I worked there.

First job first write up. She wrote me up for laughing. My dad was my ride and he kept calling me. I broke out my phone in the office to text him back to let him know I was going to be a little late after my shift. The manager wrote me up for that too. I didn‚Äôt know until she gleefully handed over three write-up slips described each one in a chirpy tone as if they were photos from a family vacation and told me my ‚Äúcheck would be in the mail‚Äù with not a smile but a beaming grin.I hope she felt powerful doing that. Those write ups mean nothing in the long run.Worked there for 7 years. You aren't forced to wear that shirt. Also it's an amazing company. The guests are the hard part about that job. Genuinely a company that cares about their employees.DYSTOPIANyeah I've worked 20+ jobs in my life and roadhouse was actually a decent job I remember fondly.I go there all the time because the employees seem really happy.There is not a single company in the world that cares about their employees. \s\s\sExceptions include worker cooperatives and a few others.I‚Äôm sure some of these shirts can be found at the local Goodwill.It rubs the butter on its skin or else it gets the hose againWorst part about it is you also have to wear a smile.""I happen to notice you only have 15 pieces of flair Joanna...""I worked at Texas Roadhouse for awhile it fucking sucked I was 16 and no other job he yelled at me more than that place one of the managers called me worthless because I couldn‚Äôt sweep fast enough for her I had my schedule change constantly on the day where instead of leaving at 8 I‚Äôd leave at 1 I never complained because it was my first job and I didn‚Äôt know better[Long Blink]  \s[Long Blink] [Long Blink] [Long Blink]   \s[Blink] [Long Blink] [Blink]  \s[Long Blink]  \s[Blink] [Blink] [Long Blink]  \s[Blink] [Long Blink] [Blink]  \s[Blink]Them having to perform line dancing every hour or so is like that too.Same way @ Lone Star.

The heart looks like it's straight out of a bad rom-comThis isn‚Äôt relevant to the insulting uniform at Texas Roadhouse but last time I went there they were out of ribeye at like 6pm. How? You‚Äôre a steakhouse. Haven‚Äôt gone back since especially since making my own honey cinnamon butterI would certainly love my job more if I got paid an appropriate wage got PTO sick leave benefits including vision and dental and was a member of a union. Otherwise fuck you and your shirt.Imagine seeing the back of that shirt in the kitchen giving you the goatr/idontdreamoflaborDamn I do love their rollsThat would be like having them force you to smile with straps or something. I‚Äôm just gonna have to wear a shitty red vestThat‚Äôs horrible!  And creepy.The sad part is is that they‚Äôve been forcing their employees to wear those for at least 15+ years.There was a brew pub I worked at briefly that had ""I'd tap that"" on the back of the shirt with a picture of a keg. It's cheeky until its someone's work shirt. Fortunately there were other options but I cringed at the very sight of that shirt every time. It was an open invitation to creep on the staff.Honestly it's the closest word to ""hate"" and now it makes sense.[removed]> Also a big fuck you to Mary Snare in Boise Idaho - for telling me in front of everyone that I was an awful worker - because I took time off for my brother's funeral in November of 2020.\s> \s> When my mom died on Christmas Day of 2020 Texas Roadhouse just straight up fired me.\s\sShe's lucky you didn't snap.Former roadie can confirm. Also our store consistently had people calling off so to prevent being short handed they would schedule 3 extra servers per shift on top of the 25 already scheduled but wouldn‚Äôt give them a section so you would show up just to be sent home if no one happened to call off that day.

I've never heard of one that punishes you for not selling something. Not at a restaurant at least heard some things about fast food.This is either way over exaggerated or you worked at a horrible Texas Roadhouse. I love my job as a server there.another thing that should be illegal. \s\si shouldn‚Äôt be forced to lie or express my opinion at all. \s\sthey‚Äôre using their employees as walking billboards to promote their work environment regardless of what they might actually think. \s\sdisgusting to say the least.I love my Serfdom!I'm sorry but who at corporate actually believes those workers ""love their job""? If it's so f\*cking great I want to see all of corporate working there each week for 40 hours a week in the kitchen and waiting tables and then after 6 months see if they still ""love their job"".Even knowing the company means for it to be sincere I can't help but read this just absolutely DRIPPING in sarcasm.Or you see your waitress who you just asked something from is now stuck in an effin line dance that she doesn't want to do again.If it says so on the shirt it must be trueIt‚Äôs just a shirt thoughI have asked them about that. The answers I get are less than enthusiastic. Just like everybody else they do what they have to do.Worked at Roadhouses for 3 years. Yes we pretty much are forced to. You forget it's on your back all the time besides the few instances where a customer will point it out to you. It catches you off guard for the second it takes to truly realize you're wearing this but at the time I really did love my job (16 busser and naive) and customers genuinely did not believe me. They usually dismissed it as ""oh they probably make you say that"". \s\s\s\s\sWhich granted they don't. But as the years when by and I became a server it became ever increasingly embarrassing whenever it got point out and I was reminded of it.I'm just waiting for the mandatory smile face tattoos.Job = double plus good.Imagine a mad lad that manipulates the heart to read the word ""do"". Or better ""hate."" That would probably be harder though.I have the exact opposite of that T-shirt in my drawer. Sadly it shrunk in the laundry.Don't work there then""We need to have a talk about your flair.""""Welcome to Costco I love you."" -Future GreeterI worked at Walmart for almost 6 years about 2 years in they gave us those fucking vest that said ""Proud Walmart Associate"" I fucking hated that. I wasn't ashamed of working there but I was far from proud of it. I hated feeling like I was being used as part of their propaganda machine.I covered the ""ociate"" part of associate with a pin when i worked there. I don't think anyone noticed other than me. But it made it bearable.You wouldn‚Äôt wanna have to talk to our Human Resources department would ya squiddy?Worked at one over a summer a few years back. Wasn't too bad as far as serving gigs go (i mean still made 2.13/hr + tips etc.). HOWEVER those dances you see the servers do during service? Yeah never trained me on those. 3 weeks of training with time before people were let in. Not one time did they say ""this song do these steps"" -- honestly that tanked my tips pretty hard because I'd sort of stand there and try. Fuck you TR![deleted]I find that dancing thing so demeaning. And who is it for? \s\sDo kids like it? Drunk people?I don‚Äôt wear short sleeves.

Fuck you AmyYep masks are a bitch aren't they? Oh we're talking about the shirt? Ah okay. I guess it's only okay for companies to Mandate things to cover up people's face. Turning them into a faceless figure.If my employer asked me to wear that shirt or not be employed I'd find employment elsewhereI‚Äôve developed a habit of rejecting everything free offered at my job. No branded shirts no snack sized candy I don‚Äôt even eat their  pizza anymore.Part of their soul dies every time they put this shirt on.yesss i love my boss who pays me 5 quid an hour to work a really hard job that ruins my health yesss queen :drool:It should say ""I ‚ù§ the rolls""Lmfao I don‚Äôt think they gafIf you have to go around telling people you love your job you don‚Äôt love your job.Like those ""I love my wife"" bumper stickers translate to ""I love gloryholes""This place fucking sucked to work at.I love my job.

Also all the peanut dustEvery time I go to Texas roadhouse I receive great service from all the staff I have contact with and they all seem happy and motivated.  I don't see why they wouldn't want to wear the shirt. I also make sure to leave a good tip for the waiters.Then stop eating there.I bet he is a liar üòÇAll employees are forced to wear this and I can definitely tell you they do not love their jobs. We all gotta make money though even if it means crushing our souls and spirit for a couple of warms rolls with cinnamon butter.I have thought this as well.Its on a t-shirt it must be true.Yo i was at the one in Tracy California and they have a bunch of confederate flags and blue lives matter shit on the wall. What‚Äôs crazy is they got Hispanics whipping it up in the kitchen and a few African American waitresses. Mind blowing!Doing the song and dance is optional.

I'd quit for sure.I always hated wearing that shirt and the hierarchy they had set there. Depending on what position you were in you were either treated with some respect or they let you drown in your work with no help or back up.Imagine a CEO wearing this.I‚Äôd wear it and mean it if I were making $26M plus stock options‚Ä¶ (actually probably not; I hate exploiting people so couldn‚Äôt do it with a good conscious)Dumb.

Refused to wear that shirt after I got a no-no talk after a guest asked me if I ""loved my job"" which was responded with an obvious response.Yep worked there for 10 years as a meat cutter. I always hated those shirts.\sEspecially whenever the district managers be pulling up in f150 raptors and twlling us to be legendary.\sMeanwhile half of the workers have to take the bus to work because they can't afford a car.\sThat place puts on a facade that they care about their employees.You cut meat for 10 years? That sounds fascinatingly boring.The power of positive thought! I‚Äôm glad someone at my work tore down the 20 propaganda positive message posters at my work. They irritated me.Reminds me of an old mcdonalds hiring poster.  ""Dont you want a job that makes you smile?""Fun fact. You have to buy those shirts. You have to pay for the 'honor' of 'loving your job'.\s\sDystopia is an understatement. I know I worked there.  Got employee of the month. Got a plaque.  Do not recommend.Reminds me of that scene in SpongeBob where they take over the Krusty Krab and turn into a cookie cutter sit down restaurant like Apple BeesI worked there when I was 17... and the shirts were free. Came with the uniform. Where the hell did you have to pay for your work uniform ?No you don‚Äôt they give them to you. You can buy extras if you want but the only time I‚Äôve ever had to pay for one is if I wanted a long sleeve one.That‚Äôs illegal. They have to supply uniforms.No you don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a lie. Y‚Äôall are crazy in here man finding any reason to shit on TXRH>You have to buy those shirts.\s\sBullshit.I would love in retaliation they cross out My and add BlowWelcome to Costco I love you.Which membership tier is this? I need some love in bulk.If you have one bucket that contains 2 gallons and another bucket that contains 7 gallons how many buckets do you have?I had some old lady snap at me cuz it was my first time. Instead of telling me about where to go for membership and stuff she started getting aggressive for me to leave.Ah.....College....Idiocracy is too much to ask for. At least they could afford houses.I ate there just was Sunday thought the exact same thing.Yup used to work there. If you still work there now it means you aren't dealing with the problems in your life it could be different store to store but the one I worked at existed solely off of predating people who didn't know their worth[deleted]I had to wear these lol. We got other shirts on holidays that didn't say I ‚ù§Ô∏è my job so I usually wore those year round.\s\sOccasionally I'd have tables ask ""do you really love your job?"" The first few times I fed them the company line but after 6 months of exploitation I told them straight up ""no it sucks and the mac and cheese comes in a microwave pouch.""At least it's Kraft thoSpill the secrets! I love that place what should we know about it?What‚Äôs the company line?Fight club members should modify their shirts a lil but keep the design so management doesn‚Äôt know like I ‚ù§Ô∏è my efeen jobYes and 16 year old girls are made to line dance and shimmy. You have no choice. I worked here for a total of 5-6 years in the kitchen and as a hostess. Men aren't allowed to have earrings or long hair. Oh and the management is putrid. As a small female I had my ass groped by an old man when I was 16 we HAD to wear tight jeans with the shirt tucked in. I would regularly hide in the bathroom in panic particularly to avoid the line dances and getting stared at by creepy old men. Shit disgusts me. The kitchen was much better and I got along with everyone but they negligently underpay and try to hire as many immigrants as possible because they get a tax write off for each one as well as having to pay them less. The owner of my store was so god damn greedy and refused to replace anything. In the heat of the summer the kitchen would get to 115¬∞F sending a few people to the ER. We all called OSHA and HR. Did they replace the AC? Of course not they had us all sign a piece of paper saying we know the symptoms of heat strokeUsed to work there and can confirm it was horrendous. Not to mention all the customer comments. Most snarky some pityingIt's disgusting.Sounds like your assuming too much dude just wearing a shirt to work not everything has to be a slight to workerI liked it for a day because it was a new experience for me. I've always wanted to work at a restaurant and I picked up a bus boy position. We were understaffed servers were quitting left and right. They never hired any new servers or bussers since the time I got there.\s\sAt out place we were supposed to have 3 bussers for closing. One would leave at about 11 and the other 2 would clean the area and leave at 12. It was just me and one other guy bussing a whole restaurant that was for some reason packed on a Monday at night. We ended up leaving at 1:30 or so. \s\sI ended up quitting at my 1 month mark. Tip share was nice after 1 month I made an extra 1k on top of my regular pay but it was not worth it. Horrible job. Since working there I always try to the best of my ability to clean any table I use at a restaurant to help lighten the load. I was always appreciative when people did that for me.Going to have to take a happy mask soonIt‚Äôs just to make it more appealing to the customer would you want to eat somewhere where everyone is miserable and obviously hates their job?Anyone with common sense knows that any restaurant employee no matter the restaurant is a miserable work environment.This is like that scene from game of thrones before it sucked.  ""Any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king.""  If I see this I automatically assume its so bad you had to literally put this shit everywhere because its the exact opposite.Welcome to Costco‚Ä¶.I love youA simple fix for this.

We're halfway there with involuntary detainment.Oh we finally found the meaning of life!Money is the meaning to life for real. And if you don't believe me just stop paying your bills and see where life takes you.[A post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/d2ta5e/why_is_suicide_viewed_so_terribly_in_society/ezxktvp/) I wrote in response to a thread asking why suicide was so taboo in our society. The ways in which the money maximizing machine converges with exploiting the individual here are fundamental because the very first step to exploitation is forcing everyone who is so miserable they beg for death a denial of this very basic right.\s\sThe incentives here are plain: Pharmaceuticals like antidepressants simply aren't profitable if people are allowed to die. The drugs are intended to prevent death so they maximize profit in two ways causing a feedback loop for profit. They prevent the death of the consumer and then this allows the consumer to consume more of the product which prevents their death which allows for yet more consumption. **Crucially they allow you to wake up get out of bed in the morning and work conditions which you would otherwise consider to be unbearable without the presence of many of these drugs.**(and many times even with their presence-- you can only sprinkle so much glitter on a turd) This class of drugs have a kind of ""meta-profit"" for all other industries because as a CEO of a major corporation you inadvertently benefit from your depressed ground floor being on drugs whether you're in the pharmaceuticals business or not.\s\sJust imagine this with any other destructive industry based on killing the consumer for profits: Imagine if eating Big Macs and milkshakes at MacDonald's actually *lowered* your chances of dying from a heart attack or diabetes. Imagine if you had to ""give the Big Macs a chance"" for a few months before they started working. Imagine if McDonalds told everyone it was imperative to not die no matter what because life is precious or people who want to die in a mentally ill system are somehow psychologically impaired. \s\sThis is our situation with Big Pharma.It just shows if you're worth that much alive and you're not receiving that much you are getting fucked by your employer.The average full-time salary in the UK is ¬£36611 yet according to this they produce ¬£1.7 million.50 years multiplied by 36k equals 1.8M so it sounds approximately correct to me.Nebraska has an anti suicide campaign that does the same thing. It calculates the opportunity cost of every death. Most people are valued at around $2 million.The obvious solution is to pay workers more. But no it's too profitable to shove suicidal people into mental health wards in the U.S. and possibly ship them to New York City or San FranciscoThis is sick. She's giving you that condescending don't you steal from us asshole! look.I can't wait for Amazon to release a missive saying that suicide is 'long-term time theft'.   \s\s\sMaybe one day in the future companies will be able to claim back job-training costs from the estates of employees who've committed suicide.As if staying a monkey of a fucked up system gives you any reason to live.

Of course they want developing countries to destroy their resourcesForest only provide us with clean air prevent the erosion of the soil regulate the temperature provide a home for countless animals clean thr aquifers clean and give us a beautiful landscape... \s\s\s**BUT THEY'RE NOT MAKING MONEY!!!!!!**F the world bank!!It's of course telling that the World Bank uses a bullshit metric (GDP) as its argument and nary a mention of humanity. But GDP is of course the be-all end-all and clean air doesn't contribute to GDP. And a family chopping a tree down for firewood doesn't count as ""utilization"" because it's not part of GDP. Or for housing materials. Or bookshelves. Or a table. If it's not sold it doesn't count.\s\sBlow it out your ear World Bank. Get your Keynesian head out of your Austrian School ass and stop thinking of economics as a science extrinsic of real humanity.I can‚Äôt wait until our relentless pursuit of economic growth has consumed every last natural resource and all that‚Äôs left is strip malls McMansions and parking lots. It‚Äôs like a wondrous tumor of wealth creation.>It looked pretty good. It was pristine. Paradise. Have you seen it lately? Have you taken a good look at it lately? It‚Äôs fucking embarrassing.\s\s>Only a nation of unenlightened half-wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today a shopping mall. A big fucking shopping mall. You know that. That‚Äôs all you got. That‚Äôs all you got here folks. Mile after mile of mall after mall. Many many malls. Major malls and mini malls. They put the mini malls in between the major malls. And in between the mini malls they put the mini marts. And in between the mini marts. You‚Äôve got the car lots gas stations muffler shops Laundromats cheap hotels fast food joints strip clubs and dirty bookstores. America the beautiful. One big transcontinental commercial cesspool.\s\s>And how do the people feel about all this? How do the people feel about living in a coast-to-coast shopping mall? Well they think it‚Äôs JUST FUCKING DANDY!\s\s - George CarlinIt will be a sad monument to our extinction that our concrete creations are all that is left standing on a dead planet. Even that will eventually give into the ravages of time and be reduced to dust.[deleted]Yeah when these people will realize money is not edible.When the Last Tree Is Cut Down the Last Fish Eaten and the Last Stream Poisoned You Will Realize That You Cannot Eat Money\s\sAlanis ObomsawinThere are some collapse subreddits you may like71% forest land seems pretty sustainable to me.I'm a bit torn on this issue. It's possible to do this sustainably but not without proper regulation. i.e. you at least plant what you fell and even then it's not quite so straightforward. \s\sTrees are renewable and with proper processing you can make sustainable housing and sure furniture as well - but again that requires proper regulation. \s\sNow The World Bank can go fuck itself. The primary motivator here isn't to increase the proportion of Bhutan's forest industry in its GDP. If it's possible to sustainably fell trees and plant new ones as a means for ecological diversity and as a carbon sink calculation that's the approach that can be explored and even then you'd have a hard time arguing the science behind it. \s\sBut destroying half your country's forests and building a McD's parking lot in its stead so that next year you can double your forests' proportion of your GDP from 2% to 4% is laughable. Not to even mention that after you've cleared out half of your forests you've now set the bar for your forest industry's GDP proportion at 4% and you only have a quarter of raw material to work with compared to the beginning of the previous year.\s\sSo yeah actually: ""How can the country sustainably invest in its forests?""\s\sAnswer: ""By not involving The World Bank.""Old-growth forests are not replaceable. Cutting down trees and then planting the same number of trees is not the same as not cutting any trees in the first place. Old-growth forests require trees and a very long time. They have a very balanced ecology and the animal species is dependent on that forest.What does the article actually say? What is their idea for sustainably investing in forests? Nobody here's actually referenced their argumentThree ideas:\s\s- Plant a few more trees anyway\s\s- Refuse visas to people from World Bank South Asia and its peers\s\s- Create teaching programs to help other societies increase their forestsBanks are the worst. They do nothing but always profit.Again people are not so informed. Bhutan survives on handouts from neighbours. Education and healthcare is a joke. No infrastructure. There are no work opportunities. The absolute power lies with the King. \s\sIt's not a successful state it serves as a buffer nation so both neighboring countries keep it happy. It's not sustainable. \s\sNot to mention that their system of government is the definition of dictatorship. People have no rights. There are no political parties. \s\sIt's not a successful model of government except for some fringe politigram pages. \s\sTheir system of government is known as Eco-fascism.I doubt cutting down their old growth forests will fix any of those problems long term. Maybe temporary job growth.Well they're maybe a failed country but they're doing one thing right and the rest of the world consider it a failure as well. We can continue to defend our ""western"" democracies but for the moment if we continue to defend them as we do in 30 years the planet will be in a catastrophic state so who knows? Being an ""enlightened"" country in a dead world won't matter a lot.As of 2008 Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy with a parliament and universal suffrage and at least two political parties. Their economy is growing and while it is true their biggest trading partner is India they have no trade or relationship with China. The current king who can be impeached by their parliament continues to push for reforms and modernization. Most of it's exponential economic growth (Bhutan is one of the fastest growing economies in the world) ver the last thirty years has come from energy and tourism and more recently technology.\s\sBhutan isn't a failed state but a once former extremely isolated one slowly modernizing and opening up to the outside world. One that doesn't buy into the rest of the world's ideas that power and wealth are all there is to life.\s\s(EDIT: typos)Hell even eco-fascism would have forest harvesting because they know using oil products is even worse.It's already being used sustainably in a very important process called ""breathing."" Guess the world bank needs to learn basic biology.It seems they've since deleted the post go figure.""how can they sustain?""\s\sBruh moment.Fuck moneyHoly shit. Bankers suck even worse than I thought.I had the privilege of visiting Bhutan legit one of the best experiences of my life.\s\sFor reference: I've not moved away from my home city traveled a LOT but never wanted to live somewhere else - was always to scared of trying to make it in a city I didn't know anyone else in. \s\sAfter my 1.5 week visit to Bhutan I tried to move there. They're extremely strict about immigration I had a potential job lined up even but they wanted to reserve work opportunities for citizens which makes sense. \s\s**if they try to pull some shit and get their hands on the national reserves of forests and lands I'm going to fucking war. They've got it in their God dammed constitution that 70% of the country must remain forests ffs CAPITALISTS BE WARNED.**>They've got it in their God dammed constitution that 70% of the country must remain forests ffs CAPITALISTS BE WARNED.\s\sWhy do I have this sickening feeling that in 5-10 years we are gonna hear about some coup or civil war that leads to a change of government that disregards their constitution and is secretly installed by foreign capitalistic powers to start destroying their forests for profits.....I'd absolutely love to visit and potentially move to Bhutan. A country that puts its people and land above economic growth? Yes please.Damn you paid 200$ to stay there each day? It was free for me as I was Indian but damn the white folks that were there were Rich Ol‚Äô Rich.As someone who is using all my power and resources to leave the US permanently I definitely understand wanting to reserve jobs for their current citizens... I‚Äôm just sad because I didn‚Äôt choose to be born in the US ya know? SighhhhThey could still keep the 70% limit and use only a portion of their forest resources for sustainable timber production. It's not going to replace any old growth forests but the usual method is to harvest the trees in an area reseed with new trees and then rotate to a new area while the previous one grows back. It obviously has some ecological impact on the plants and animals that live in those areas but the impact can be limited by finding the least diverse and populated forests. An upside is that now Bhutan would have more income that could be devoted to more conservation efforts and to enrich the lives of it's people. The use of wood isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Things made from wood have less carbon footprint than things made from metals concrete or plastics. Until there is some major event that causes a significant population decrease people are going to need resources to survive and all we can do at this point is use resources that cause the least harm to the earth.Glad you enjoyed it. My mother‚Äôs from Bhutan and it is a beautiful experience every time I get to visit. There‚Äôs no place like it.""The forest sector remains underutilized"" is possibly the most dystopian sentence I have ever read.[deleted]And then profit $$$$ \s\sGotta make 3 generations of wealth guys!!I mean not necessarily. There are some relatively low impact things that can be done to generate profits without fucking over anything. \s\sIt's just most investing institutions are ***unethical fucks*** who don't give a shit about damning the world if they make a slightly large profit.\s\sFor example changes in forest management are likely needed to control wildfire lands already. Perhaps selling carbon credit offsets by lemongrass growers who abandon theri use of fire to cultivate land.Whats tourism like there? This makes me want to go visitYears from now even those that advocated logging will look back and think: why did we log old growth forests - they are such a wealth of opportunity in terms of science medicine tourism health and well being etc.? It doesnt make sense to turn it into lumber.It's kinda like when Optimus Prime tried to explain to the Dinobot Grimlock that Megatron was trying to destroy the Earth. Grimlock says ""Me no care about stupid Earth"". Optimus says ""Dude we're standing on Earth""! Grimlock: ""Uhh.....""I have some nuts they are welcome to play with.‚ÄúRemains underutilized‚Äù.... for what exactly?? MFs pretending the whole fucking world doesn‚Äôt utilize those trees for fuckin AIR habitats for OTHER SPECIES WITH WHICH WE *SHARE* THE WORLDDo y'all not realize that sustainable logging and forestry are a thing?  \s\sThe US lumber industry actually plants and [grows more trees per year than it harvests](https://twosidesna.org/paper-production-supports-sustainable-forest-management/).Hey I was lectured by this guy he had some really interesting insights about the global south.It's funny because 'invest in their forests' is codespeak for 'destroy their forests'.Is anyone familiar with various low impact silvicultural practices that could be carried out in these forests? There's many approaches and none of them involve raping and pillaging the landscape. Simply taking it into some level of management for the betterment of local peopleDisgustingThe World Bank IMF and other such organizations are amazingly evil. That they get people defending them is just stupid.Bhutan has been taken by Israel. Say bye bye to the trees.There are WAY TO MANY people on this planet... Hence CovidNo just too many greedy idiots Covid is doing next to nothing to slow that down... People stayed home for a little bit a positive environmental impact or at least less negative. 99% + survival rate the only thing its really done is allow the rich to get richer. Earth can support a lot more people if we did it right but that's not in the interest of the ruling class. So this kind of thinking is encouraged as well as Industrial growth the byproduct of which is toxic then they get you one the other end and sell you temporary relief in all its forms. Just stop buying into it all of it. That's the only real solution here. Those little slips with the dead white guys on it are votes the only ones that really count so spend wisely. Also quit your shitty job that does nothing than add to the problem.Look at those lazy trees! Just standing there contributing NOTHING to this countries GDP! Next thing you tell me is that they don't even pay TAXES??!! The world is missing out on valuable CONSUMER GOODS and every acre of untouched nature will be held directly accountable for every dollar this country is in DEBT!!!A tree is more valuable dead.\s\sA whale is more valuable dead.\s\sA human is more valuable subdued and basically dead (slavery.)\s\sCapitalism NEEDS to be destroyed.In New York State the Adirondack and Catskill forrests are fully protected from development.

Do you not realize that the average consumer is responsible for this? You me most of us in ""developed"" countries.  Stop buying wood and paper if it bothers you so much.  Focusing on logging is a bad hill to die on as it can be sustainable if properly managed.  But then again this is antiwork.  Can't expect you guys to follow voluntarist principles.I guess that guy doesn't know what the word ""sustainable"" meansWorld Bank: ‚ÄúWhat about them? They‚Äôre freshhh‚Äùthey get paid carbon credits for the forests?And then I got mad. \s\sI got terribly mad. \s\sI yelled at the Lorax Now listen here Dad! \s\sAll you do is yap-yap and say Bad! Bad!

A forest is a forest it does not exist for humans to ""utilize"" and we have no obligation to do so.Bhutan is pretty isolated. I'm starting to see why.Sustainably utilizeNow I want to travel to bhutan. The country could be a legit hippie paradise.Travel to the Kingdom of Bhutan is highly regulated under the policy ""High Value Low Impact Tourism"" in order to minimize the impact on the country's unique society and environment. Bhutanese policy ensures that only a limited number of tourists enter the country at any one time preventing it from being overwhelmed by mass tourism and thus altering its character and that the tourists who do come get the most out of their visits.you gotta pay $250 each day there unless you‚Äôre Indian. They‚Äôre trying their best to not make it a hippie paradise.No not really. \s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_BhutanOn the upside: due to this tweet I now know that Bhutan is carbon negative which is nice.TIL Bhutan is a badass.TIL there‚Äôs a country called BhutanTranslation ""WE'RE NOT EXPLOITING HARD ENOUGH""They can‚Äôt commodify oxygen until they destroy all the forests first.Capitalism is a virusDamn I need go get me a [BHUTANESE PASSPOOOooooooooort](https://youtu.be/QdDD9ViRZz4) ASAPI'm sure they're talking about forest tours for locals and tourists... not deforestation right?If World Bank South Asia wants to plant and harvest sustainable groves I bet Pakistan would be happy to lease them hella acres of the Thar'sustainably invest' is double speak for seize destroy and funnel profits into tax havensThat they picked Bhutan home of the idea ‚ÄúGross Domestic Happiness‚Äù. Shakin my headAlso home of the idea of ‚Äúethnically cleansed our nation of the Lhotshampa people‚Äù. The tweet here is shit but let‚Äôs not counterjerk too hard.Fuc* world bank and their economic assasins.Isnt it in their constitution that 70% of their country has to remain forest?It's one thing to think ""eh this forest can withstand maybe two tons (arbitrary number made up by me) of resource extraction per year before the reproduction of trees can't keep up."" But no let's just full throttle a fucking forest for everything it's worth. The sooner the trees are gone the sooner we can drag minerals and oil out too.The tweet does say ""sustainably"". Whether they mean it is another matter.Does anyone know when the western power backed coup is scheduled for? Surely those forests need to be ""liberated"".As a prior forestry guy I agree with cutting trees but this has more to do with replanting the earth than leveling it.\s\sWe have failed to enforce mandatory replanting all over the developed world and have in my opinion ruined our ecosystem because of it.\s\sWe are all up in arms about Brazil cutting but we haven't let our tree farms grow beyond 45 years for 100 years. We need old growth forest projects every other timber plot. We need a major cutback on consumption and more forest maintenance.\s\sIts a world the corporations do not have time for. Money is really the biggest killer of this planet. \s\sSounds like Bhutan should be an old growth conservation point and we should stay the fuck out of there.\s\sThere is no reason half the forests shouldn't be mandatory never cut and half the harvested forests should grow 300 years or more before harvest.\s\sFuck then we also need to stop using plastics. The world is so fucked.What does this have to do with disliking work? Seems like there is something else going on in this subreddit.\s\sand what position are you in telling poor people in developing countries that they should not work and should not create wealth from their resources?We need to maintain any intact regional ecosystems we have left on earth to survive more than another couple generations as a species.‚ÄòInvest‚Äô is a good term for take over and tear down...I know Bhutan is expensive to go because of their tourist tax designed to discourage mass visitors ‚Ä¶ but I still wanna go.As the old myth states a vampire must ask permission to enter your premises.  The world bank is a vampire and so never let them in.  Otherwise your entire country will have do more than chop down trees to pay them back.I like to think that George Carlin if he were still with us would remind us of the slippery slope that occurs when ‚Äúthe forest‚Äù becomes ‚Äúthe forest sector.‚Äù""Noooo you can't just keep your forest sector underutilized how will you contribute to the economyyyyy!""\s\s""Haha trees go wheeee""‚ÄúUnderutilized?‚Äùor ‚Äúallowed to continue existing ‚Äú?The language these soulless ghouls use‚ÄúSustainably invest‚Äù\s\sA big joke.Underutilized? It makes oxygeni see bhutan all the time when i play geoguessr the forests are beautifulWe deserve to go extinctLooks like someone needs freedom like ASAPlmao but it‚Äôs a fun situation to think of since Bhutan is a protectorate of India.Fucking trees how dare they just stand there waste so much area that could be turned into money-making factories and get turned into wood what even do they do? Create oxygen? Who the fuck needs it when we have MONIEZZZZEven worse those trees are providing oxygen for free. Fucking communist trees.Those darn trees wasting carbon dioxide.What's worse is the big thing trees do for us is trap carbon.  A lot of these immoral companies will set fire to the forests they are trying to take over in order to clear them out for farm land or whatever else they were wanting.  That puts a lot of the carbon back into the air.What‚Äôs sad is that this is actually some people‚Äôs thought process.Bhutan is poor af so it isn‚Äôt exactly helping the local population.\s\sForestry done right is actually pretty helpful for the environmentThey have removed the tweet since though. I guess it affected the sustainability of their investors.God forbid if we didnt just monetize every fucking thing! /SEat. Your.

Yeah and you wonder why I'm avoiding you?If my boss called me at 830 am on a sunday and was suitably apologetic and offered an appropriate boost in compensation (say 2.5 or 3x my hourly rate) along with a decent explanation of why such short notice I would go in.Why is America such a fuckdumb country?I don't think it is just americaI had a job where my boss would message me 2-3 hours before my shift to ask me to come in which was fine in the school holidays bc i wasnt busy and we had agreed to do it like that. I also got fired though.So what job was this?I once invented a girlfriend who I used to 'visit' out of town on my days off.Not like it was their business anyways what you were doing ok your days off. Still genius idea! :)This or ‚ÄùI have school‚Äù ‚ÄùI‚Äôm out of town visiting my grandma‚Äù. Anything but ‚Äùno I dont want to.‚Äùsmart manAh yes along those lines I used to ""share my car"" so I was never able to stay late.\s\s I briefly worked a night shift and was supposed to get out at 7am they would frequently try and keep me until 10am.Benefit of working two jobs is I can always say I'm working my other job when either one asks me to deviate from the schedule I set in any way whatsoever.I‚Äôve had about 4 grandfathers dieThat's so out of pocket. Most people are asleep at 3:30 in the morning I could see if it was maybe halfway through the say and he texted you but in the middle of the night when most people are sleeping. What did he expect?Capitalism gives zero fucks about your sleep times buddy. Work or die. WOrk and then die. ALl the same...Assuming he starts at 9/10 does the boss asshole sleep?Murica in a nutshellI will text this guy right now and tell him to hoop his fuckin helmetWhat does that mean??Yeah my boss always did shit like that. But she also did the opposite  calling 9:30 so I wont go to my 10:00 shift. Bitch  I haven't done anything last night so I would be rested for work and I woke up 8:00 to get ready. You bet your ass I am coming in.You could have said noYour boss is a cunt\s\sEdit: ex boss apparently. Sorry OP. It is probably for the best though I hope you find employment somewhere that appreciates you!We'd appreciate it if you didn't use misogynistic language.\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

Your boss that is.that‚Äôs so unprofessional of him this is some shit id expect from like a small shitty cafe not a job where you‚Äôre expected to do manual labour! good on you for standing up for yourself!Hey fuck you I‚Äôve worked at ‚Äúsmall shitty cafe‚Äù type places and their employees aren‚Äôt any less deserving of basic human decency than any others.SueHappened to me once\s\sI was awake at 4AM when i received the message  told them ""ok sure i will be there on time""\s\sNext day i never showed up on purpose  ignored all the bosses calls and call him to say I'm quitting 3 hours after i was supposed to be at work\s\sIf he wants to give delayed calls he will receive delayed calls""I wanted you to.."" as if there is no separation of you from his will. The exploiting class has been so glutted on the world responding to their will they've reach almost schizophrenic heights.Yes how dare he defy the will of the puppet master... Id be willing to bet there are consequences for this ‚Äòdefiance‚Äô as well. \s\sSickening.[deleted]This is the craziest part or the whole ordeal the wording is like it‚Äôs something that is expected of you.I've just read your post on legal advice. It's ridiculous that it's not illegal for your boss to change your schedule with such short notice let alone without your consent! Unionize! What do you do for a livingLmfao that shit wouldnt even get a response fuck right off with thatI don‚Äôt condone violence but man this guy definitely influences itWow. My old boss used to do stuff like this calling me at 5 am on my off days. She would ask me to come in at like 7 am because the morning shift person didn‚Äôt show up. I never answered but she would blow up my phone with texts like ‚Äúplease respond‚Äù ‚Äúhello?‚Äù and ‚Äú üëÄ‚Äù I‚Äôm so glad I got away from there.She would actually use the eye emoji? WowWow. It amazes me how people like that can assume that their employees will bend to their will and somehow it's the employee's fault if they don't agree to it.My last employer did this shit to me too. \s\sGenuine question though what is their alternative? To employ more people than they need?Don't know how anyone can look at this and be like yeah the free market is greatThis happens at my work because management is in a foreign country with a significant time difference. Other than that (which is still annoying) this is absolutely ridiculous. I will sometimes send emails really late at night (unless I know they are ok with it like a friend) but never texts and never with the expectation of them being responded to until the next day. And a work schedule should be set way in advance if it‚Äôs not (barring an emergency) your boss is incompetent.Fuck this shit you‚Äôre not a robot or a god damn slaveWe need stronger labor laws that help out the employee in the US of A.  An employer doesn't have any responsibility to give you any prior notice before changing your schedule.  What did the boomers do to allow the implementation of so many employer leaning labor laws?!?  The greatest and silent generation fought tooth and nail to secure favorable labor laws!  We need to restart the fight.Fired without cause would result in the being eligible for unemployment benefits which looks like that would be the case here if OP was an hourly employee.\s\sIve been a supervisor for a  long time and I got to tell you on the unemployment benefits side employees have a huge advantage. Ive had an employee get approved for unemployment  after the employee refused to work refused to leave the floor and only left the building when the cops arrived.\s\sShowing you fired an employee with cause is tough to do now. There needs to be a paper trail and often a bad employee can cause a lot of harm by the time the required paper trail is completed. Other employees get frustrated you lose productivity and the stress is overwhelming.\s\sThe employees that are good will want to know why this person wasnt fired sooner but they dont realize that the amount of unemployment claims levied against a company influences how much the company will pay the following year into employment taxes.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sI know its cool now to think every companies is a billion dollar business who take advantage of the workers while the owner sits back counting money. Thats not the case with most businesses.Are you in in? No I'm out out. Fucker!Sounds like you should quit this job.  What does this have to do with work being bad though?Dude what in the actual fuck.‚úäüåπI worked for a guy that did this he texted me at 3:30am and asked me to meet him at our usual spot for 6:00am. I woke up at 6:30 to a phone call from him I looked at my phone put it back down went back to sleep and never called him back.I honestly fail to understand how a thinking person could have arrived at the conclusion that a text at 3.30am to show up for work in 2.5 hours was appropriate.At rhi point I think he just needs some reason that he can scribble onto your firing papers.Sounds like this guy thinks he‚Äôs in the mafiaI recently started a part time job getting around 10 hours a week. I wanted to push it up to 20 or 30 so I talked to my manager one night at 10pm after a shift saying I'd like to pick up a couple more days if it was possible. \s\sHe said ""can you come in tomorrow at 9?""\s\s""I can't sorry I have a doctor's appointment. I can work after 12 if you need me though""\s\sNo response for the rest of the night but i woke up to this in the morning.\s\s""You said you wanted more shifts but it looks to me like you're unwilling to spare the time for them. I'll keep you at 2 shifts per week for the near future.""\s\sI just gave up. 10 hours is all I'm getting I suppose.This reminds me of when my coworker texted me at 5am if I can take the 7am shift instead. I read his text at 7 and ignored it. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIs this retail?\s\sMan this is rough. My job is total shit but at least it's calendar based.This sub is a bunch of lazy ass neckbeards isn't it.Project much?Call HR. Fuck this shit.Lol there's no HR where I work.HR isn‚Äôt there for your protection. It‚Äôs there to protect the company.Let me say this and I hope everyone internalizes this.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sHR IS NOT YOUR FRIEND! THis should be common knowledge for anyone working from a minimum paying salary to million dollar jobs.\s\sHR's job is simple. To protect the business at all costs from employees. It's been sold as a protector of the workers it's literally the opposite.\s\sNever trust your HR with anything they do not have your best interest at hand.\s\sNow under normal circumstances of course they're there to help you out and manage your employment relationship with teh company and all that. They're not 100% against you. But the minute you have beef with your employer your best bet is to lawyer up before you even discuss the situation with HR. Because they'll just screw you over with a smile of course. NEVER FORGET THIS!This sounds like a restaurant industry job.This is why I added a clause that states I get double time if I come in on my day off. It took some time to get gm to sign it. I don‚Äôt get called very often now. Pretty nice.Do they have a social media presence? If so I‚Äôd be on twitter tagging the company and hopefully you can gain some traction and go from there. Also you‚Äôre more than likely eligible for unemployment. They will try and fight it but show up to the court hearing. Those commissioners are usually pro labor. If you show them the texts they‚Äôll rule in your favor. Than milk unemployment if you can to really fuck your ex employerYou cannot legally be fired for not going to work on a day off without at least 24 hours notice. Also most states have a law in place that you cannot be fired for not going to work on a scheduled day off no matter the situation. If you didn't say ""yes I will be there"" you don't have to go.""you are in monday morning at 9 pm [please]"" - yes master...Specious as fuck is what this situation is. Just specious. What a dumbshit manager.What a dumb fucking idea. How brain dead do you have to be to think that there would be support for something like that? \s\s""Either go fight in our unnecessary wars or pay for the privilege to not have to suffer life-long debilitation or even death.""How about helping veteran using the bloated military budget instead. Oh wait we need the money to create more wars!! How are we going to get the money to help the veterans???? America is addicted to wars and it needs a cure.I didn't think anyone in their right mind could support Trump and his antics. Yet here we are.So the intent here is to lower support for wars because the unaffected populace would have to pay for the results pretty directly. \s\sReal shit way to advertise it but at least War Tax isnt like positive connotations or anything.beto o'rourke is a cuntI don't care about soldiers give even a less of a fuck about veterans. Make me pay a war tax fuckers.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI hate wars and disagree with sending young men to their deaths because grumpy old men are sociopaths playing Risk. The rich should pay the war taxes if anyone has to.Edgy. Maybe try having a little respect for people who would sacrifice their lives for you.Atleast half of the 2020 Democratic candidates are conservatives I swear to god.Thats definitely the fastest way to turn veteran worshippers into veteran haters.How out of touch do you need to be to think this is a good idea?https://m.imgur.com/r/iasip/Shgm1GBWork is freedom. Taxation is wealth!It is always more and more taxes to support these ""heroes without capes."" American politicians love toting around these ""heroes without capes"" in order to get Americans to open up their wallets. \s\sMany cities have already become bankrupt because of local politicians promising outrageous pensions and wages to the local police firefighters teachers and local administrators unions.  They have high property taxes just for unions and government corruption.US unions seem to be so weird.. Kinda like the government mandated union you had in the single party GDR...I knew Beto was an idiotBye Beto the poor wont pay for your wars.Soooo....if I didn't serve in the military even if I wanted to and got rejected...I don't get healthcare but instead have to pay for theirs? Uhh my trimonthly $800 endocrinologist appointments have already sucked me dry sorry y'all!For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know who Corey Pein is he wrote an incredible antiwork book called [Live Work Work Work Die](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/books/review/silicon-valley-live-work-work-work-die-corey-pein.html). It‚Äôs about how terrible working conditions in the Silicon Valley tech world is. He also has a good podcast called News From Nowhere.Beto is fucking clueless.He is part of the establishment like trump biden etc. Only Bernie can save America. Bernie 2020!This is one of those meme articles that circulates about but isn't actually true.But hey at least we get 80 years of life expectancy in order to consume BS and work until we break!!!...And boasts about their 'great work ethic.'A vicious form of inverted totalitarianism.But at least we have iphones!I've literally never had a vacation. Where I work doesn't offer paid vacations and I cant afford to lose a pay check. Seeing as I'm constantly living paycheck to paycheck.But...this is totally expected because of the nature of farm work. Farm work is very seasonal and peasants didn‚Äôt do much in the way of ‚Äúwork‚Äù outside of sewing and harvesting. Peasants took the entire time from harvest to planting not working. And even for harvest and planting it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork‚Äù as we view it now. Once a peasant had met their feudal obligation and had enough to feed their family they stopped working. There was no social or legal mechanism to compel them to work once their food-rent was paid. There was no economic need to farm for the market. \s\sSo yeah. The average worker at any point in industrial history in any nation works more than the average peasant and that would be true under capitalism communism or fascism. Oh yeah. Try reading about early industrial workers fresh from the farms. They'd put down tools randomly to go drink for the rest of the day they'd disappear the day after their paycheck to go harvest for their cousin without notice only to appear at the factory 3 weeks later expecting the same worktable when they needed a bit of extra cash. They'd work precisely as much as they wanted to they'd take every religious holiday they could find on a Church calendar and it drove the capitalists mad.Thanks for this.[deleted]That's a common misconception but medieval people still had to make and maintain their tools over the winter. Weaving baskets making carriages farm equipment or just decorations to sell to their higher ups was a thing.This one is a little weak in invoking my anti work rage\s\sWouldn‚Äôt peasants not have days off but instead just be unemployed lmaoI‚Äôm pretty sure peasants were always ‚Äúemployed‚Äù. You swear fealty to the king and you are one of his subjects for life. Your job was to be a peasant and farm the land when possible otherwise just sit there and don‚Äôt revolt.Modern America really is a soulless place with no sense of actual community. \s\sHow many of you have someone that you really trust and ""has your back?"" How about someone you could tell your deepest insecurities to? \s\sYeah that's why there's a suicide epidemic. We can't even ADMIT to each other our basic humanity without fear of a psychopath (employers pseudo friends) taking it and ruining us for good.\s\sOne of the most important questions I thought of on shrooms is ""why the fuck do we keep personal secrets from each other?

What's wrong with this culture...maaaaaaaaaaan?!"" *says guy with dinner plates for pupils*American society isn't created to help people. This society just exploits people for their labor to maximize profits for some business selling a **luxury** service/product usually not selling an actual necessity needed to live. It really is a country of sociopaths. \sPeople don't matter. Just maximizing profits. Very skewed priorities.Food for thought.

Or more.[Capitalist system dehumanizes and alienates workers](https://www.themilitant.com/2014/7833/783349.html)I think--somehow--this may be tied with the surge in ""business earnestness"" in this century.

It went from bad to worse and will eventually get to disaster.Yes and at the same time in some parts of the country $15/hr is too much especially for small businesses.  It's a short-sighted recipe for disaster.15.59 in San Francisco! And record level of old established restaurants and mom and pop shops closing this year. Record level of homeless.\s\sWe need UBI and mandatory housing for the homeless.I took a train to Seattle where they have $15 MW. It is held up as an example of this policy working well. Maybe it does I am honestly not that informed on the matter but what I can say is I gave a homeless guy a dollar and he was unimpressed and had the gall to ask me for a $5 instead. It just makes sense to me on an intuitive level if the floor is raised for the wage earners then those who weren't collecting a wage before or after that raise will suffer.It actually increased income inequality as businesses opted not to hire low skilled workers. A portion of the MW workers also didn‚Äôt see their salary change as businesses cut work hours.To the top with youthis is the main driving reason why I'm behind yang I like a lot of his other policies as well but the FD will help end this. the FJG won't apply to some homeless and from my experience will only make things worse as prices go up and it becomes more and more of a clusterfuck. \s\swe are talking about the same government who couldn't even handle a simple website when obamacare came out now we're going to rely on them to do something more complicated like giving everyone a job?I see a lot busiensses closing in west LA. A lot of them are in business for 20 years. Minimum wage is definitely not helping on top of ever rising rent. They are choking business owners assuming the revenue is somehow magically double every yearSpeaking of things you see in West LA we better be seeing you at Yang Day today in Santa Monica üò¨If you dont bring $15 dollars of value no business will hire you for $15 dollars. Some of these people might have jobs if the minimum way were $10.Potentially controversial comment here: this is largely NOT an income or housing problem. This is a DRUG problem. The vast majority of these homeless people are addicts.\sFortunately Yang's approach to drugs would directly help them through a focus on treatment and rehab. Only after addressing their addiction issues will the freedom dividend help. Otherwise guess where that $1k/month will be goingI strongly disagree. It may be valid to say that it is in part a drug problem but it is definitely not a bigger part of the issue than housing income or mental health.They usually become addicts once they‚Äôve become homeless not before; it‚Äôs a vice born from escapism. People who have lost hope are more likely to engage in self-destructive behavior.Please remember we are here as a representation of Andrew Yang.

0,ABoringDystopia,Anarcho_Capitalism,85,"I see the problem. People are homeless so we should all pay money to buy them a place to sleep. And some food. It's the only compassionate thing to do.\s\sBut wait there's more. They are mostly homeless because of mental illness or medical bills. So we really should pay for everyone's medical bills therapy and psyc meds all the time.\s\sBut wait there's more. The cause of mental illness is a poor family environment that includes abuse and neglect because parents are to busy to care for children or don't know how. We need to pay for day care and for parenting training and assistance.\s\sBut wait there's more. The parents really needed better education in the first place. Let's pay for their retraining plus 19 years of school for free for their children. And unlimited school resources and buildings. Because nothing is more important than America's children.\s\sBut really we don't pay teachers enough. They should be a highly paid and valued position around 100k per year.\s\sIt's not hard to pay for all of this. We need to just tax the richest 1% with a small tax and we also need the federal government to take over things like medicine pharmacy and schooling. The real problem is all of these companies developing things that make people's lives better because of their motive for profit. \s\sWell it goes something like that. In the end everything is owned or regulated by the government and everything is expensive because it's free.I mean... half that shit I actually believe in but only if it is voluntary private charity so there is no perverse incentives and moral hazards and we're actually solving poverty homelessness and addiction rather than subsidizing it.So somebody teaches for hours somewhere but the only place available to them to sit down is a subway station bench?\s\sI call BS on that.I saw this earlier and what struck me was the rose colored glasses view of homelessness. I'm sorry having a bench configured to deter sleeping rough is not the pressing issue of homelessness... the issue is the homelessness. Not to mention some homeless encounters I've had have been absolute nightmare fuel. When I worked retail one big burly homeless man once demanded I buy him cookies. I laughed and realized he wasnt joking. He then demanded I let him steal the cookies he says ""me going hungry that's on you"" and stomped off. Like wtf dude there are 2 churches within a 20 minute walk and at least one secular charity as well. The entitlement was off the charts. I dont even live in a welfare generous state. I can only imagine it's much worse elsewhere.\s\s\sI feel bad for good people caught in a bad situation. However the truth is that a lot of homeless people refuse help but demand handouts.Exactly. I don‚Äôt think those people have ever actually had to deal with the homeless outside of the random panhandler at the traffic light that is. They‚Äôve never been straight up harassed or made to feel unsafe. And since it‚Äôs an anti-capitalism sub you can bet your ass none of them have ever had to deal with the homeless camping out and using the sidewalk as a toilet right in front of their place of business. Of course some of them honestly fall on hard times and aren‚Äôt just dirty crack fiends. I have empathy for them but between churches charities and government programs you really have to go out of your way to stay down.People who think all or most homeless people are some kind of Rousseauian 'noble savage' have never spent any time with the homeless. A lot of them really are just bad people who make bad choices never take responsibility for themselves and blame all their problems on others. \s\sOf course *not all of them* are that but many. And they're exactly the kind of people you don't want living in a subway station getting high and/or drunk molesting passers-by and shitting on the stairs. The anti-sleeping benches are perfectly justified.[deleted][removed][deleted]The whole sub is about capitalismIt's not about ""punishing"" the homeless it's about catering to the customers' needs who do not want to see homeless wandering around the shelves in grocery stores. That is as far as capitalists' repulsion towards homeless goes. And that repulsion is not universal either; Walmart for example embraces the homeless and allows them to sleep on many of its parking lots. Also virtually all major companies regularly donate to homeless shelters.\s\sThe picture though is a direct result of governmental action. I'm confused as to how it can possibly be attributed to capitalism.Bring a fold out chairIsn't the whole purpose of this because they want some place for actual riders to rest (lean against) that won't be monopolized by a homeless person?\s\sThis is a free bonus given to riders (a place to sit and rest).  The whole point of this design is to prevent homeless from taking away the ""free"" service offered to riders.capitalism enables the states actionsIf there was a bench it would be covered in piss and occupied by a sleeping bum. Either way if you wanna sit down call an Uber idiot.Oh yes ancaps bravely defending the homeless when they'd rather have them working for ‚Ç¨0.30 an hour shoveling dirt to go home to a tin shack no health insurance and barely enough food to survive. A planned economy is the only answer to these intrinsic problems of capitalism. The boom & bust cycles hunger homelessness unemployment lack of access to education and healthcare etc.Sir this is a taco bellJust in case anyone missed what's going on in Minneapolis this altercation happened yesterday morning. Apparently the mpd got the wrong apartment and then this happened. And yeah he was a legal gun owner with a concealed carry permitThis is why no knock raids are fucking dumbdo you have proof that he has a concealed carry?So murderJesus fucking Christ.. \s\sSo when the bbq? I'm looking forward to a nice pig roastive never understood this line of thought. a boot (cops) are stepping on your throat. fighting against the boot might let you  breath for a second but then youll get punched or or stomped with another foot. \s\swe need to put the pressure and bring that resentment on the person wearing the boot (gov and centralized finance) and focus on stopping their threat to us with draconian rules and laws. \s\sCops just do what they are told with the power they are given. if the people above them were brought in line we could actually accomplish something.Do you have a Source explaining ehat happened?https://youtu.be/VRj5kpHgGYY it's the city trying to explain it sorry my reddit skills suckThose aren't search results. They're ads.Probably targeted adds. Try checking again with incognito or a device that's isn't yoursThose results are ads targeted specifically against you; the average Joe certainly doesn't  get anything resembling results like that.Thems addsthis is a result of your search queries lolWhat do these people think happens when everyone now has $1000 each month? Guess how much rent is gonna increase by. Why don‚Äôt we just cut taxes instead? I don‚Äôt get the reasoning behind itThese people want free stuff not to learn about economicsI get the same results on google but who doesn't use duckduckgo by now?Im not OP but I thought the point of the post was ""hey at least FEE etc have ads that can target UBI stans. There are several libertarian leaning young people who love UBI because they don't know how momwy works and these ads might target a few of them. \s\sObviously normal people will see a salon article or Yangs faceLooks like the Koch brothers are putting out big time for this election. Not that I have anything against them they are a needed counterbalance to other lobbyist groups.Hey fam UBI might workMight be successful in taking your money without permission and putting you in a cage if you refuseThey‚Äôre also likely scared that someone will file a billion dollar lawsuit because they got a touch of diarrhea from their day-old sandwich.Yeah my tummy hurts now gib money.I mean they're right.  If you're in that position while immoral it definitely makes logical sense to try to bamboozle your way into a huge lawsuit over some trivial bullshit.  People take advantage of other's kindness like this all the fucking time.Can't get diarrhea if you don't eat anything! /sLeft: We throw out hundreds of billions of dollars worth of food every year!!!  Evil capitalism!!\s\sAlso left: We should never allow any chance of tainted food in our poorest communities!!  We need a ton of regulations to stop this from ever happening!!Simple answer! Hire more bureaucrats to make sure the food is safe enough to be donated. I think we need a team of - let's say - 15 per neighborhood. Ez.Companies probably used to give it away ages ago then some smarty pants thought he could get rich by sueing the company for food poisoning and ever since then the food industry decided throwing it away is just better.They certainly did in the small town I grew up in. Nowadays probably not.Yep in fact I‚Äôm pretty sure this happened all the time in Depression era America.Don't they have good Samaritan laws to stop that?Several users on Quora wrote that transporting perishables is time-sensitive and costly. So someone at a food bank would need the ability to pick up food in short order the means to store it and the need to give away food that's rapidly becoming too old to sell. Otherwise it's impractical to give away.How about... simply giving it away to your nearest homeless? No middle men/orgs requiredThere was a famous or rather infamous case in my country when a baker went bankrupt because he made him pay tax on bread he gave away insted of throwingAs if the homeless people aren't going to dig it out of the trash anyway.cApTiAlIsM sTaRvEs PpLThis can be used or even better: THIS CAN BE SOLD\sI dont know where is this photo from but there is an app in Europe called TooGoodToGo in which restaurants are selling perfectly fine ""leftovers"" for 1/4 of the price. You pay like 4‚Ç¨ and get package (you dont know the volume or even whats in there) and get for example two lunch meals or two bags of delicious sweetbuns and coffee.\sI dont know is it working in US but c'mon this is not unsolvable problem.Many Americans aren't interested in solving problems.  They just want to create more problems so we can have more government.*eyes narrow and begin to stare into the devils soul*\s\s**Fucking capitalism** at it again.I like how people that hold ideologies that literally starved millons to death are now lecturing private businessman about how to dispose of the abundance that capitalism provides. \sIs that people that would benefit from that food being donated dying of hunger?It's almost like liberal cities out there have laws against feeding the homelessBut why would Bubberment do this?More bureaucratic waste on account of ""this is how we're supposed to do things""What‚Äôs the problem here? If you are hungry and you want some free food go grab the restaurant‚Äôs trash.Then dont buy from that restaurant or other restaurants if you support homeless people.\sAlso food expiration dates are arbitrary because unopened food that is fresh is ""contaminated"" according to the label.resturaunt lobbies are the ones who got those rules put into place arent they? so people cant just wait a day and swing by the shelter or whatever to eat it then for free and the business owners dime\s\sit's a horrendous waste but let's not act like resturaunts WANT to give this away. the government otherwise wouldn't give a shitBelieve me govt gives a shit. The first case of some problem the first rotten food the first person with a stomach bug the first complaint that comes in and they (appear to) absolutely care. They swear they will ""do something"" and then form a commission including local restaurants  to help guide the formation of the impending regulations which at THAT point the (politically connected) restaurants absolutely try to game.There are around 3 million drivers so instead of buying his $72.5m home he could have given each driver a one time $24.17 bonus.  Big fucking deal.\s\sIt's a free country if you think you can create a competing company which pays drivers more go for it.\s>It's a free country if you think you can create a competing company which pays drivers more go for it.\s\sThat's an entirely false premise when we are constrained by the set political economic system- ignoring capital bias and other power bias' is ignoring the basis of the economy. I find it odd that you say it's a free country... when we both know it is far from that. No you just defend capitalism even when it's filled with rent-seeking and revolving door regulators smh. The industry that I work in it cost $10000 just to be considered for a license; free country my ass.I don't think Uber was intended to be a full time job. More something you do on the side to make some income with the vehicle you already own. But correct me if I'm wrong.You are 100% right. I have a friend that only drives for Uber on his route to and from his day job lolYou can definitely make it full time in a place like Vegas but I‚Äôd say most everywhere else it‚Äôs just not feasible.Can't wait until it's mostly gig opportunities... so people can work 15 jobs instead of three. You people are so callous.Uber driver: Pay me more\s\sUber: Pays more\s\s\*old drivers come back and new drivers join due to ease of entry as they see rise in pay.\*\*while less people use uber due to rise in cost no there is a over saturated market\*\s\sUber driver: why am I not getting any rides.\s\s\*grr supply and demand\*\s\s&#x200B;\s\sIDK what rideshare drivers are expecting. get paid $50 a ride and expect no one else to start driving for uber and lyft. While maintaining the same amount of riders?\s\s&#x200B;\s\sI drive for uber and do 1-3 rides on a weekend(how gig econ is suppose to work). If the rates would go up so would the amount of rides i give. Taking away from the full time uber drivers. They will just sit in their cars wait getting paid nothing.Who would have thought that a job requiring no skill qualifications or even a job interview would be low paid?  \s\s\sReally **truly** shockingI'm a Doordash driver. I don't know how much the Doordash CEO makes nor do I care.  Not relevant to my life.  I work a lot of hours because I choose to.  As an independent contractor overtime laws thankfully don't apply.  Keep a pillow in my car in case I want a power nap but don't wanna go home for it. Doesn't make me any kind of victim merely something I choose to do.  Do-gooders can let me alone thanks. Don't need them to help me by questioning my choices.A full time driver can make 30k a year? Probably in LA. Not in the rest of America. That's some decent money for the easiest skill to learn.Especially considering every other car in LA has that stupid sticker on their window lol\s\sNot to mention they‚Äôre all usually shitty drivers tooThis is the thing... I don‚Äôt understand why people are so wrapped around an hourly wage. You‚Äôre paid by the ride not by the hour. Ride shares can‚Äôt increase the demand without lowering rates. Therefore even if someone gets more rides they‚Äôre breaking even. \s\sIf riders want an hourly guarantee I am certain that will come with a ride minimum. Realistically that number should be between 8-12 rides an hour for a guarantee. Which... can not be consistent.Worker entitlement is so annoying. Your job wouldn‚Äôt even exist without those entrepreneurs yet you feel entitled to their earnings.Envious little kids with no skillzUber drivers in my area where muscled out. You can still get them but most people go with already existing taxi companies that also have apps of their own. They are not as sophisticated as uber's. But it shows the vehicle approaching on a map. With the taxi company they are all independent workers and set their own hours and I think the cut the company takes is over half uber's and they have existed for decades with that model they just never had an app.\s\sSo shows anyone can start a taxi company.[deleted]Having a job is voluntary. Gotta love the free market. Go somewhere where you will be valued more. If everyone did this the job market would be betterLooks like somebody did the math and found out that they could (temporarily) make more money on unemployment and then lashed out at their employer to justify it lolzThere are exceptions but the vast majority of people who voluntarily quit their job arent eligible for unemployment. Even when you're fired you generally arent eligible for unemployment. There are exceptions but *generally speaking* you're only eligible for unemployment if you were laid off through no fault of your own. \s\sThis varies state to state but as a general rule if you quit or are fired for a reason that is your fault you cant get unemployment. You gotta be laid off usually.BoohooI‚Äôd rather pay less in taxes over getting a bloated and incompetent healthcare solutionMy dude. The US has the most bloated and inefficient healthcare system among advanced nations. $4000/day? $200 for tylenol? $600+ for insulin? The stories you hear about bad National healthcare are bs propoganda. Not one person outside the highest tax bracket would give it up.25%?\s\sCasual.If you're getting 25% stolen you're doing something wrongHealthcare as a right means enslavement of providers of healthcare.  OP is pro slavery.Without knowing though. Thing is most people arent aware that taxation is a form of slavery. And using taxes for whatever reason is a form of slave abuse. \s\sEven if its for the benefit of the slaves. This is important. Because a slave owner always has expenses to benefit the slaves or he will lose them very quickly. \s\sIn the southern states of america back then slave owners had to feed their slaves and this wasnt free. Just as the governments today provide streets and healthcare. But its still exploitation and slavery. Doesnt change it. Never did never will.[deleted]What a terrible world it would be if people could decide for themselves what to do with their money really really terrible.""I'll pay 25% of 0 taxes you''ll pay 70% to fund everyone""Then go get health insurance.If he's making enough to get taxed 25% then he's at a job that offers healthcare.  I call bs.The ridiculous ""healthcare is a right"" argument aside how is this considered ""humor""?So the assumption is that those that ask that question are all for killing children? I think the question and answer are a bit more complicated than a meme.The corporation/owner that you work for takes way more in profit from what you make from your work than taxes take. Why is the taxes part the thing that pisses you off? You wouldn't even be able to go to work without all the things taxes pay for.More government will fix thatSomeone should hook her up with a dentist appointment.Are you sure it‚Äôs the government and not a for-profit contracting firm?That‚Äôs great.

Those ‚Äúlegal‚Äù drugs are controlled by an even worse cartel already.  Too much competition.The concept of a prescription is the biggest scam that exists.What you would probably see emerge in that scenario is black market regulatory institutions. People would want to ensure that the insulin they're getting is actually insulin. It's conceivable that you might have watchdog organizations that monitor the manufacture and quality of the insulin that's being produced. Not skipping regulation but privatizing it.Pharma drugs can be bought on the darknet and looking at some of the big investigations the main catalyst for the investigation was so called ""counterfeit pharmaceuticals"" and i don't mean generics when I say that.[deleted]Canada also doesn't have the US FDA blocking safe and useful drugs for nearly a decade before they can be sold."

It was the same in 2018 I think I might have had my teeth cleaned in 2017. Before that I visited an ER back in 2015 and got a couple of stitches think I paid about half of that $8000 bill before that were more years of paying for a plan for absolutely no reason. I guess this means I‚Äôm lucky better to have insurance and not need it ... but what a fuckin‚Äô scam! I ‚Äúsave‚Äù more for medical care than I do for retirement - and I max my yearly 403b. Meanwhile the old people that actually spend healthcare money are all on Medicare!That's how a functioning health insurance system works.  The problem in the us is that private companies get the profit from you while the government gets the brunt of the people on Medicare.\sA functioning system like in Canada is the same thing but the government pays the hospitals directly at fixed rates and ostensibly eliminates some of the for profit motive from it.  That cuts the costs to swallowable levels.  That $8000 bill for stitches is a few hundred here to the best of my knowledge.I really can't remember in the last decade the last time I got sick to be honest.. hay fever.. but that's cured with a nasal rinse..Yeah most health problems come from people treating their body like shit...Just don't get sick.

There can't be discrimination against black people because that would be illegal and no one would ever break the law.Racism is not over especially not in the US where the whole country is fucking racist af. Half of the country is white supremacists while the other half is POC supremacists. There are very few non racist people in US. This country is literally retarded.This happened to me when I moved to Texas. You register to vote when you get your driver license. When election season rolled around I wasn‚Äôt actually registered even though I handed the form in. Rather than something nefarious I figured the form just didn‚Äôt make it through the system. Maybe the person processing them was just like I want to go home today and thew a bunch in the trash. I dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI have literally registered at the polls... is my vote counted or is that them just placating me?It depends on the state. Not all states allow for registering at the polls.Like someone else said it varies by state and by election. \s\sFormer MD chief election judge (meaning I was one of two top people at a polling center) here. During primaries you can register for the general election but you can't vote that day. Or if it's the general election good luck in two to four years. If your info doesn't match (changed name address affiliation etc.) you can fill out a form and vote ""provisional"" which in real life means it only counts if the numbers are close. Also if it's a change of address you have the option to go back to your registered polling place to vote. \s\sSo in essence at least in MD make sure you are registered with the correct information as soon as possible before an election.\s\sEdit: I'm offering the simplest answer to MD voting law in this regard. I still have my manuals and can cite them if needed. I don't know about other states.XDLord I don‚Äôt even want to live in America at this pointI was kinda just born here.okay okay okay I'm not American and here we don't register to vote so can someone fill me in and explain how registering to vote works and what are the criteria you need to meet? I thought it was literally just being over 18 and nothing elseIt's bull shit basically. Just a way to count your vote before you actually vote.Long story short you have to fill out a form and provide documentation of your legal status to vote sometimes at the local motor vehicle administration sometimes at the election office either way long before you consider voting. And if you change your name or address (marriage moving etc.) you have to go through the same process. \s\sThey want to make sure Mrs. X living in Bigtown State Y is voting at the correct location so that the same person Ms. Z living in Small-town State A isn't voting twice.\s\sEdit: Highly simplified. Politics invade on a whole slew of other ""voter fraud"" issues including keeping those without homes or others deemed ""lesser"" in the voting pool. Don't even bring up gerrymandering or illegals. Shit gets complicated.\s\sEdit 2: It always boggled my mind when ""counters"" would come in legally at the end of the night to figure out how many people of a demographic voted. Not ***what*** they voted just how they were registered. Results showed up on the news long before any votes we're tallied. Seriously watch this shit the next time an election rolls around. It takes at least 24hrs to get all the machines/paper ballots counted but sure as shit there's a ""winning vote"" posted as each state closes elections.This is completely egregious and should never happen but if there‚Äôs any election where you should go out of your way to quadruple check your registration this is the one.American democracy is a sham.I had no idea this was a thing so I looked up the article. The article said black people are more likely to have felony convictions and minorities commonly have the same name in their family so wrong people are taken off. Error up to 17% is crazy high though!

Lots of people are and it's usually a mistake.They‚Äôre only purging people who have moved out of the precinct have died have been convicted of felonies or have not voted in the last 6 election cycles. Mr. Burns is full of shit. Sorry he is. Now I admit the purging because of not voting for the last 6 cycles is shitty and should not be done. I whole heartedly disagree with that line of thought. All of the rest are legit though. Period.The state is Georgia is purging voters left and right. If you live in the state please check your registration.Confused canadian here... how exactly does that even happen? In Canada all you need to vote is 18 years of age and a Citizenship and that's basically the end of it. Only time where I've seen friends unable to vote is because they forgot to update their address after moving in from another cities and couldn't make the trip to vote in the municipality on their out-of-date address.   \s\s\sOther than that that's it. You don't need to register. All you need to do is show up with your ID at any voting booth within your address' riding (and since we have socialized health care every single canadian citizen has a valid government ID from that. Not having an ID on your person in Canada in general is considered unusual...)I cannot beleive this is just targeted to black people.

They gave him several pieces which he placed in a heap on a clean piece of paper and having borrowed the pocket knives they used to cut and eat their dinners with from Easton Harlow and Philpot he addressed them as follows:\s\s‚ÄòThese pieces of bread represent the raw materials which exist naturally in and on the earth for the use of mankind; they were not made by any human being but were created by the Great Spirit for the benefit and sustenance of all the same as were the air and the light of the sun.‚Äô\s\s... ‚ÄòNow‚Äô continued Owen ‚ÄòI am a capitalist; or rather I represent the landlord and capitalist class. That is to say all these raw materials belong to me. It does not matter for our present argument how I obtained possession of them or whether I have any real right to them; the only thing that matters now is the admitted fact that all the raw materials which are necessary for the production of the necessaries of life are now the property of the Landlord and Capitalist class. I am that class: all these raw materials belong to me.‚Äô\s\s... ‚ÄòNow you three represent the Working Class: you have nothing ‚Äì and for my part although I have all these raw materials they are of no use to me ‚Äì what I need is ‚Äì the things that can be made out of these raw materials by Work: but as I am too lazy to work myself I have invented the Money Trick to make you work for me. But first I must explain that I possess something else beside the raw materials. These three knives represent ‚Äì all the machinery of production; the factories tools railways and so forth without which the necessaries of life cannot be produced in abundance. And these three coins‚Äô ‚Äì taking three halfpennies from his pocket ‚Äì ‚Äòrepresent my Money Capital.‚Äô\s\s‚ÄòBut before we go any further‚Äô said Owen interrupting himself ‚Äòit is most important that you remember that I am not supposed to be merely ‚Äúa‚Äù capitalist. I represent the whole Capitalist Class. You are not supposed to be just three workers ‚Äì you represent the whole Working Class.‚Äô\s\s... Owen proceeded to cut up one of the slices of bread into a number of little square blocks.\s\s‚ÄòThese represent the things which are produced by labour aided by machinery from the raw materials. We will suppose that three of these blocks represent ‚Äì a week‚Äôs work. We will suppose that a week‚Äôs work is worth ‚Äì one pound: and we will suppose that each of these ha‚Äôpennies is a sovereign. ...\s\s‚ÄòNow this is the way the trick works -‚Äô\s\s... Owen now addressed himself to the working classes as represented by Philpot Harlow and Easton.\s\s‚ÄòYou say that you are all in need of employment and as I am the kind-hearted capitalist class I am going to invest all my money in various industries so as to give you Plenty of Work. I shall pay each of you one pound per week and a week‚Äôs work is ‚Äì you must each produce three of these square blocks. For doing this work you will each receive your wages; the money will be your own to do as you like with and the things you produce will of course be mine to do as I like with. You will each take one of these machines and as soon as you have done a week‚Äôs work you shall have your money.‚Äô\s\sThe Working Classes accordingly set to work and the Capitalist class sat down and watched them. As soon as they had finished they passed the nine little blocks to Owen who placed them on a piece of paper by his side and paid the workers their wages.\s\s‚ÄòThese blocks represent the necessaries of life. You can‚Äôt live without some of these things but as they belong to me you will have to buy them from me: my price for these blocks is ‚Äì one pound each.‚Äô\s\sAs the working classes were in need of the necessaries of life and as they could not eat drink or wear the useless money they were compelled to agree to the kind Capitalist‚Äôs terms. They each bought back and at once consumed one-third of the produce of their labour. The capitalist class also devoured two of the square blocks and so the net result of the week‚Äôs work was that the kind capitalist had consumed two pounds worth of the things produced by the labour of the others and reckoning the squares at their market value of one pound each he had more than doubled his capital for he still possessed the three pounds in money and in addition four pounds worth of goods. As for the working classes Philpot Harlow and Easton having each consumed the pound‚Äôs worth of necessaries they had bought with their wages they were again in precisely the same condition as when they started work ‚Äì they had nothing.\s\sThis process was repeated several times: for each week‚Äôs work the producers were paid their wages. They kept on working and spending all their earnings. The kind-hearted capitalist consumed twice as much as any one of them and his pile of wealth continually increased. In a little while ‚Äì reckoning the little squares at their market value of one pound each ‚Äì he was worth about one hundred pounds and the working classes were still in the same condition as when they began and were still tearing into their work as if their lives depended upon it.\s\sAfter a while the rest of the crowd began to laugh and their merriment increased when the kind-hearted capitalist just after having sold a pound‚Äôs worth of necessaries to each of his workers suddenly took their tools ‚Äì the Machinery of Production ‚Äì the knives away from them and informed them that as owing to Over Production all his store-houses were glutted with the necessaries of life he had decided to close down the works.\s\s‚ÄòWell and what the bloody ‚Äòell are we to do now?‚Äô demanded Philpot.\s\s‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not my business‚Äô replied the kind-hearted capitalist. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve paid you your wages and provided you with Plenty of Work for a long time past. I have no more work for you to do at present. Come round again in a few months‚Äô time and I‚Äôll see what I can do for you.‚Äô\s\s‚ÄòBut what about the necessaries of life?‚Äô demanded Harlow. ‚ÄòWe must have something to eat.‚Äô\s\s‚ÄòOf course you must‚Äô replied the capitalist affably; ‚Äòand I shall be very pleased to sell you some.‚Äô\s\s‚ÄòBut we ain‚Äôt got no bloody money!‚Äô\s\s‚ÄòWell you can‚Äôt expect me to give you my goods for nothing! You didn‚Äôt work for me for nothing you know. I paid you for your work and you should have saved something: you should have been thrifty like me. Look how I have got on by being thrifty!‚Äô\s\sThe unemployed looked blankly at each other but the rest of the crowd only laughed; and then the three unemployed began to abuse the kind-hearted Capitalist demanding that he should give them some of the necessaries of life that he had piled up in his warehouses or to be allowed to work and produce some more for their own needs; and even threatened to take some of the things by force if he did not comply with their demands. But the kind-hearted Capitalist told them not to be insolent and spoke to them about honesty and said if they were not careful he would have their faces battered in for them by the police or if necessary he would call out the military and have them shot down like dogs the same as he had done before at Featherstone and Belfast.\s\sEdit: thanks for the awards if anyone hasn't read The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists then please do.Why does this read like Jesus making a point to his disciples in a chapter in a book from the Bible?\s\sThat's not even a compliment it legitimately reminded me of reading the Bible somehow. Weird.[Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ragged-Trousered_Philanthropists)The real trick here is the capitalist class claiming ownership of the resources provided by the Earth. If they actually had to pay for them the big game would be over. It's the laborers who pay for them by the sweat of their brow and the ""owners"" keep all the profits.Great stuffCapitalism is just feudalism with extra steps.Is there a way to copy text off Reddit? I‚Äôm on my phone...Actually reminds me a little of this.\s\s[5 minute corruption game] (https://youtu.be/TJlpS4vhKP0)[removed]I like this.This is possibly the most insanely straw man argument I‚Äôve ever heard. The capitalist works 0 had all their wealth just randomly by simply proclaiming it and has people who willingly take whatever wage they are offered without arguing. This is so incredibly far from reality. \s\sPeople who own the capital we can think of executives on average work way more hours than those below them. People move up the corporate ladder all of the time and people are constantly arguing their salary.What a silly oversimplification.\s\sThe workers go to work every day and don‚Äôt care if they ruin the bread they‚Äôre working on. If they use 4 squares of bread to make 3 the capitalist is the one who pays.\s\sThe workers don‚Äôt worry about whether the bread goes stale or moldy or how to distribute it.\s\sThe workers aren‚Äôt on the hook if the capitalist fails.\s\sI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a fair system but there‚Äôs a reason 9/10 new businesses fail in the first 2 years. Calling the people who run these businesses lazy is a ridiculous statement. Do you think bezos and jobs and musk and gates are lazy?\s\sThis parable might‚Äôve made sense in 1800 England when landed gentry were still a thing but we‚Äôve moved a bit beyond that.The argument that prices will go up if wages go up just points out that we need to control prices.\sIf you want to lower the cost of living go ahead.But I want to do nothing productive whatsoever so I will find any shred of evidence that supports my doing that!It also assumes that the entire price of an object is going towards wages.Going that route concedes the point that wage raises increases prices of goods and services which has never happened before.But you can't control prices without creating limited supplies. Price controls are instituted in the US all the time After natural disasters; hurricanes blizzards fires tornadoes earthquakes etc. Politicians will yell and scream and cry about price gouging; but when supplies are limited and prices can't don't rise to meet that limited supply demand doesn't decrease so the supply runs out and won't be replenished for some amount of time. I'm not saying I think one situation huge price increases vs shortages of staples is better than the other; I actually think a compromise can be reached but that is a hugely complex economic analysis that can't be applied to 2 similar situations let alone ones that have large differences and that would take too much time to fully gather info to populate so by the time a compromise could be reached it wouldn't be necessary.""why don't you increase wages to offset cost of living?""\s\sTories: ""BECAUSE I HAAAATE YOOOUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!""Still waiting for that sweet sweet wonga precum to trickle down from the erect shaft of austerityChrist. Who is using this argument?Every idiot who takes a basic macro economics class in college then thinks they are an expert on economics.Sadists[deleted]My mom.A lot of people. There‚Äôs some truth to it. Live in LA. When our min wages go up lots of small businesses will raise price of goods to cover the loss in profit especially because it‚Äôs more cut throat here they have to do that so their business survives. So I noticed with our last min wage increase cost of food went up. My local sandwich shop raised the price from $8 to $10 for a sandwich. My local mom and pop grocery store also raised prices of goods/food. Had a local nail salon change prices on their menu. The list goes on. One other thing I noticed is that salaried people usually don‚Äôt get salary increase to match inflation unless they find a new job at a different company. I‚Äôll probably jump ship this year (hopefully) so I can get a pay increase.Disregard that frank it‚Äôs just a bunch of liberal bullshit.You‚Äôll often hear people complain about how hard they work only to end up worse off than people on benefits or only very marginally better off. Whilst they‚Äôre right that work doesn‚Äôt actually pay that well I‚Äôve always wondered why they‚Äôre angry at the people on benefits and not angry about how shite their wages are.‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A HOT ONE TODAY WALLY!‚ÄùWhat they actually mean is ""My cost of living will go up!"" They don't want to pay their workers or deal with a minor increase in prices of things they buy.Every left-leaning capitalist-favouring argument can be summed up quite simply: The negative results of leftist reform within capitalist are a glaring example of the capitalist grip on the economy and the people.\s\sWasting time debating whether capitalists will or will not fuck people over if we try to help workers is kinda pointless IMO. I mean it's important to understand by what mechanism it happens. Ultimately capitalists will use their position of power to gain profit at the expense of workers to the maximum extent they perceive as possible.\s\sWhat more needs to be said than that?If we reduce the pay of CEOs the cost of living will go down?!""Then why haven't you changed it?""\s\s""Because I hate you!""‚ÄúThen why didn‚Äôt you raise the wages?‚Äù\s\s‚ÄúBECAUSE WE HAAAAAATE YOOOOOOOU‚Äù - CEOs\s\sEdit: fuck someone did this. I‚Äôm leaving it anyway‚ÄúYour living wage would mean I‚Äôd have to buy my third yacht next year and not tomorrrrrrrooooooowwwwwwwww :(. ‚ÄúFuck minimum wage. Universal basic income. It literally solves the same problem minimum wage is trying to solve while also shifting the employer-employee power balance back towards the employee. You have UBI you don't need minimum wage.In terms of my personal experience I am earning less now than I was when the Coalition came to power. And come April the tax rules created by Labour will be implemented by the tories and I will face another 15 to 20% cut in take home.\s\sWhich is nice.It's funny how the same people never show any concern for the rising costs of living until the minimum wage gets mentioned isn't it?\s\sIn general I'd have some sympathy with people who objected to continual rises in minimum wage in order to keep up with living costs (not that it actually happens like that) if they were genuinely advocating for serious steps to address rising living costs instead but they never are.And wages have actually decreased while the cost of living have increased. If you count for inflation since the 70s only the minimum wage would be around $27. We are way behind schedule. Most people are underpaid.That‚Äôs why a $15/hr rise is nice....as a beginning. We need the minimum wage tied to inflation or whatever.Economics pop quiz: what happens to demand as price goes up?\s\sSo why would you want to force the price of labor up?because the price of labor is being forced down by those that want to pay as little as possible to make as much profit as possible.Yeah and centrally planning wages certainly isn‚Äôt going to help that.\s\shttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45090.pdf\s\s>Wages have actually been going down in real terms for decades\s\sFalseIt literally says that wages for the top of the distribution rose and wages at the bottom fell. What do you mean false? the majority of American workers have experienced a decrease in their wages......\s\sdid you read what you linked?Because the workforce increased as women stsrted to take part in it.what the fuck? Women entering the work force is the reason for rising cost of living and stagnant wages?This is why we need to ban inflation.Better idea lets ban money! :pThe federal minimum wage has been going down in real terms but ‚Äúwages‚Äù (whether you define that as median wage mean wage wages of people at the 25th percentile whatever) have been going up in real terms for decades. Title is false.The minimum wage is SUPPOSED to go up BECAUSE the cost of living is increasing!!""But why force it up demand and supply yknow""\s\si dunno... maybe cause it's being forced down?? By those that do not want to pay their workers an actual compensation for their work.but increasing the minimum wage can price some people out of work it‚Äôs fine as long as your job can‚Äôt be automated look at things like car washes that use to be a job but now it‚Äôs all automatedYes but increasing it a little doesn't quite cause massive unemployment.\s\sThere's Effectively a line that's decided by a percentage median income(or so) and if you'd go over that line then you would have massive unemployment. If you do not raise it above it things are fine. Sure a few people may have to be laid of which is bad yes. \sBut it would increase the buying power of alot of people which would stimulate the economy and thereby more jobs would open up!\s\sIts complicated and i am not infalliable nor an economist so take everytbing i say with a grain of salt.They‚Äôre getting automated anywayThe cost of living has gone down globally\s\sWealth inequality has also gone down globally\s\sSomehow Americans think that exporting their jobs overseas  by Raising their own minimum wage will fix everything which it does but not in their countryShhh they won‚Äôt like this oneThat‚Äôs like when Sam Seder talks about if Bill Gates walked into their studio the average net worth of everyone in the studio would go up into the billions or whatever. Averages are nice but you need to be able to apply more context to them to gain an actual understanding of what is happening.So has minimum wageBarely and not in sync with productivity.Fun fact: Sweden doesn‚Äôt have a minimum wageSweden is also a capitalist country with a shrinking welfare stateCost of living for non-government-intervened markets have gone down or are more productive.

Institutional racism definitely exists that was stupid but suggesting viewing performance solely through a BAME lens may not be helpful. there are clearly other socio-ecomonic forces at work.\s\sFor example saying grouping all black kids in education under one term may not be useful as some groups within that are doing better than others. so what is the commonality with the groups that doing better or worse? is it just money(it may well be)? is there something more targeted we can be doing.\s\sto take another example I'm the NE the most underperforming group is I understand poor white boys. Not poor white girls just boys. I'm that case it's good to have that data so you can figure out the cause. I know that's not to do with racism but the point is by being more granular in your groupings you can sometimes better see the problem.This is the best post I have ever seen on Reddit.

End of fucking storyYou mean like an employer? And if they're* mandatory can you claim tax relief for washing?Primary head here. I don't agree that schools should provide uniforms for free as it would financially cripple us (I know there's the argument of funding but that's a whole different avenue of discussion). However I do believe we have obligations to keep them as affordable as possible and allowing generic non-branded uniforms available cheaply in supermarkets instead of branded clothes. \sFar too many schools particularly large academy trusts are shackling parents to buying uniform at huge mark-ups to either fill their own accounts or the accounts of exclusive uniform suppliers. There are state schools in low-income areas that insist on their children wearing school branded socks. Absolutely dystopian.Yeah when you‚Äôre snatching coats off of cold and potentially poorer children you are rarely involved in something good... should be an obvious red flag. Proper ‚Äúare we the baddies‚Äù territory.My college is doing the same forcing kids to walk around in winter with no coat and the head master has said he won‚Äôt consider changing it. The school is forcing us to buy or freeze.It won't change until a kid gets hypothermia and diesI had to wear a skirt because the pants they provided were extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant to look at fit. They weren't normal formal pants at all. There were maybe 20 to 30 girls in a year that chose to wear pants because they were so unpleasant others had thick thights or just frozen thighs. There were about 10 classes per year.Same shit my secondary school did to us. Buy our hideous solid snot green coloured and shit quality school coat or freeze your bollocks off at lunch because we're never going to let you inside. This was in fucking West Belfast one of the most impoverished places in all of the UK and we constantly brought it up to senior staff that loads of lads couldn't afford it and had to freeze. Not one of them aside from the head of politics cared. Cunts.\s\sI remember people catching absolutely horrible colds in winter cuz of that shit and I caught a fair few myself.Segregation of the poor has always been a thing they love to do it. Especially to kids. So many school trips missed because parents can't afford to send their kids meanwhile the rich kids get to go everywhere and then bully the poor kids for being poor.Schools get an extra ¬£1k funding per pupil premium (poor) student. This money is used for things like school trips and revision books for those students.[removed]My kids secondary school tried to do this and the parents complained so hard they scrapped the idea. No kid is going to wear a school branded coat outside of school so it would have meant buying two winter coats.My school tried to do it and when complaints were raised they ghoulishly cited Dunblane as a reason that it was 'a necessity'.Surely the teachers have a duty of care to not let the children be cold.\sImagine being such a jobs worth you confiscate a child's coat.Especially when your politicians don't want to feed them.\s\sI mean seriously families are struggling to feed their children. The Conservatives had to be shamed into provide school meals and then they pull this shit.\s\sWhen the fuck did it become acceptable to prosecute the poor? (rethotical question)This is what some people think communism is lol.Communism is when capitalism.*Points to capitalism* this is what communism is like.communism is when poor people are banned from having coats because their parents didnt work hard enough (they didnt even have 2 full-time jobs and yet theyre complaining about minimum wage how lazy)üò§There's far worse things that could happen when you let Tories come within 500 yards of a school...For starters their ankle bracelets would go off... or RoyalsWhere do you think they got the talent for pulling cloths off young children.That's really infuriating taking clothes from *children* especially in cold weatherAnd while most schools still keep windows open in classrooms to aid ventilation due to Covid so this is not just an issue during break/outdoor time.Shit like this used to happen in my school as well only it was with hoodies they wanted us to buy coats to go over our blazers but who can afford to buy a coat like 2-3 sizes too big that they can then only wear with their uniform? I had a friend who told me she was wearing a hoodie going to school (and it was snowing that day) and a teacher who was driving past pulled over to confiscate it.\s\sEdit: another story of just how ridicilious my school was they banned hugging and told us all in assembly that its because its not an image they want assicoated with the school (wtf???) and then when parents complained the story changed to ""students were arriving late to class because they were hugging eachother between classes"" I literally experienced this and still can't believe it lmaoWe had school house hoodies and yet were not allowed to wear them onsite. These were branded hoodies! Some teachers didn‚Äôt care but one jobsworth would confiscate them and then not ever give them back. Absolutely ridiculous.Fuck off jobsworth it's winter and kids are cold why the hell are these shitlords asking for a ¬£25 coat with a shitty school branding on it?Because it saves parents having to spend money on new coats to keep their kids in the latest fashion.But think of the people who will become richer if you buy them!Tommeh Robbingscum was whinging the other day about kids in America being taught outside due to Covid I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be reporting on this too right?\s\s\sRight?Probably from one of his many mansions with his non abused wife. I'm sure he'll be coming to save themAbsolutely disgusting. I remember this happening to me when I was at school in the early 2000s my parents had to fork out hundreds for school issue uniform (including PE jumpers and equipment) when they could barely afford to put food on the table. Didn‚Äôt think this would still happen in 2022.its fucked cosnidering how fast children grow between the ages of 4 and 17. may need a new uniform every year...  \sremember a kid who has such a fast growth spurt he needed a change of uniform mid (school) year despite just buying a new one over the summer a few months prior because he out grew his then unofmr before the 6 weeks- but had to stick to wearing uncomfortable tight-ill fitting clothes because his parents lacked moneyCan we discuss punishment in school more broadly by using this case as an example. Isolation is a fucked up punishment for children. It‚Äôs how the prison system treats its most violent and disruptive offenders and that‚Äôs no coincidence. We know that social isolation in the long term has detrimental effects on the human brain. But I‚Äôd love to see studies done on the impact of this harmful punishment on children. I was constantly in isolation because I was naughty all the time (at 28 I know now that‚Äôs because I have adhd and that was never catered for or addressed in the 2000s when I was at school or even diagnosed. I would love to see the correlation data between kids with chaotic home lives or unattended neurodivergency needs and those who end up in isolation. I expect it would be high.Very difficult situation - how much impact does keeping one disruptive child in a class have on the rest of the kids?\s\sClearly isolation is not the ideal solution. Schools need the money and resources to supply every child with a good education which obviously includes teaching children with different needs differently and in different locations.\s\sBut while this isn't possible (see funding cuts to education in the last 15 years) what are schools to do? Leaving one ""naughty"" child in the class could have much wider consequences for the education grades and therefore future opportunities for every other student.\s\sTrickyisolation can be depressing. maybe i'm just an outlyer but i liked being in on my own in a locked room as deliboratly got myself into trouble because staying in (isolated) was a better way to spend my  breaks out there- especially if bullying was extremely terrible that day.\s\sdidn't help school did nothing about my bullying-so i either had to take things into my own hands or just do something different to get into trouble so i could stay in alone away from themIronically the school is down about 135k on their expenditure/income balance. \s\sI can see some bean counter getting upset and saying stupid shit to the school councillors not gonna lie.\s\sAddendum; I even ran the numbers. If even half of the kids were buying the school jackets it would put the budget back in the green. >.>Christ that's awful demanding the local parents pay to keep the school from collapsingChild abuse plain and simpleCreeping fascism get out on the street on Saturday kidsTo be fair Bishop Heber may be trying to freeze kids half to death for the sake of scalping ¬£25 a pop but plenty of bishops have done a lot worse to kids. \s\s/s (sort of)My school changed uniform midway through my time there so I only had to wear the revamped uniform for 2 years. \sBefore our uniform was a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt black trousers/skirt and black shoes. \s\sWhen we switched to blazers shirts and ties we had to buy a ¬£45 blazer a ¬£15 tie and there was an optional jumper for ¬£25. Being that I was a twin it meant my mum forked out for 2 of everything (except the jumper. Way too pricey) we also had to wear grey trousers/skirt. If you were above a classic ‚Äòschool uniform‚Äô size (I was a 6ft size 18 teen in year 9) it was pretty impossible to find a grey skirt. Mum ended up making the one I wore. Humiliating.My secondary school was one of the worst in the country in a deprived area. It was also one of the first in the area to adopt blazers and they made a big deal of making us look ""smart"".\s\sI've always gotten the impression that the schools that make a big noise about looking smart and being disciplined are compensating the fact that they're shit schools. All fur coat and no knickers as my grandma would say.Across the world these days kids are learning very early on that the authorities are not to be trusted and are not always right especially with matters concerning personal health. Funny how my parents wished a better childhood for me than theirs growing up but now I only wish for my future kids to have a childhood that was as good as mine Im thinking things will continue down this path until something can be done about zero tolerance policies.I'm pretty sure kids always knew this>put into isolation for retrieving his confiscated coat as he was cold\s\sWow what a bunch of cuntsI would be proud as fuck if that was my child.In my school the uniform is like ¬£300 including pe kit and stuff and we have to have a ¬£25 coat aswell. If they were doing it so all the students felt equal (which was their reason) they wouldn't make us pay for any of itA Cheshire school. No surpriseI'm glad there was none of that when I was at school. So long as you had smart shoes and correct uniform no one gave a fuck what coat you wore.When I was in school if they tried to take my coat I just would have gone home. I doubt my parents would have disagreed with me.idk if this is relevent but reminds me of a nightmare school uniform story i haveschool uniforms werent as strickt at mine. needed a jumper+ shirt with the logo on it and pretty much any trousers/shoes that fit the general description of what the school deemed acceptable.I was without school trousers for 5 weeks because 3 of my pair ended up with chewing gum on them within the span of a week. chewing gum doesn't come off- we tried everything.\s\smy mum screamed at the headmaster down the phone for wasting almost 100 pounds worth of (now unusable) trousers because of his unclean school. she couldn't afford trousers for another 5 weeks for me due to money issues we were having.  \s\s\sduring this time-i wasn't allowed to go out because i was 'breaking school uniform rules'. I never told my mum this until the 3rd week as i just couldn't handle not getting at least some outdoor time when in school.  I went home told my parents and they drove straight down to the school to get angry at the head master for punishing me for something that isnt our fault. and this time my dad came to chat with him too- ^((he's harder to get riled up compared to mum so he wasn definitely unhappy.) ).   \s\s\sHe sent us an 'apology' a few days afterwards. the letter wasn't even half a page paper was bent (envelope wasn't) and torn a bit.  they misspelt my name too : ).Honestly should be illegal for schools (state schools anyway) to demand parents buy anything other than blazer/jumper tie and maybe a polo shirt for PE. Why does the rest of it need to be branded other than for academies to turn a bit more profit.Uniforms should be free.The school should give patches to be sewn onto the blazer. I suppose letting them specify a colour is reasonable once they don't go asking for an extremely specific shade (black dark blue wine red should be as specific as it gets).\s\sOf course it's just done so the school can get some funding from the manufacturers which wouldn't be an issue if the government did their jobs.This entire thing (including your comment) is bizarre as someone from a country with no school uniforms except for very few private schools. The only branded clothes I've ever had from a school is a hoodie from a class trip with a small school logo on the front and our own design on the back and a sweatshirt with the same from when I finished trade school. Max ‚Ç¨40 combined and completely voluntary.Uniforms shouldnt exist there is no purpose for themThe uniforms at the religious schools are way worse then the academies around here.Why does any of it need to be branded?My school blazer cost ¬£113 and we were given detentions if we didn't wear themYeah stuff like this was rampant from around 2010 Academies are terrible for it.How else will the head teachers brother in laws auntie run their screenwriting shop?Yes my school/come ‚Äúacademy‚Äù did this too in the 2000s. We didn‚Äôt have branded coats (what a stupid idea) but we weren‚Äôt allowed to wear coats or jackets over our uniform on school grounds. Which meant taking coats off the moment we entered the gates and teachers literally stood there enforcing it.\s\sSeriously; what is the point.I think this is from around that time. The kids had a massive 'sit in' on the playing field at that very school around that time. If this is from now they didn't learn their lesson!Typical Cuntservative moveThe only correct and appropriate response to someone trying to steal your coat when you are cold is a violation of rule 6.Any social workers here? \s\sWould something like this be considered child endangerment / neglect on part of the school?Not sure it would be a social worker issue if it is school policy. I would say it would be a safeguarding complaint that could / should be reported to Ofsted that could trigger an inspection.They are part of the problem tooOur school uniform was only sold by one shop you HAD to buy it from there.\s\sIf you grew out of the branded items you could donate then back to the store and they would be given for free to anyone who the school identified as not being able to afford uniforms.WHAT THE FUCK!?!?This is why I think school uniforms are stupid as fuck.'Put into isolation' if I was a teacher I couldn't deal with doing this to someone.There‚Äôs been enough of a stink kicked up at my kids‚Äô school because they‚Äôve decided to swap grey skirts for green tartan which is only sold at one local uniform shop. And there‚Äôs the alternative of wearing grey trousers. If they tried to pull this bullshit with coats I am certain there would be full scale riots.Needs to be some big crack down on these over zealous Headmasters who act like they are running a royal marine bootcamp \s\sHow many of these types of stories do we hear? Shoes that are too shiny or not shiny enough hair too long or short / wrong colour micro manage every detail other than the work\s\sI guess what it does prepare kids for is these types of people in their working life and how to avoid themMy school literally has rules around 'confiscating' bikes for going against rules that were set in 2020 and even the exact number of stripes that the ties should be at. I'm so glad I'm in year 11 so I can go to college soon and stop pretending to be a 'yoUNg mAN' at somewhere that hasn't been a grammar school for god knows.For some years now it has infuriated me just how much power schools and teachers are given over petty matters that have nothing to do with teaching and how they can dictate so much to families. They seriously need their authority curtailed.\s\sDid you know they also have *legal authority* to put your child in detention outside school hours and as a parent you have no say in that regardless of what your family plans might be? Another example of schools and the petty tyrants that run them having too much power.Abolish school uniforms! All this ""it stops kids from being bullied"" is bullshit. Kids are still being bullied for have 2nd hand or hand me down uniforms as they don't last well and look tattered after 6 months. \s\sUniforms also hamper creativity and individuality. \s\sMy kids were happiest going to school in their own clothes during the pandemic. Surely there is enough evidence around the world that uniforms don't contribute anything helpful. \s\sI'm sick of dreading the new school year and having to find ¬£300+ to clothe two kids in uniforms that they wear for 6m-1yr. I could go to primary and buy loads with that and they would get way more use. \s\sPlus they're itchy ill fitting don't protect much from the weather during the winter and during the summer they aren't great for keeping cool.As an autistic french person i once (as a teenager) accompanied my cousin to buy her uniform and i proceeded to try on several items with the help of my aunt. The shirts felt like plastic (supposedly they would never wrinkle). The seams of trousers and the fabric of skirts were itchy and painful so i barely tried any on and was extremely shocked by the price tags.\s\sI'm glad i was able to wear clothes of my choice to (state) school (in France) since I pick them to be comfortable first.With that title I was expecting a story about molested school boys given how much right-wingers enjoy noncing.Imagine being a teacher and everyday at the end of school you have to help the children find their coat out of 30+ identical coats. \s\sI know you can probably sew a label inside the coat but it's so much easier to have some variety so that the kids can just grab theirs and go.As a TA in a school that isn‚Äôt bat shit insane. I love the parents who send their children to school with like a neon colour with a weird thing on the hood like a unicorn horn or a fake dog hat thing. No misplacing thatfucking toriesYou will\* conform...Even 20 years or so ago my school uniform was incredibly expensive for what it was fuck knows how low income families can manage nowadays.We don't.Asda and eBay mainly. Occasionally charity shops. School have a uniform swap-shop at the end of every year too. We're lucky that my girls' school allows generic unbranded uniform if it didn't we'd be screwed.This was going on at my school years back. One year they decided to ban scarves and winter coats. You weren't allowed to a non reg school scarf. I reckon the wider problem is that schools are chronically underfunded and need more cash.100%. Underfunding + semi-privatisation have ruined the school system which isn‚Äôt saying much tbh. It‚Äôs honestly disgusting that schools feel the need to do this shit whilst Boris and his chums are having lavish Xmas parties and investing billions into authoritarian dictatorships.> schools are chronically underfunded and need more cash.\s\sAs the guy said\s\s> What happens when you let Tories come within 500 yards of a schoolBack in the 70s we had to wear full school uniform (bluecoat school) including caps and blazers with badges each parent was given a list and told where to buy it. These days schools have far more autonomy but little if any oversight.Nothing more pathetic than being a copper except being a school copper bunch of absolute weaponsr/reallyshittycopperHmm this is an interesting one. My mate‚Äôs catholic school did this but the official reason was to foster an environment of equality and to prevent bullying of kids who couldn‚Äôt afford to buy ‚Äúcool‚Äù brands which is obviously a very good thing. \s\sThey did it by simply banning visible logos which is a much better way to do it actuallyBanning branding is one thing enforcing your own brand by taking coats off of children is some whole Dickensian level of evil.I'm not sold on uniforms being a good thing or being a bad thing but uniforms THAT YOU PAY FOR INSTEAD OF BEING ISSUED FOR FREE AT THE INSTITUTIONS EXPENSE are a bad thing.It's the argument that a uniform helps keep all kids equal but when the parents can't afford the uniform then what the fuckI'm in favour of uniforms as long as they're the basic things you can buy at a supermarket. Polo shirts trousers jumper plain shoes etc. Ideally kids wouldn't notice class or it wouldn't be stigmatised but they do and everyone wearing the same thing ever day prevents the poor kid being targeted for having shit clothes. \s\sLogo uniforms available through a supplier with a monopoly? Grim\s\sMy secondary school let anyone wear generic school uniform and any navy hoodie or jumper as long as it didn't have any branding. You could buy one with the school's logo embroidered on it but it wasn't at all required. They also had a shelf in the lost property cupboard where people could drop off/claim second hand uniform and encouraged kids on free school meals to apply for money to cover the cost of shoes/a rusksack/etc if needed. Why that's not the norm baffles mePlot twist the Tories are trying to stop this and brought in a new law last year to force schools to allow high street and non branded uniform - [source](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-make-school-uniform-costs-affordable-for-all)so they arent enforcing it then making it pointless virtue signalling.>the Tories\s\sEvery last one? Not just a couple tories?At my state school in a poor area uniforms cost about ¬£200. Bullshit.Great way to create anti establishment feelings from a young age. How do they expect kids to respect authority when it acts like that. Massive long term own goal ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èKnowing the Tories they‚Äôll blame this whole thing on Labour and distract us all with Corbyn‚Äôs ‚ÄúMao-esque bicycle‚Äù like they did the last time they fucked upmaybe thats the plan?Those staff members are not paid enough to do that.the staff members are complicit for doing it in the first place. theyre teachers they have a fucking union they can make demands on their students behalf.Some people will happily take a pay cut if they get to abuse kids without consequencea.\s\sThose people are called tories.While I think some arguments for the existence of school uniforms make sense this kind of enforcement of specific branded stuff makes me so angry. \s\sKids need to be able to feel comfortable at school. I never did in uniforms I struggled to find stuff that fit. And honestly it was detrimental for my learning and my self-esteem. Clothing can have *such* an impact on how you feel both mentally and physically. And for many kids especially those who are neurodivergent or have certain mental/physical health problems allowing them to wear clothing that causes them the least amount of discomfort should be prioritised over meeting some standard that nobody but the school higher ups even cares about. \s\sA kid shouldn‚Äôt be stripped of their coat in winter because it‚Äôs the wrong kind. A kid shouldn‚Äôt have to miss out on a day of learning because they have the wrong type of shoes or an unbranded jumper. A kid shouldn‚Äôt be made to feel degraded embarrassed or uncomfortable for wearing something that doesn‚Äôt follow unreasonably strict guidelines because situations happen sometimes that are out of a kid‚Äôs control. I remember kids not being allowed to join classes until a family member went out of their way to deliver shoes or a tie because their child had been at grandma‚Äôs and forgot their school shoes and had to do with their regular trainers that day. \s\sUtterly ridiculous.Oh Sorry It took me a second to realise that it said School and Not POW camp/Prison. (/s)\s\sSeriously - What in the Flying F\*ck is this BullSh\*t!  it's **freezing** at the moment and considering that schools have to keep there windows and classroom doors open at the moment Due to COVID (and these Bastards almost certaintly would not have bothered to pay to install central heating in the building) this amounts to essentially **Child abuse**. are they going to say that only ''School Uniform-approved masks are allowed on grounds''.  If the teachers there have any shred of a conciance they should quite or at least go to the govenors board/over the head teacher's head about this.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s**F\*ck this head teacher!** I hope he gets stuck in a Blizzard wearing only a shirt and shorts!If we can‚Äôt make school uniforms free then maybe we should petition to remove all branded uniforms from state schools and academies alike.‚ÄúBut what about Timmy?! He might get bullied because he‚Äôs poor!‚Äù\s\sTimmy‚Äôs already being bullied because he‚Äôs poor! That‚Äôs how school works! But Timmy would be a bit less poor if his mum wasn‚Äôt coerced into forking over ¬£200 a year on shitty school clothes that don‚Äôt fit him and tear after a month or two!\s\sHonestly the whole idea of school uniforms just becomes more and more ridiculous the older I get especially nowadays that office workers are coming in with converse on. Uniforms are dying outside of retail and big-shot corporate office stuff so why we impose them on children is just beyond me. It‚Äôs not like it teaches them anything it just teaches their parents that the ¬£50 they won on the lottery last night is gonna go straight down the drainSend them home or let them wear their coats what kind of fuckwit takes a coat from a child in winter?\s\sAlso wouldn't forcing kids to buy school coats violate the rules for Foundation schools?\s\s[Foundation schools are a kind of ""maintained school"" meaning that they are funded by central government via the local education authority and do not charge fees to students.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_school)\s\sI'm not a brit and never had to wear a uniform but this is fucking mad.When I was in school we only had to buy jumper and polo shirt. Trousers shoes and whatever could be from anywhere. There's deffo been a move in the direction of more expensive and expansive uniforms in recent years.\s\sThere should be a small fee with a cap on all uniform stuff and they should not be able to have literally everything branded. Uniform providers often also totally fuck over schools by charging extortionate amounts.\s\sI'm massively supportive of school uniforms when they're not expensive and students aren't being put in detention for slight violations. I think my school eventually started running an exchange thing where you could hand in uniform you out grew and it could be given to other children extremely cheaply or free.If you want a specific item it needs to be provided at no cost. If you don't want to provide at the cost then it can't be more specific than color/style. PricksThe fuck.the days of having to wear strict uniform should be over - they always say ""oh it prepares you for work""\s\swhat fuckin job requires you to wear a uniform dating back to the 1900s?Also what job forces you to wear a 100 coat that isn't also paying youMy school had a uniform so ""we couldn't tell the poor kids from the not poor kids"". \sYeah.... no.. the poor kids just wore older siblings hand me downs or had a gigantic jumper for 2 years that fit for a year and then was small for another 2 years.As a non-brit  who doesn't have uniforms at their school this is ridiculous to think about. The idea that you MUST wear a school branded uniform that you have to BUY seams like an absolute scam.Well it pretty much is. There is some leeway with things like blazers as you can purchase black blazer and attach fabric school logo on top. But it still costs a lot. To be fair though I only had to buy each piece of uniform once (not the white collar tops but those can be brough without logo usually) throughout the 5 years but others will not be so fortunate. Some people would tear their uniform 5 times per school year.Worked one summer for a uniform company in their warehouse it very much is. Some schools are a pretty standard price but there was this one place in Cumbria where the full panoply would set you back the best part of ¬£300. They even had a white shirt with navy blue buttons just so you couldn't buy a generic pack of ""school shirts"" from a supermarket or whatever. The speed at which some of these wee fuckers are growing some parents were buying multiple uniforms throughout the year too.It's a funny one.  \s\sUniforms help the working class.      \s\sIt's no fun turning up with ragged trousers next to your well-off counterparts. You stick out like a sore thumb and it causes division.    \s\sHowever this only works if the working class can afford the fucking uniform in the first place. It's a good kind idea bastardised by the tories as usual.makes me remember the days of having to buy the school-issue fleeceWho decides that policy?  Is it the school the Governers? The local council?Almost certainly the school>Who decides that policy?\s\sWhoever is getting the kickback from the uniform company.Australia has this problem too the uniform is EXTREMELY expensive you just know the school is in it with the manufacturer and making loads. Books too like Jesus fuck they're expensive.\s\s600-1000 dollars for a set of uniforms is just not okay.> FenrirApalis\s\sI guess it's only appropriate that an Aurailian is giving perspective on Australians.That‚Äôs freedom not available in DPRK.The price of school uniforms are a joke why does school uniform still exist in state schools?I don't think there's anything wrong with a generic school 'uniform' in State schools. E.g. grey/black smart trousers white shirt or polo black shoes or whatever.  The kids are wearing them 5 days a week 30 something weeks a year so whilst those clothes have a cost it'll be cost neutral because you don't need as many other clothes for them.  This kind of stuff is absolutely dirt cheap from Asda or wherever and also because it's generic easy to source in charity shops.\s\sIt's the branded uniform that's a joke. Limited suppliers mean they can charge whatever they want to a captive market it should be outlawed.I remember when I was a kid it was only the school tie that was mandatory and the badges for the blazer which you could sew on at home everything else like trousers shirts and the blazer could be brought from any supermarket. My primary school had its own jumper but you could just wear a plain navy one from Peacocks or where ever if you wanted.\s\sThe school mandating its own coats for all students feels like something only a private school should be doing. Most parents aren't rich enough to happily pay ¬£100+ per child each year for a uniform.\s\sNot to sound excessively old but back in my day you could go to school in a Nirvana hoodie and it would be accepted as outdoor wear when not in lessons. At five I had a blue and yellow PVC rain coat with a picture of a generic cartoon train on one of the front pockets. It was cute and I liked the individual touch it had.\s\sI feel sorry for people trying to raise kids on a budget and have no intention of ever having kids of my own because I know I can't afford to provide a decent enough standard of living for them and I don't want them having a worse time at school then I did. It's bad enough when teenagers are dicks to you but confiscating coats from cold children is just unnecessarily cruel.I attended the school in question and I can tell you this isn‚Äôt even a recent issue. I remember my mum arguing with several members of the senior leadership over this (to no avail) and I left school nearly 7 years ago now.\s\sThe worst part was the mandatory ‚Äòcoats‚Äô nothing more than a light water resistant shell nowhere near fit for purpose as a winter coat. If you wanted a hope in hell of staying warm during winter lunch times you would also need a school branded fleece which would set you back atleast another ¬£20 if memory serves (this being on top of the standard polo shirt and jumper of course) and god forbid you were caught standing in the corridors to stay warm during lunch.\s\sPersonally I think the stated ¬£100 is a massive underestimate by the time you consider you consider the tartan skirts (which are of course only available from the schools designated uniform retailer rather than a standard skirt you can get from Asda) and mandatory 2 set of PE kit (indoors and outdoors) again all of which was branded including shorts and socks.What dog üí© school is this?Second paragraph‚Ä¶‚ÄòKick backs‚Äô to the governors for every uniform purchased.If I had weans and some oul boy told him to take his coat off he'd get teeth kicked in. Jesus Christ.What[removed]for warmth.Are there no workhouses?Many would not go there many would rather die!\s\sFuck can't believe I've got to use that line twice in as many days. We're fucked aren't we?Is this a private school thing or something? I cant imagine regular schools doing this.Regular academy schools protect their profits.If they want children to wear uniforms the school should provide them.from what i understand private schools in my country allow you to wear non-uniform coats and you can use jeans instead of the school's pants so this thing in Britain is fucking shiteAh yes but a mask mandate is inhumaneAnd impossible to enforce! /s[deleted]Same vibe as US schools confiscating inhalers from asthmatic students and letting them die so they get a sense of power over children.   \s\s\sThe coat thing? Power over kids. Uniforms? Has some ups and downs but it's a system to put even more power over kids. Why? Let them have some form of self expression.I remember a kid who shaved his head for a charity event wasn't allowed to enter school again until it was longer than a grade 2 otherwise he was breaching school uniform policy...\s\sNot to mention when I was in school girls weren't allowed to wear trousers at all only skirts. Anyone in violation of the policy here would be forced to wear a large and purposefully embarrassing pleated skirt as punishment. I hope it has changed since I was last there. \s\sSchool uniform is fine if the policy is reasonable IMO and certainly has many benefits but to take children out of education or force embarrassing clothes on to those in breach of policy is just a petty authority play by pathetic adults.I‚Äôm a lil on the fence about uniforms they also serve the purpose of leveling the playing field of clothing at schools. Poor kids and rich kids have to wear the same uniform so kids don‚Äôt have as much to zero in on class wise. I think the idea of school uniforms isn‚Äôt actually that bad if the uniforms are provided to the students. I agree though they do provide another avenue for shitty adults to exercise power over kidsThat's really infuriating taking clothes from *children* especially in cold weatherThis is when your children begin to fight back.This is nothing to do with Tories I went to this school 12 years ago it was always a strict and cruel place for teenage students. Their ruleset was always terrible the focus of the school was always more money higher budget yet their facilities were constantly breaking down falling apart missing equipment. The school has always been well funded and given opportunities to improve facilities but the heaaster David Curry is some kind of businessman stuck in education im genuinely having a hard time expressing myself with this because of the fucking rage I still hold from having to attend this absolute nightmare of a school. If your aim in life from 10 years old is to be a plain boring cunt sat in an office judging yourself by accademic and economic value then great enjoy if you are any of the other millions of characters a person could develop into good fucking luck in that school.1984I went to school in 1984 and it wasn't as bad as this shit\>One mum said her asthmatic son was put Into  \sisolation for retrieving his confiscated coat as he  \swas cold\s\sOne mum should have told her son not to comply with someone just because they are in a position of authority.He didn't comply - his coat was confiscated he took it back anyway (as he should) and then he was punished further.Sometimes you've got to take a deep breathe and get on with it.I'd make a velcro bad to stick on any item of clothing or a custom tshirt plastered with the school logoIt just shows what idiots these people are. The childrens safety/welfare ALWAYS comes first. If they don't have a branded anorak PROVIDE THEM WITH ONE or abandon that idiotic rule.how can you both charge for a uniform and make it mandatory? that seems like 2 things that only should be allowed to be done separatelyWtf is wrong with peopleI knew privatising schools would be the worst decision the Tories ever made when it came to education but I didn‚Äôt think it would be this bad! Could you imagine forcing small children to stand outside without a coat in this current horrible bitter weather just so that their parents have to fork over the ¬£30 for a shitty school branded one that‚Äôs definitely either way too thick or way too thin to be useful throughout the entire autumn/winter period?! It‚Äôs honestly disgustingUnfortunately I can imagine it as I attended the school in question. This isn‚Äôt a new issue either I remember my mum arguing with several members of the senior leadership over this (to no avail) and I left school nearly 7 years ago now. \s\sThe worst part was the mandatory ‚Äòcoats‚Äô nothing more than a light water resistant shell nowhere near fit for purpose as a winter coat.

The state school that I attended in the90s required that we wore a particular type of coat or at a push a navy coat. I had neither and no money so I used to fucking freeze in the northern Irish winters.Do people who work in shops wear uniforms? Generally not although in the case of places like DIY stores where there's heavy lifting potential for getting a bit dirty then yes uniforms a good idea. people in offices generally no.\s\sIn the adult world of work most workplaces specify what's called 'business casual' and this is what schools should have. A dress code not a uniform.\s\sTrousers shorts or skirt ( no jeans) shirt with collar or smart polo shirt sweater shoes or boots (no trainers)\s\sIn Europe school uniform is largely unheard of however the schools are very strict about what cannot be worn. Ripped jeans booty shorts hooded tops mini / micro skirts low cut tops\s\sI think the British obsession with school uniform stems from a class fantasy that people want to pretend the school is some posh snob school instead of a state institution.It's all part of the hidden cariculum. They want everyone to look the same. Schools are partly there to teach children to conform and do what you are toldWhen your private school tuition doesn't even cover the god damn uniform.I like the idea of a uniform for my kids. It is an extra cost but if they allowed for non branded stuff it will be affordable keep your kids 'home' clothes safe from damage and ensure all kids look the same to avoid bullying for being poor etc. \s\sJust a pair of black shoes black or grey trousers solid colour polo shirt and solid colour jumper. Available either from the school or most supermarkets barring the particular colour if jumper.\s\sIf I found out one of my sons was in trouble for hitting that teacher he would more likely face reward than punishment.Teachers should have to wear uniforms I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt most occupations have a uniform.My old boss was a secondary school teacher in the 90s. The head started proposing stricter uniform rules and my boss said fine- how about all staff follow the same rules then to set the example? Who's willing? And not one of them would agree. He called them all hypocritesOr‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt force kids to wear uniforms.We do have a strict dress code tbf but I get your point. Problem is different teachers in different oars of the school need different apparel based on what challenges they‚Äôd be facing. Easier to just let the staff pick out what they need I supposeMost occupations don't have a uniform.Teachers do have a uniform like literally every other job.This was my school. It would cost around $100 for an anorak (70USD) (52GBP) (also it wasn't even waterproof). If you were seen wearing another brand or showed up wet to class detention. They'd also change the uniform style every 2 years so that students had to buy a new one every time.Yeah can imagine there cabinet in their evil lair Borris sitting with a skull cap on and white cat on his knee. ‚ÄúWhat evil deeds can we unleash on the British public today dear Tories?‚Äùif this was being done in a school my child was attending id show up to a parent teacher conference and assault the head teacher.OkThey should be publicly executed for taking coats from children. The punishment should fit the crime.Are you alright?Put them in the stocks.TL;DR Jesus Christ these types of schools give Uniforms bad names. \s\sI went to a uniform wearing secondary school the rule were quite fluid but had hard limits. The coat for us only had to be black or a dark colour no other rules. After about year 11 most teachers bar 2 or 3 genuinely cared about uniform rules past don't wear a hoodie. I got away with wrong coloured socks so many times in my last two years. \s\sI can see why some people don't like uniforms but I like uniforms. It gives a sense of order sometimes pride to students. It means that in most cases people don't try to one up each other in clothing or discriminate based on lack of ""good"" clothes. \s\sA good school uniform should be flexible and be appropriate for weather conditions. I live in a temperate climate very rarely does it go under 14C or over 25C so shorts and trousers both work for us. Sorry for the rantI have to ask why do you like school uniforms? I live in Sweden where school uniforms are completely absent and when I was a student I was very happy that I didn't live in a country where student uniforms was a norm.\s\sI know there were some students who wanted them but from my perspective it just seemed like they wanted it because they had seen them in English language media and that they were the kind of people who had some sort of fetishistic adoration for anything American or British.\s\sTo me they just seemed like another way of culturally ingraining hierarchy and authority on students. The school curriculum in Sweden has the explicit task of teaching students to become democratic members of society and to me school uniforms seem to just achieve the opposite.But I don't want to wear a fucking uniform as a student! I am not a cop or in the military I am in a school for children...They should be lawyered into oblivion.Only the kids with no lives and a stupid dedication their school will have pride in it. School is for education and whenever people leave their school they always realise they don‚Äôt actually give two shits about it.Pedophiles trying to undress children as policy.have a day off.They‚Äôre acting like this isn‚Äôt a normal thing that happens in schools.\s\sEdit: I guess I just went to a dodgy school lolThey act like its not normal to make a child cold so you can force them to buy merchandise! how stupid!It isn't  and even if it is it's still bad.This is extremely common in secondary schools in Ireland.Reminds me of a private Baptist school I went to as a kid in Texas. You could only wear dark blue polo shirts and khaki slacks from a single store 70 miles away. If you wore anything other than that brand you'd get demerits and sent home if possible otherwise to detention. The shirts and pants were ludicrously overpriced at around $50 each.I understand i didn‚Äôt have a normal upbringing but has one of these students not beat the shit out of someone trying to confiscate their coat?[removed]Actually you can‚Äôt point the finger at the tories. Policies like this are aimed at appearances to look like a school where the kids behave and they are all desirable types. \s\sWhy? Because education reform has attempted to make schools free markets. Schools get funding based on pupil numbers so schools have spent the last decade trying to attract customers (parents who choose where to send their kids)I believe the title is something of a joke as this sub does tend to focus on the Tories a lot. It is not implying a causal link but pointing out how similar these disgusting actions are to what a money-grabbing Tory elitist would do‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs very in character. \s\sIn your anger I think you might have missed that possibility. But then again you were in quite the rush to get the ad hominem attacks underway‚Ä¶bigoted.... against tories...it‚Äôs clearly a joke pointing fun at the Tories blatant classism and their distinct knack for overcharging the public and then punishing them for not being able to afford it.\s\sOh you want to be able to vote?

One way you pay thousands which gives you equity and the opportunity to gain from house price increases.  The other you pay thousands and you walk away with nothing.I disagree.

So that‚Äôs cheery.Jesus I just did the calculations and me and my partner have paid over $200k (which is over ¬£150k) and we only have about $40k in savings which is maybe a third of what we‚Äôd need for a down payment in a very small home where we live.man that sucks but at least you can hug it out nowIt's not the rent that is the hard part. It's the initial down payment.  \s\s\sI'm paying off all my own debts in order to start looking at houses in about 2 years time.Except when the land\*\*\*\*\* has already paid off the mortgage then we are just giving them money for the right to exist in a 3 dimensional space surrounded by building materials which belong to themMy idea to fix this problem is to force landlords to give 1% equity for each year that they live in the unit.  - if the tenant moves the landlord has to pay them that amount. Incentive to keep tenants and maintain the property. Then the tenant can have wnough for a downpayment when they move.\s\sRent to own should be the law. \s\sStupid responses i get to this idea is ‚Äúbut the landlord will just increase the rent!‚Äù Stupitards.But what would be the motivation to rent out your property then? Why would you bother to rent out your property if you know you will not make money?\s\sAs good as that sounds in theory the reality is that fewer homes will be available for rent if that were the case.This is a problem with how the government is run to allow for such a system to exist. The landlords we pay rent to play the same game we do and just happened to have invested in a home to rent out.They play the same game except with 500k free spawn cashThe game is rigged. The real owners won‚Äôt let this change. Our monetary system sets us up where one layer dominates the layer below it through debt. In certain situations the renters are better off.

The people commenting here don‚Äôt see owning vs renting property as a function of risk and return. I personally could own a home but the risks outweigh the reward for me so I choose to rent. People think renting is wrong or objectively worse than home ownership because they lack understanding of risk return and opportunity cost.That was exactly my first thought. What exactly is keeping them from doing it too? Most houses aren‚Äôt even bought straight cash (moreover people that could do so take a loan anyways given the low interest rates to eliminate inflation risks one of many a homeowner has as you correctly pointed out).\sBut seeing the downvotes you get for asking a very valid and objective question shows who you are talking to here...You might not want to state that you are a straw buyer on here.

International Women‚Äôs Day was chosen on the date selected by the American Socialist Party. They need to learn their heritage and how to fight and win again.

When air traffic controllers were striking under Reagan for better pay they were all simply fired.  Government employes are made aware of this when hired and it is to prevent from an outright collapse in situations like this.The one thing about this time is there's no way they could replace the strikers while the government is shut down.

But those schools are quite small and not in the UC system but their newer CU system or whatever. In fact one of them is a client of mine and is quite manageable :PI mean I might argue that this *might* be weak evidence if - for example - the majority of universities were already built (universities usually being historical monuments too) and so there was a different """"""need"""""" for prisons (as there were already universities). This is just a supposition as I don't know the figures or history. Just raising the point that how many were built in that time doesn't reflect how many universities and prisons already existed amongst other things. My point ultimately being; the message that the priorities are wrong is undoubtedly correct but I'd also like to see more evidence to bring to light if these figures are as damning as they might first seem.Additionally old prisons eventually get torn down or repurposed which never happens to universities. And if there is an increase in students a university can grow by adding more buildings which is much harder to do with prisons.\sI think there are way more convincing statistics you can pull out.And they all make way more money than anyone with even the weakest moral compass would find acceptableLand of the Free California loves to play the progressive card yet 10% of the nation‚Äôs prison population is in California!Sucks that wages are literally just slavery with more steps but go off I guess.I mean to be fair Americans couldn‚Äôt afford the colleges anyway. \s\sGod I hate my country.Thats fucking rich coming from an authoritarian.This is a liberal wannabe socialist haven after all.Post says tankie post history says fashIf people would just quit breaking the law...""THe laW mAkeS mE mOIsT.""[deleted]Calm down.\s\sThis is an anarchism subreddit.

California has seen a double in population since 1970 meaning a double in the amount of institutions would be needed in general.  However a 400% rise in state funding spent on prisons has been seen since 1970 whereas state funding for college campuses has only increased by approximately 50%.\s\sAs a result California has placed a disproportionate amount of resources towards prisons as opposed to higher education in recent years.  Consider the war on drugs and the commercialization of its prison system and you might get an idea why prisons are so popular.  \s\sThe politicians are lobbied by those who benefit from more prisoners (the private companies using prisoners as slave labor).  The politicians benefit from a ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù tactic the more fear arises in a population.  The media has been foaming at the mouth spreading fear ever since the 1980s (coincidentally at the time when the FCC fairness doctrine was revoked).\s\sIn other words those in power have set forth their agenda to further consolidate wealth within their pockets despite the adverse social/economic effects it may have on the population.

They're pretty happy with things the way they are and wouldn't want to lose any of their unacknowledged privilege.Well for one civility is subjective. I would say that all of this excepting bombing people was very civil. Sure it was disruptive and protests / demonstrations are meant to be but also peaceful and civil. And there were very very very few incidents of violence in the suffrage movement so its revisionist history to suggest suffrage was only possible because of violent acts. Now if someone else wants to say that protesting is uncivil or objects to protesting because they see it as uncivil I'd disagree with that premise and the conclusion. But I would also caution against turning to violence and abandoning civility as if it will contribute to helping this cause.The definition of ""uncivil"" has changed in the US. Nowadays it means ""anything that inconveniences me in any way.""While I understand that a person may carry their own definition of ""civil"" I can't agree that these examples of protests fall within that definition. That's not to say that the examples provided are bad but rather to point out that in some way protests aren't about being polite and courteous. Disruption by physically blocking people shouting loud chants bombing and everything else in between is about making a scene and in some way or another fucking things up. It's not courteous because you're actively being inconsiderate to their day and their agenda and that's the point. Polite protests are imo an oxymoron.[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ3JP4na6Cs) [this](https://streamable.com/y4zv0r) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE3eMEtMTpY) is civil?So...protests can work in DC. Really convenient for a country that‚Äôs millions of square miles.Hmm. Let's rephrase that to make it more civil. ""Civility on works if both party's follow it and adhere to the rules."" I don't think beating kneeling on someone's neck is very civil do you?Actually I think all those actions were very civil. And the actions taken now are very civil. I'm impressed with the protestors. The only violence seems to occur when right wingers go to stir trouble or when the police become aggressive.\s\sOtherwise they're doing a great job. I hope these protests keep happening regardless who wins the election. I want em going straight for four years minimumBombings are... civil?\s\swutI‚Äôve seen violent protesters jumping on cars destroying things and harassing people sitting eating dinner completely unprovoked. I appreciate us non-violent protestors for the stand we‚Äôre taking but I would like everyone to reel in those looking to instigate or destroy things unprovoked. It distracts from the message and the reason we‚Äôre protesting to begin with.I don't have Vivian's faith in demonstrations. I also think she is assuming that correlation is causation.  For just one example JFK was told he would not win the Presidency unless he got the black vote.  http://archive.oah.org/special-issues/teaching/2008_12/article.pdf\s\sIMO that had more to do with the Civil Rights Act that JFK began and LBJ got passed than any demonstration.  However I do believe that the March on Washington scared some folks as well. Today what with Homeland Security NSA militarized police etc. I think they'd be a lot less scared of popular uprisings than they were then.These movements all didn‚Äôt burn and loot their own communities. Stop justifying political violence because America has rejected your ideasLmao violence is when you break a Wendy‚Äôs. But cops shooting out peoples eyes is cool üòé**Most of the time** civility is anything but bullshit; you have to target your ""incivility"" with *precision* and ***intelligence***.

Gee tough call. I guess it depends on if your worldview is *solve* problems or just ""law and order.""You can continue to pay cops to continue their ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù jobs to ensure that these homeless shelters remain drug and violence free  safe homes for the most vulnerable population. Win/WinWhat boggles my mind is that we have over 4000 Universities in the U.S. and the majority of them have Economics and Social Science PhD Professors (let's say at least 2 per for a total of 8000) and we can't use this brainpower and talent to figure this homeless issue out?Gee think of what we could do if we just diverted some of the money we spend killing people in other countries to doing something constructive for our own citizens? That would be a win for us and a win for those people we would otherwise be killing.I think Finland or one of the Nordics managed to eliminate homelessness in the past year or three...Excellent.All the democrats need to do is say that they will not do the things that trump is doing. They refused to say that period they saw at trump is doing and instead of feeling that it was abhorrent felt that it was something it they deserved to be able to do.Is this the same dude that constantly changes his opinion on Twitter?I don't give a crap about Cruz's taking a trip. I do give a crap about all the time off Congress gives itself and the little to no good it does when it is in session and how much money they and their staff cost us.Reminds me of dems and Republicans taking a week recess after this failed impeachment instead of working on covid stimulus relief. 4 years of dunking on Trump and not a lot of talk or energy pushing for policy that is overwhelmingly popular among Democrats and popular among most Americans. It's almost as if those who are in charge of the dem party have an anti-progressive agenda just like those in charge of the Republican party. Both groups - tools of the oligarchy and ruling elite.If you really think about it is this guy that much different than the rest of the turds in DC?\s\sThe country is burning and they are working to figure out ways to keep Trump from running in 2024. Fucking priorities are messed up. They are COMPLETELY detached from the country and it is infuriating.or trying to ban Trump from being buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

There are very rarely repercussions.\s\s***I've*** lost respect for Americans why should the people milking you have any?As an American you're absolutely right. We're a spineless populous who refuses to stand up for ourselves even when one half of our ruling pro-corporate party even argued in court that they have the right to commit election fraud. \s\sThey point blank admitted it and we sit here and take it.

BTW don't forget About Fredo's Brother in NYC.I think Ted Cruz is an absolutely rotten cunt... but this whole story is the same bullshit when the party out of power blames the President for golfing or going on vacation. It's just petty and pointless. Especially if he's had this planned for a while now. \s\sI'm right there with you if you say it's bullshit that Congress gets so much time off or that they get paid way too much... But even assholes like Ted Cruz are allowed to take a fucking family vacation.No it wasn't planned for a while. They lost power in their house in Houston and decided hey we're rich let's jet off to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun and let the poors deal with the collapse of the electric grid! \s\sThen Cancun Cruz tried to pretend that he was just escorting his daughters as if he didn't want them to fly unaccompanied.

His something or other might get damaged if they don't restore power immediately!This is not a good argument not at all.At least Ted's hot air could have warmed things up a bit.Creative argument I'll give you that. Send it to Cruz he'll use it. His ""I was only going along to accompany my kids who would otherwise have had to fly alone"" excuse didn't go over so well once it was established that his wife was on the trip too. \s\sWhile you're thinking up excuses think up one for the fact he left the family dog behind in an unheated house.Flights to Cancun were about $100 per person when he went. Not exactly a luxury trip he was taking.\s\sIt's not like he was one of the dozens of democrats who have spent the year crying about lockdowns only to go on full expensive vacations themselves. He at least wasn't a hypocrite telling people to stay home while he went out.\s\sHe's a senator without much real power within the state that isn't being a part of the senate. I'm not sure what the average person thinks he in particular can do about problems that have nothing to do with him.\s\sWas it the ""right"" thing to do in a crisis? No. But it wasn't setting babies on fire either. He like tens of thousands of other Texans decided to leave somewhere nicer while they could. But I don't hear anyone screaming about them. Nor do I remember much mainstream condemnation for all the nonsense the dems have done during Covid ranging from tropical vacations and packed family dinners and indoor dining.\s\sJust more media bias and extreme prejudice from the left for anyone who doesn't have a (D) in their title. Gotta pretend that this is a big deal so they can complain about it for YEARS.

When are people going to question why they even exist?\s\sThe MSM is part of the problem. They hammer covid deaths all day long but brush off the half a million opioid deaths.More opioid(specifically) deaths in the last 2-3 years than the past 70 of US involved military conflict combined but you won‚Äôt hear them say it.I thought about that too...homeless and drug overdoses are at least half as serious as covid in terms of deaths and getting sick. Yet we don't shut down the country to try to help these people.\s\sI've lost more friends to opoid ODs and addiction than I have to Covid. Ironically a lot of the deaths come from fentalyal from China too. \s\sI have no problem with soft drugs but anyone selling fentalyal is basically selling death and a serious sentence is needed so people know that is not tolerated.And if anyone befriends these groups and starts builiding a following a council of elders will meet behind closed doors and decide his/her fate. First they attempt to delegitimize them. They are a fraud they claim to speak for the Almighty they socialize with prostitutes and convicts.\s\sWhen that fails they attempt to trap them or incite violence. When all else fails they are arrested for disturbing the peace poisoning the youth working as a spy for an enemy etc. Then they are convicted behind closed doors and decided if they will be executed openly in public as a grand message or in prison as a quieter message.\s\sSame as it ever was.Never underestimate the power of ‚ÄúNo U‚ÄùThey criminalize people to exploit them via slave prison labor.how many times can i say i hate it here because i *hate* it hereAnd to make sure that for profit prisons stay profitable. \s\sOf course there are goodies for cooperative people on the prosecution side too. Some judges have even been convicted of being too good about providing for profits prisons with customers.They criminalise the homeless and drug addicts and the poor so they don't have to admit the systemic and generational layers of trauma patterns which begin in childhood that are the root-cause of it all make it stop stop participating in it and benefitting from it themselves  and then treat all of it.Is there a reason these posts never link to the original tweet?\s\shttps://twitter.com/Lwrathofkhan/status/1269301459008585734Tell ‚Äòem Laila!And then they DE-criminalized corruption so THEY don‚Äôt have to go to jail!Homelessness isn't criminalized.  Neither is drug addiction or being poor.  This tweet is a bunch of drivel.you never heard of a homeless person getting a ticket they can't afford for living on the streets when there is nowhere else to go? \s\sYou know some places still arrest people for drug possession?\s\sThis tweet is not drivel your response is.They did not mean it in the most literal/direct legal way. They meant that they spread a culture of paranoia dehumanization and antipathy towards these groups (make society think of them as ""a bunch of bad people and criminals"") then exploit that culture to normalize all kinds of abuse and sweep it under the rug.\s\sPolice shoot black man? ""It's okay he was ***probably*** trying to steal something or murder someone.""\s\sHomeless person gets randomly killed? ""Serves them right for being such a lazy bum. They probably were a dangerous person anyway.""\s\sPoor people suffering from their poverty? ""If God loved them he would've given them money. They're probably bad and dangerous people anyway. Also is it ***our*** fault that they are incompetent and/or stupid?""\s\sBy having this culture of dehumanization antipathy and tending to easily lump certain groups of people with ""criminals"" or ""dangerous people"" or whatever the hell is the latest thing the abusive continue to be abusive and the indifferent continue to be indifferent.

They know better. They've all been briefed on it extensively. It's not about affordability.... It's about giving their donors what they want.This is wrong in so many ways. Neoliberals aren't hoping sustainable energy sources will be profitable because they already *are* more profitable than fossil fuels. What they're doing is 'hoping' companies will invest in renewable energy and move away from fossil fuels.\s\sThe problem is that the market strategy is too slow because fossil fuel companies don't have incentive to transition to sustainable energy as quickly as they need to if they're guaranteed to have the largest share in the sustainable energy sector once they do anyway. From a business perspective it just makes more sense to sell both instead of one or the other.Isn't the definition of Neoliberal mean RepublicanAs of the present the neo-lib establishment is the driving political force behind the 'fight climate change' agenda.And the ""fight climate change"" agenda they're pushing is ""do essentially nothing and hope it becomes profitable to fight climate change""Except for the part where they're all bought out by big oil and they're giving huge subsidies to fossil fuel companies.No they have introduced regulations and younger neolibs are pushing for a carbon tax.Neo-Liberals and regulation.

It is corporate greed tryin to stop people from getting free product and make them go into the store.

One COULD argue that the dumpster is private property and thus one rummaging through it could be a liability but then wouldn't you need to argue that police should be used to protect all dumpsters? People have been known to rummage through game store dumpsters for old systems and games and you don't see the cops patrolling those dumpsters.Yes big corporation lines the pockets of politicians who make laws to prevent this.The store threw out this food because it was out of date and they had a power outage so said the store.  They are worried that they will be sued if someone got sick from this food.  I have eaten food beyond it's expiration date many many times and the food is still good.  I've even opened milk a week or so past the expiration date and it was good for about a week then it started to sour.  I've eaten yogurt that was months past the expiration date and it was still fine.  They were not throwing out this food in the middle of a heat wave it was freezing cold so the food should have still been good.  \sI understand why the store threw out the food their insurance will cover the loss.  What I don't understand is why they called the police a number of times.  People who aren't desperate for food wouldn't go 'shopping' for food in a dumpster.  Fred Meyer got roasted for calling the cops and after a while the cops left and some activists sorted through the food to determine if it was still good and gave the food to various kitchens around the city to feed those who are staying in community centers out of the cold.Food expiration dates have nothing to do with edibility.  They're completely unregulated and in many cases they're intentionally wayyy to short to get people to throw out edible food so they'll buy more.  Particularly things like Yogurt Cheese and Salami foods made specifically to last months or years will have ridiculous dates of like 2 weeks past production.\s\sI used to work at a gas station and for lunch and dinner we always were eating things that were past their date and supposed to be ""trashed.""  None of us ever got sick.if they gave them for free then no one would buy them next time.

It's an emergency.  The function of the government is to help the people not keep food out of their hands and then do fuck all else.There are laws to protect places from being sued for giving away food you clown.

If everyone's pay goes up so does the cost of goods and services they provide.  We likely end up paying a lot more for everyday services and it makes it increasingly more lucrative for companies to outsource labor to poor countries or simply invest in automation where possible.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sAt face value more than doubling federal minimum wage from $7.25/hr to $15/hr seems like it will solve all the problems of the poor. I think it is important to discuss potential negative consequences of such a drastic change.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sAnyone have any solutions to an increase in minimum wage playing out like this?They should just feel lucky that we aren't asking for the $19/h it would be if it had progressed at the same rate as productivityActually I think it is more like $23 an hour.

They are classified as essential in many states.The problem with increasing wages is companies like this will just hire fewer people for the same amount of work. It‚Äôs really just a lose lose either way.Increasing wages may actually create more job openings even if it decreases the total number of jobs due to the fact that one person would no longer need 3 jobs to survive and likely wont continue to work 3 jobs because of how miserable it is.Oh look it's Nazi trash.\s\sPosts in PDPsubmissions thinks BLM has been burning the country to the ground for months yep that's a Nazi.\s\sTell me how triggered were you when you lost our Parler account when Bezos said fuck that site?\s\sThe only good thing Bezos did in years.‚ÄúThe problem with feeding the poor is that it will just incentivize them to have children.‚ÄùThey can‚Äôt as they need the staff to keep running at the same rates.

So Donald Trump's people squeeze out Democrats in Florida while Joe Biden's people inflate turnout in Pennsylvania because California and Texas don't really matter no matter how many people vote there.\s\s> USA has fake elections \s\sThe decentralized nature of the election system means you've got hundreds of little voting-fiefs in the form of counties.  And control of county offices decide who runs the states which in turn decides who represents the local public at the federal level.\s\sBut who holds office at the county level is decided through a complex game of public engagement propaganda and mobilization.  It isn't as simple as saying ""The Deep State Hobogoblins decide the President"".  If that were true Bush Sr never would have lost to Clinton and Trump would have been just another also-ran in the Ted Cruz v Hillary Clinton grudge match of 2016.I watched and I see several problems with the arguments in the video. Most importantly they admit that the hand recount was done from a human tally of scanned ballot images and paper ballots. Why did the recount closely match the Dominion server results? This alone invalidates their arguments about not just the decrements supposedly observed in releases from the Dominion server but also for some precincts skewing towards 90-95+% Democratic votes. Swings that wide by neighborhood are not uncommon in areas with historical and lingering segregation.\s\sFurthermore if decrements occurred in public data why was that information not included in court filings? I suspect it is because there were some SD cards with missing or incorrect precinct labels that someone had to correct manually (by subtracting identical numbers and preferences of votes from one precinct and adding them to another) after they had been read into the Dominion server and therefore prematurely reported in the time series. That explains the one county official saying they had to adjudicate a majority of their votes: sd cards with wrong source information. Given that SD cards are homogeneous it's easy to make that kind of a mistake. But after they were entered a subsequent step I surmise is to compare the written label which is likely to be correct because the precinct workers wrote on them to the stored data which probably came from a machine that thought it was in the wrong precinct.If the Dem party had put Bernie on the ticket in 2016 instead of Hillary who sided with big donors and elites how different things would be today.  they won‚Äôt allow someone on the side of the people to have power.keep fantasizing that it is about the Tsar knowing what the People know.\s\she would have been more isolated/insulated than tRUMP or Carter.  we would have had four years of media raving about ""communism"" instead of ""fascism"" and deliberately misconstruing every utterance that Bernie made.\s\sif you don't understand that the Prez is a puppet position merely to rubber stamp vested interests and continue the Washington Consensus i don't know what to tell you.Nothing will fundamentally change.The flaw with this logic is thinking that we can vote our way out of this mess.

We form cooperative people-owned non-Wall Street companies to go head to head with every company funding the rigged US system.  We only buy from people-owned Berniecrat companies. We take all the talent nationwide and we form our own companies.  We keep our own profit.  We only stay at hotels we own.  We only buy from grocery stores that we own.  We only buy vegetables fruit and products from companies we own.  We form our own banks and insurance companies and only buy from ourselves.  We ice the bribers and kleptocrats out. We crash their money train.  Losing just 15% of customers can cripple some companies and erase their profit.  We have the power to end them.  It‚Äôs time to wield our money like a sword and cut off their heads.  Then we buy their stuff at pennies on the dollar when the briber companies fail.\s\s#2 We go head to head with our people or groups of candidates in every every election nationwide.  We target and get rid of the most conservative /moderate / neo liberal Democrats first.  We bleed them dry.  We attack relentlessly with people power. We force them to spend every dollar they‚Äôve got. We exhaust them.  We grind them to dust.  We‚Äôll win some and lose some and never stop until we get rid of all of them.\s\s#3 Then we use the corporate tax code to our own benefit.So much for being able to afford the treatment for my sexlexia.Wait till you hear about the scam of politicians pretending to be progressive and promising tangible changes only to do the exact opposite once elected. \s\sThis scam is so egregious they actually get you to work for them for free and you end up with no tangible benefit. \s\sYou campaign for them donate money and vote and then they don‚Äôt even attempt to deliver on anything that inspired you to work to get them elected in the first place. \s\sYou‚Äôre out money time and spirit and all your neighbors are super pissed off at you because you personally promised them $2000 checks on that politician‚Äôs behalf if they voted for him and the fucker isn‚Äôt paying up.\s\sDon‚Äôt fall for this crap guys.But...muh democrats!

According to Warren she left the Republican Party because it is no longer ""principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets"" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.\s\sAnd now she's a shining example the Third Way neoliberal technocracy Bill and the DLC turned the Democrats into by competing for the corporate dollars that up till then were exclusively earmarked for the corporate whores of the Republican party.It's okay she'll be rewarded with a lobbyist job or serve on Netflix's board in a few years...That picture is fucking hilarious like she's weakly punching the flag mumbling ""why america why dont you want me!?""Sssssssnakeüêçüêçüêçüêç üêç üêçPeople on the joe Biden reddit are saying shit like ‚Äújust ignore people talking about her bad past.

These people are our enemies and will never allow anything remotely leftist to pass.The enemy of my enemy can still be my enemy whilst being my friend.\s\sKamala/Biden/Warren are all obstacles in the way of progress.

This does not give them a free pass from ridicule and criticism let alone throwing their own history in the air to let the shit smell air out.Sorry about the others we're all still very upset about how the primaries have turned out.

If y'all don't want to vote for Biden that's totally your right. But when you vote third party and Trump wins again because you couldn't accept anything but perfection don't come crying to me.Metaphor. Referring more to attitude than profession.\s\sFor instance Does the wiki about how she sent parents to prison for ‚Äútruancy‚Äù when their children had severe and life-threatening chronic illnesses?Her wiki page has been sanitized. We saw the same thing happen to the media bias against Bernie Sanders page. I see people all over the politics and news thread linking her wikipage and another page showing how she ranks as one of the top progressive dems. Okay this supports the narrative that the party isn't a left wing party and it also ignores her poor criminal justice track record.Yes the person in charge of PROSECUTING crimes is a cop.

When you ain't got nothin' you got nothin' to lose.Yeah for most of my adult lifeThe backstabbing is a deliberate part of the strategy. That way liberals can be defensive and say to the left ""You need to grow up and realize that you can't get 100% of what you want"" when Dems fail to fight for anything and ""Dems had to support bad legislation because they don't have the votes"" when Dems capitulate to the Republicans. We've seen it constantly for the last 30 years. These arguments are specifically designed to make the left seem unreasonable while the neolib ""center"" is portrayed as pragmatic. So we get nothing the Republicans get 75% of what they want and billionaires and multinational corporations get 100%. \s\sThe problem with voting for Dems is that they lie and make it seem like they want what you want but when you actually look at their record they are antithetical to a leftist policy agenda and actively work to suppress it. Look at all that bullshit Biden said during the election and compare that to his cabinet appointments and how much he's backtracked on a whole host of issues. He will even refuse to do the things that he doesn't need Congress' help on like reducing student debt which could be done with an executive order. Dems like to spout the line that we need to be satisfied with incremental progress and that change is slow but it's all bullshit designed to placate you and convince you that you shouldn't be demanding more from the government that claims to be on your side.I wish this comment was on the frontpage of political reddit. Encapsulates exactly what I think a lot of us feel.I don't disagree other than the ""what Biden said"" part.  Obama legitimately ran on a ""hope and change"" ""we'll stop the rise of the oceans"" ""everyone benefits when we spread the wealth around"" agenda before doing almost nothing bold or Leftwing as president.  Biden's agenda was largely two things--""Return us to some lesser iteration of Obama ca. 2014"" and ""Not Be Trump.""  There was no way he was ever going to push a spate of systemically significant Leftist policies and he never really gave an impression otherwise.  Like Obama Biden thinks that his Center Right corporate policy IS Progressive and everything to his Left is ""how are we gonna pay for it"" and ""The American People aren't there yet man.""  \s\sThe Left very largely voted for Biden this time full-well knowing that he was the second or third most Rightwing candidate in the Democratic field that he valued working with Republicans as his primary m.o. above any preference for policy.  The Left wasn't duped this time or robbed.  It was either frightened and disgusted by Republican fascism enough to not go scorched-Earth against Biden or it's just too small to be able to win a primary against the entire Establishment at this stage.  Either way it has to massively build and probably change quite a few strategies in order to prepare for 2028 when we'll have an even bigger fight over the future of the country and the planet as now and when the AOC's of the world are now serious contenders.I too attack dems more repubs are open about their intentions dems are two-faced which means that more energy has to be spent on them to reveal their true nature dems have successfully fooled many progressives into buying into the ‚Äúvote the lesser evil just this once‚Äù argument I need not waste my energy on republicans beyond ‚ÄúI hate republicans too/this also applies to republicans‚ÄùI feel like the whole dem voter strategy is literally ""vote for the lesser evil just this once"". Like the main draw to their candidates is ""WELL AT LEAST HE'S NOT THAT GUY"".With Republicans you know what the party stands for. Democrats like to pretend they are different and fool people into thinking they are all ""for the people"". Really....they both like the same ideas.Exactly.  We can't beat the Fascists' until we remove the rot in our own party who enables and creates them.The Democratic Party needs to be destroyed. \s\sThe effort to ""remove the rot"" has failed.It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre paid to lose...Paid to lose. That's why Wall Street donates to both parties.The Democratic Party is the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globe Trotters.Wow this was really well saidWe've been saying this for years here.They are all in the same tax bracketNAILED ITWhispers in controlled opposition.That‚Äôs a perfect way to put it.  They‚Äôre the firefighters telling us they‚Äôre gonna stop the arsonists but leaving out free gasoline and matches.>It's funny to me that democrats didn't do shit to fight the supreme court appointment that they just spent months telling us was the apocalyptic horror we had to prevent by voting for a rapey segregationist  \s>  \s>Also the house majority could have stopped a great many things they just spent months telling us were apocalyptic horrors we had to stop by voting for a rapey segregationist but they didn't  \s>  \s>Literally every reply to these tweets: Liberals to poor people on the internet: you sonofabitch this is all your fucking fault you worthless piece of shit fuck you  Liberals to their elected officials: it's ok baby there's nothing you could have done\s\s[https://twitter.com/jediofgallifrey/status/1320882715202359296](https://twitter.com/jediofgallifrey/status/1320882715202359296)Plus Bernie kept telling us that Trump was a very dangerous president and yet Pelosi didn‚Äôt even bother to impeach him for his real crimes. The Ukraine fiasco was so f‚Äôcking lame but her sycophants lapped it up. \s\sEverything is rigged anymore that I don‚Äôt trust the election results. Democrats blatantly cheated Bernie in the primary twice so it‚Äôs not like elections can‚Äôt be rigged at any level. I don‚Äôt think democrats wanted to take the senate because they would be expected to do something for us. They want congress divided just so nothing can be passed. \s\sKabuki all the way.This is so simple and eloquently stated that it makes me wish I had written it. No it doesn't argue policy the only real fair critique worthy of argument. But it seems worthy of note that there are so many who still have yet to grasp the reality that democrats and republicans are opposite sides of the same coin that it's surely worth the time to continually point this out.ExactlyThose black bars above and below the image really made me think the reddit app had glitched.>Pointless imo to complain about republicans until that space for opposing them can be cleared and occupied by an institution that doesn't agree with them on 99% of the issues that affect the planet and its inhabitants.\s\s>It is in fact this and the observed futility of trying to clear and fill that space that makes me tend toward burning the whole motherfucking system down thanks for listening have a nice morning.\s\shttps://twitter.com/JediofGallifrey/status/1327544775575269376Hot damn this guy is fire!Something something parahnas....My reason is because I already agree republicans are terrible preaching to the choir rather do something productive with the time I would be wasting complaining about republicans.I've watched leftest fight for Democrats for the last 20 years.  Republicans score victory after victory totally unopposed and overtly assisted by the Democratic Party.  The leftest get stabbed in the back by the Democratic Party at every opportunity.  Yet here we are continuing to play out scorpion and the frog year after year.Liberals are the cork in the leftist bottle.Great discussion going on here.\s\sI wish I could contribute but you're all too good.Thats the problem with a two-party system. It's impossible to be against party A without implicitly supporting party B. Unless there is a viable third party C that offers competition to B in the opposition to party A you are stuck supporting B in whatever it stands for as long as they can say ""Hey at least we are not A"".>  you are stuck supporting B\s\sNo you really aren‚Äôt. \s\sThere ARE third parties that you *can* vote for ( even IF they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt"" win ). You DON‚ÄôT have to choose  A or B  you can choose to vote for C D  E ....\s\sOR you don‚Äôt have to vote for ANY of them!Meanwhile in Canada: You can vote Conservative or you can vote Liberal...but if you vote for anyone else on the left you run into problems with vote-splitting on the left because we‚Äôre still stubbornly wedded to First Past The Post.\s\sIt‚Äôs not nearly as bad as a strict two party system because there are Green and NDP (and Bloc I guess) politicians in power. But it could be so much better.Dems are a bunch of cheating bastards. They stole the nomination from Bernie twice and now they think they are gonna get away with stealing the election from Trump. If Bernie had been the legitimate nominee we wouldn‚Äôt be looking at a conservative Supreme Court deciding this election.Just because we hate biden doesn't mean we need to believe trumps tantrums. They didn't steal the election they're too incompetent to pull something like that off.> now they think they are gonna get away with stealing the election from Trump\s\sUh... what?It is nice to see that someone else realizes they stole  The primary election from Bernie.  Bernie was never part of their plan and they knew he would not win. Bernie would have never won. But it's OK he was paid off very well. But there's a lot of clueless socialist which means Communist following him. Because they just don't get what the end game would have meant for the world. Every country that's started out with socialism has been gifted with gov't domination and a dictator to destroyed and control them time and time again.[deleted]So why should left wingers not go after democrats who claim to be on the left's side when it comes time to get our votes?Including AOC and The Squad.Thank you for this incorrect shill take.  Have a downvote.That's absolute nonsense.\s\sThat's like shooting your own soldiers in the middle of the war because they are not killing the enemy as well as you'd like.\s\sYou'd not only alert the enemy to your location you then have fewer soldiers to fight them off with.This is an incredibly shit comparison. A better one is like military leadership actively keeping troops from the educational programs and healthcare they need for financial and political purposes and then they demand their troops just accept it without question.As if we owned anything let alone our own soldiers. \sBillionaires and the 1% own the lives of those soldiers u speak of. They have no problem sending them off to a war based on propaganda and lies and let them die for the sake of the petrodollar.\sTry again.""I don't blame the guy who burned down my house I blame the guy who didn't stop the person who burned down my house. Not burning down my house isn't the arsonists responsibility but it's the responsibility of this other person to stop the arsonist from burning down my home."" Its not the responsibility of individuals to NOT burn down houses it's the responsibility of individuals to stop others from burning down houses and if they don't stop the arsonist then that's worse than lighting the match themselves.""I don't blame the guy who burned down my house I blame the guy who promised to stop the guy who threatened to burn down my house who actually helped him burn down my house.""You do realize that the people who burned down the house were the Democrats who were working in full collaboration with the Republicans right? You know people like Joe Biden who wrote the Crime Bill the Bankruptcy Bill and drafted the Patriot Act. When the country moves further right it's because the ""opposition party"" went along with our political enemies and refused to hold the line and obstruct against regressive policies. No one party is responsible for the horrible state of this country right now. This is the result of a bipartisan project more than half a century in the making.Or you know the guy who saw the arsonist then went to help him deserves blame for it too especially if people went on to try to say the person aiding the arsonist is actually a hero. Everyone other then conservatives knows how bad the republicans are but people still treat the democrats like they actually care about stopping anything the republicans do.I blame the fire department who showed up to the burning house too their name too literally and started spraying gasoline on it.... But now you are using your space to go after the Democrats instead of Republicans so pretty much the same thingDo you have a single fold on your brain?Thank you for that hot off the Astroturf shill take.  Have a downvote.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sRED TEAM BAD ONLY VOTE BLUE TEAM NO MATTER WHO right?SWOOOOOSH!I want the bumper stickerüçï\s\sLots of respect.Can confirm. I got baited and jumped by a group of guys while delivering pizzas about 9 years ago. I still have problems being outside at night without getting an anxiety spell. I have problems even filling up gas at night - I have to remind myself that running out of gas will leave me stranded and in an even scarier situation. They caught at least a couple of the guys who jumped me because they were targeting more delivery drivers (including more from where I was working.) But I will probably live with this looming in the back of my mind forever.I wonder if pizza boys beat their wives as much as cops doThe Thin **Bread Line**\s\sCome on guys run your memes past me first.And I'm just guessing here but I bet they don't kill a thousand people a year.Most cops who die either kill themselves or die in car wrecks. The former is unfortunate but not unique (and relatively common among ex-soldiers which many cops are) while the latter is shared with just about every profession that spends a long time driving.\s\sIf we're looking for most dangerous professions it would be things like welders fishermen or roofing and construction workers for obvious reasons.Can we get stickers calling for no one to cross the ""thin bread line"" with this food and donate the money to food shelters?So glad I worked the day shift when I delivered for the pizza shop I worked for good gawd 27 years ago.  What a time.  Working full-time @ minimum wage plus (like $4.25/hour) qualified for food stamps taking college classes at nite; the nice thing was one of the local strip joints would order sandwiches every other week :)Damn straight.  Some deliveries are ambushes and they don't let you carry a weapon.I hope this is a bumper sticker somewhereHiro Protagonist is well aware.NahI turned on the press conference today to see if there was anything worth being informed about.

Asking for a friend.But it's a symbolic jester that makes the upper Suburban whites feel good about themselves instead having to make hard societal changes :(It‚Äôs bull SHIT\s\sI know I know crap is less violent.It‚Äôs an injustice this has taken so long. It‚Äôs criminal. Tax Wallstreet 100% we are sick of waiting while we do all the work and starve in order to be exploited and subjected to third world conditions in America only because we aren‚Äôt a billionaire. Sick.Bingo just said the same thing... illusion and not actual help.The same repost three apart...Democrats do this on purpose. This exact same thing happened with the 2008 stimulus and Obamacare. We always end up with inadequate half-measures that don't even maintain the status quo but cede ground to Republicans. It's been part of a concerted effort for the last 40 years by both parties to enshrine the values of neoliberalism into the fabric of American politics. The sad thing is that it's actually working to the extent that ordinary people are acting like dupes and defending this bullshit from the Democrats.That's why Bernie was right to shoot for the moon during primary season. The neoliberals start out with a compromise they're self-deating from the get and their timidity makes it clear they have no intention of fighting. \s\sI don't like Liz Warren but she had a soundbite I agreed with when she said ""stop talking about what you can't do and talk about what you can do"" I think that's when she was still playing the progressive role before backstabbing Bernie so it's a sound point. \s\sDems always create a self fulfilling prophecy before even taking office. They immediately start with the backpedaling and the media will start the gaslighting. Then they talk about reaching across the aisle when their initial position was a centrist compromise to begin with. You never hear the GOP talk about bipartisanship. Y'all Qaeda would storm Congress again if a Republican leader said they should work with Democrats. \s\sSo even if someone wants to argue that the Dems are ""less evil"" they can't claim they're an effective deterrent to the GOP. So if the red team is 100% evil while the blue team is 90% evil who gives a fuck when the blue team immediately and oftentimes preemptively folds without a fight? \s\sVoting blue is unironically wearing a Washington Generals jersey. Do people not see the same pattern as Obama's first year? Democrats have as much enthusiasm about passing leftist legislation as a Mississippi detective has about solving the murder of a poor black person. \s\sThis may be the first go around for younger Biden Bros. They may not yet be aware that every election is the most important election ever and it's imperative that the blue oligarch defeats the red one. Hopefully they will Demexit after witnessing the bait and switch.It's because D's and R's are basically supported by the same elite donors.  So when a donor-supported Republican policy comes up that the left hates the donors say to their Dem flunkies ""Look we know you have to look like you're fighting this policy for the sake of your constituents but at the end of the day we need you to let this happen.""  And then they do.\s\s""Aw shucks guys the unelected Senate parliamentarian is blocking us from doing something.  Oh well nothing we can do.""  Even though in the past it's never stopped Republicans.\s\sIt's basically collusion between the two parties and it's become so blatant now.  Old school Hillary boomers laugh it off as a crazy conspiracy theory but it's completely obvious to anybody with their eyes open.  It's so frustrating.Annnd this is how we get the Trump again. Only 2024 won't be the buffoon Donald it will be a slick smart Trumpist with MAGA priorities.StOp InFiGhTiNg!! \s\sYou're right and I'm SO SICK of people acting like it's wrong to hold Democrats accountable like we do republicans. Being a hypocrite is how you get apathetic voters.They always do that and the Reps never do. They give them far too much credit. But what can you expect by refusing to learn from any failures for over 40 years?[deleted]Sort of like the ACA only that involved lives not a mere $600.I'd say exactly like the ACA except for the lives.  (Which might be what you mean!  :) )The left and right parties march in lock step here in the US. Where one goes the other follows both destroying as much change-energy while doing it.""left"" partyThat‚Äôs because they‚Äôre on the same teamDemocrats and Republicans don't represent me clearly.50% of the American people agree with you and polls show the number is rising. Soon the people who insist on ""red vs. blue"" will be in the minority.Remember Nancy's own words: I'm a master legislatureShe is a master...of fundraising which is why she needs it to always be neck-and-neck between D‚Äôs and R‚Äôs otherwise people wouldn‚Äôt be scared enough into donatingI look at it like this. The Dems robbed every legal American adult of $600 off their check to support their own agenda driven covid relief expenditures. Pork barrel projects. Less than 10% of that 2 TRILLION DOLLAR covid relief package will actually be spent on covid relief. Yep 90% of the money goes to their personal interest deals it doesn't have a damn thing to do with the citizens. Pathetic.This is one of my favoritesYeah takes me back to the days when his buddy Obama stripped everything of value out of the ACA in the name of bipartisanship and the Republicans still gutted it further before refusing to support itas he knew they would.\s\sI spent so many shameful years trying to justify that bullshit.Because they weren‚Äôt trying to get Republican votes. Dems want to take from the 99% and give to the 1%. That has been the result of their campaigns their votes their private sector behavior...why can‚Äôt people see this very clear present obvious demonstrable statistically evident fact?\s\sI know I‚Äôm just preaching to the choir here. I‚Äôm grateful for the choir.Giving checks to needy people would provide a lot of relief but most of that money would go straight to landlords and banks and necessities...the economy already facilitates the upward transfer of wealth on its own so giving people money would not interfere with that.\s\sI think the Dems are really afraid of setting a precedent showing they‚Äôre capable of helping people in need. So instead they currently appear less helpful of working people than the Trump administration was which is really incredible.We know that but we also know that both the parties are doing exactly the same so we just want to have the better shit. After all all we are gonna get is SHITOnly one party in America.  The party of corruption.   Democrats depend on Republicans to stop anything good for us and Republicans depend on Democrats to stop anything good for us. So far it has worked like a dream for 40 years.  People still believe that Trump or Biden or any of them will ever let us be a real democracy or help us in any way.  \s\sIn the words of Trump  Sad  Bad Not good! The America people are going to come together and stop this madness!I wonder how many people there really are left who are confident in the integrity of our ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù. For pollsters to explore this question would be considered basically illegal at this point. Can‚Äôt be higher than maybe 8%A pre-emptive ""olive branch"" usually leads to shit on your face...I have come to expect this staggering foolishness from the Dems.It‚Äôs not foolishness it‚Äôs deception.They had a bunch of extra bullshit in it according to the arguments of R senators. They sold the American People over their own interests. Trash.Let's not kid ourselves the Democrats not-so-secretly want 99% of that extra bullshit too.it wasn't Bipartisanship Biden is a Repub. Why you morons won't understand it?> Why you morons won't understand it?\s\sBiden is exactly what today's Democrats are.\s\s*""I am the Democratic Party now""* - Joe BidenDefinitely not.

Oh right.Dem are the real Republicans other party is just Libertarians.Republicans are not libertariansRepublicans are just Nazis at this point.Did they?Yes. That said... I'm not 100% that it was for republican support. My understanding was that they did it just to be assholes.My understanding is that they originally wanted $2000 and $600 stimulus were passed in December as a bipartisan measure.  \s\sSo the $1400 is the rest of the amount that they originally wanted and once its passed will total the $2000 goal.That was never ever stated after the $600 went out. They ran the two GA Dem senators on $2000. Quit lying.[And yet that is so totally not what they said.](https://twitter.com/demswatchdog/status/1356282041889861632)I don't think they decreased it to get Republican votes they just never intended on $2000 because they don't fucking care about the ""little people"". They make that clear over and over and over. Except this time they blatantly campaigned and lied about it. And they are 2 months late. Had they actually gotten $1400 out on Jan 8 or something they had a case. Now they're just another 4k in the hole in my book and they're means testing even further. wake up sheep: STOP VOTING DEMOCRAT.The election was stolen an imposter sits in the WH issuing EO decrees like a King while the Capitol is fenced off like a warzone and all you guys care about is when you're going to get your next government check. \s\s$1400 or $2000 or even $10k....I'm not for sale.

She is just a violent alcoholic who the working class knew wouldnt fight for them.My mom loved her and im sure alot of other people in their sixties who are centrists/conservative or dreamt  their whole life of a woman president and don't know anything about policy and prefer to avoid bad news that would change their world view and paint almost every politician as evil even the ""normal"" ""sane"" ones that fit their demographic and ""unnofensive"" cheezy religious humor the way amy Klobuchar did.Huwite people voted for Amy Klobachar.>Who the Fuck voted for amy klobachar.\s\sEveryone ""favorite"" group of turtle loversInteresting how Biden/Harris have gone dark on this subject actually when was the last time we‚Äôve seen them?Harris came out of the woodwork to proclaim that despite living in Canada with Indian and Jamaican heritage her family practiced Kawanzaa every year.Harris cast her vote with Mitch McConnell to fund the bloated military and not try to force a vote on the checks.they dont need to appeal to the left for at least another 4 yearsTo be fair Biden nonchalantly (possibly lazily) said he supports $2000 checks at a press conference but hasn‚Äôt really put any pressure on republicans to do the right thing for onceI mean they haven't gone dark on it.  Any time he's given a speech or press conference that concludes with questions he's asked about it.  He says he supports the $2000 stimulus.More proof that the was expert shenanigans in the backfield for this election. Stack the election with conservatives that are in progressive clothing and decrease the chances the progressive will win.To be fair Bernie isn't a Democrat.

They then shuffled her into the Vice Presidential spot.  As soon as Biden kicks the bucket or resigns we'll get finance capitalists' pick for President despite her being so unpopular that she didn't even make it to the vote.  And people still believe they actually have a say in all this shit at the ballot box for some reason.

Heard it from her own mouth and when she was informed that several entire counties in Illinois had ZERO Medicaid providers or hospitals- she scooted out of the room so fast.this is just lies... this whole thread... they are all for it Bernies idea wont work if you want to get it done go down to Georgia and get the vote out.We are Democrats!

Oh yeah and fuck Biden and Kamala.as a yang supporter  i love Bernie. but i feel like many people in the Bernie team don't take yang serious. but hes been tweeting in support of 2000 everyday. and hes young. let me be clear; yang isnt a grifter. the idea of a ubi is something bernie even has endorsed. i hope bernie ppl will give yang a look. he just wants to help ppl. been folllowing him since the first debate hes consistent.right but Yang's not a SenatorYang only has UBI  everything else he is to the right of Bernies policies ( healthcare  free college etc). UBI is not enough to fix inequality and improve things.UBI is a fine idea.  Leftists have been talking about it for much longer than Yang has.\s\sAnd Yang is still a grifter.  His ""UBI"" isn't a real UBI.  It's propertarian snake oil masquerading under the name.\s\sI'm glad he used the term in mainstream politics.  But he also undermined its meaning and isn't worth supporting in terms of his actual policies.We like Yang.  Trust me.  He isn't a corrupt corporate puppet Dem.  What we want though is M4A.  Though I'd vote for yang in a heart beat over the corporate puppets like Harris Pete Warren or Amy.[Due to recent events in the great unmasking](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/km8dd6/andrew_yang_i_like_the_idea_of_forcing_the_vote/) my respect for Yang has skyrocketed\s\sAlso he was willing to call out Pelosi on the games she was playing with the stimulusThis isn't even true.

It was never about working with anyone or even listening. It was about showing how ""electable"" and ""decent"" Biden is. If the bar were any lower it'd be buried underground.I thought the plan was supposed to be:  vote for Biden then after the election keep holding his feet to the fire.Clearly plans changeAfter he's elected he will fail to deliver on his promises and we will incessantly apologize in his favor. That's what he actually meant from the beginning. People keep mincing his words like the whole debate about the $2000 stimulus checks he promised actually being $1400.\s\sWhat I mean to say is they all fucking lied.That got more difficult when his dog put one of them in a cast.Glad I left the abuse.I wish the Ghive idiots coming in here calling us Dorestans or whatever understood that this is exactly what they look like.\s\sImagine legitimately calling someone a fascist because they want the politicians they backed and donated to to actually you know... push left.Or that the party that purged a competing party from the ballot by force and is trying to purge government of any politicians who disagree with their corporatism (or brand thereof) and trying to label publicly questioning suspicious election results as ""inciting violence felony carrying jail time"" or at min illegal ""dangerous"" speech needing to be purged from public discourse is the party that's *fighting* fascism.  Yeah the assholes who are trying to ""purify democracy"" and ""protect"" citizens from information that contradicts their own narrative are the non-fascists.  Sure.Ghive?They're paid to do it. Nobody floods into a niche sub to continuously push a counter narrative day after day on their own time.Here's the reality.\s\shttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1360453915947356164\s\s\s@davidsirota\s\s>Everyone who had the courage to be right about everything for the last 20 years is laughed at and ostracized and everyone who agreed to be a puppet and be wrong about everything for the last 20 years has been enriched and given a huge megaphone.The democratic party is going to become the uniparty if they get what they want over the next three years. ""Causing disunity"" means anyone who is anti-establishment who shows any signs of critical thought and is critical of the state. There's absolutely no self-awareness whatsoever with neoliberals.They don't have three years. They have less than two. And they know it.Let's hope that new ""Integrity Party"" comes in and stirs things up a bit. I can think of quite a few centrist Dems who would feel right at home there. There's your unity.16 headlines on r/politics front-page containing ""Trump"".\s\sTrump ain't president anymore.\s\sIt's time to shine the spotlight on Biden. It's too fucking bad this loser that the Dems shoved down voters' throats has oodles and oodles of lies and corruption to criticize.This is why I'm an independent unffiliated voter. I enjoy telling both sides to fuck off.Ignore it. Anyone who isn't criticizing Lyin' Joe these days is not part of ""The Left.""I didn't vote for the slob and I don't care about people accusing me of disunity or whatever.   I wasn't united with them to begin with.> I wasn't united with them to begin with.\s\sThis is the crucial point that they cannot seem to accept.  Just because we'll never vote Republican doesn't mean we're on their side.  The reasons we won't vote Republican are pretty much the same reasons we won't vote for corporate Democrats.  Which at this point is essentially all Democrats.Just wait until 2022 and 2024. If they think Kamala and/or Buttigieg will be default next in line they are in for a rude awakeningI didn't vote for Biden and I will savor that to my dying day.I knew I would fucking regret it.\s\sIn 2016 I wrote Bernie in.\sI slept like a fucking baby that night. \s\sFuck this bipartisan bullshit.what did anyone mean when they said ‚Äúpush him left‚Äù tbh? how?Just push him.

Remember it is never the fault of the 200000 Democrats in Florida that voted for Bush. NO! It's your fault. The neoliberal gods have spoken.I voted Hawkins in 2020 and I apologize for *nothing*.I did too and Jill Stein before that.  I'll never vote for another corporate-owned war hawk.  Obama's last term was the final straw for me.You don't have to apologize for doing what's blatantly right.I wrote in Bernie right down the ballot Bernie.SameBiden's not in charge anyway. We could push him left to infinity and it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\s\sWho needs to be ""pushed left""? People like Victoria Nuland Susan Rice Jake Sullivan Merrick Garland John Kerry Janet Yellen and the dearly beloved Neera Tanden.\s\sGood luck with that.Tell them the left has oil.Neera Tanden is the only person that aesthetically annoys me even more than Trump. That smarmy ‚Äúfuck you I‚Äôll do it and get away with it‚Äùvoice is just gratingHence why I didn't vote for Biden we knew this was exactly what was going to happenI mean did we expect this to happen? I remember talking to my gfs mom (a hardcore neo lib and Obama Biden fan girl) after Biden got the nom. Before I could even say why I wouldn‚Äôt she was already coming at me with club mango fan club accusations. \s\sAlso it‚Äôs now super odd that a lot of the Warren and Bernie supporters have taken up this role. I didn‚Äôt like every bit of Bernies policy and his meekness at times frustrated the fuck out of me but I‚Äôd never in a million years try and defend fucking Biden and Harris to my fellow Bernie supporters let alone shame them.Boy that meekness and ‚Äúrising above the fray‚Äù stuff drove me nutsThank you. I was so fucked off whenever Bernie conceded. I would absolutely be his ride or die. I don't think he's able or willing to do that for us. I can't mindfully put my support in any politician ever again to be honest. Maybe if AOC actually runs for the presidency. I don't exactly see any other ethically sound people coming out of the woodwork.Yeah these ""I'm more of a leftist than you"" party-line voters are *not* the reason I stopped voting dem but they are *absolutely* a large part of why I have no regrets about it.\s\sWhat was all that they like to say about ""t0xIc SuPpOrTeRs"" again? üòÅFuck me I got called a trump supporter this morning lol I'm glad I moved away from the statesDespite the plainly obvious fact that the DNC cannot hope to win national elections without the progressive voter block the DNC continues to treat progressive voters like some sort of enemy faction and not the cornerstone that (narrowly!) got Biden the White House. The really sad part is that the progressives by and large are willing to just take it and vote for the people trashing them anyway.  If even a fraction of progressives organized and said ""we will vote 3rd party unless X is done"" that would effectively force the DNC to either capitulate to the demand or lose the election.They're fine with losing as long as the money train keeps chugging.The DNC continues to treat progressive voters like an enemy faction because they are an enemy faction. While the democrats are typically better on climate change and pandemics they're still a party ruled by big money. Progressives aren't their constituents.\s\sYou don't want to vote for them? They don't care they'll still be taken care of. They'd rather lose an election than get a progressive elected (2016 and almost again in 2020).\s\sI'm seeing a lot of people in this thread buying into the propaganda that electoral politics are the be all end all of politics. Under our current duopoly it's a tiny fraction of what elicits change.\s\sChange happens from the bottom. Our dear leaders aren't going to come in and save us. Let's not wallow in despair because the democratic faction of the oligarchy didn't give us what we wanted - they were never going to.\s\sLet's organize protest work on ranked choice voting a national third party start/join worker coops and start becoming active locally (if you aren't already).\s\sWhile I wish we could just abstain from voting to pressure politicians it isn't going to work.\s\sYou guys have so much more power than you realize once you stop thinking voting every 2-4 years is where politics starts and ends.Yeah I voted for Biden and I really regret it. I wanted to believe that he would truly make progress for this country. However; with everything going on this could not any more truer. I mean where are the stimulus checks that were promised to us immediately provided that Democrats won the senate??It's almost as if they lie to us while campaigning or something üòíSlam your reps on making unemployment insurance retroactive and keeping the $15 minimum wage in the damn recovery bill.\s\sHell slam *Bernie‚Äôs* office asking him to threaten to hold it up if we don‚Äôt get that much. He kind of has the power.I mean i think he was the right choice given the curcumstances but lets not kid ourselves that he was going to be a great president right?That's why you don't vote for Biden at all.You're not it's the liberals that have a problem with it. The left is pretty united against him.\s\sE: a wordGood point.  We progressives are united against Biden.Remember no one voted for Biden because he was Biden. They voted for him purely on an anti-Trump platform. That was it. Whatever Biden does will be better than we would have had but he absolutely is not going to be the president the world deserves and the world needs to let him know that all the time so he does better.>Whatever Biden does will be better than we would have had\s\sHard disagree.  Its already clear he's exactly the same but with no scrutiny corporate media praise and a free pass and no mean tweets.  Even my TDS addled dad isn't trying to pretend there's any real diff outside of the twitter feed or that anything is going to be better.> Whatever Biden does will be better than we would have had \s\sYeah seriously dude we have to stop this narrative. He's exactly the same. We're looking at policy here not how he speaks or tweets. He's probably going to be worse because the people who think they're on the left are going back to sleep and focusing solely on identity politics over anything of actual substance.in some ways trump was the lesser evil and in some ways biden was the lesser evil. Ultimately  they were both the same amount of evil when adding up the pros and cons which is why i didn‚Äôt vote for either of them.If it weren't for double standards Democrats would have no standards at all. ¬©redditrisi 2020 2021.  Beside they only reason they are more concerned with the left  is the lack of disunity to their right as to what really matters to them.\s\sOn the other hand no one should ever worry about what his or her opponents say about him or her. If they have nothing valid they'll just make up something.  So just do the right thing and keep moving forward without getting distracted or discouraged.I voted Biden in a swing state so that 2 voters in a safe state would vote Green.\s\sRegardless of what Biden does my vote was well done.\s\sOfc electoralism is near pointless.Walk into the voting booth and your choice is between two bowls of shit. (Credit to Louis Black.)  How many elections can you count back to where the choice was not the same? My best guess is 1944. Look it up.I cannot say this enough. American needs a new voting system. Ranked Choice Voting Approval Voting or Proportional Representation are all miles better than the abysmal system of First Past the Post. We need more progressives to start changing the voting system.\s \sEdit: I don‚Äôt mean that progressive Democrats are at fault here they‚Äôre in the minority and they‚Äôre already busy pushing for comprehensive change but more should be encouraged to adopt a new system.Big Facts! It just shows you how polarized our society has becomeBide has to Chastised just like The Last guy You make promises & Don't keep them then You to get Called OutAs a libertarian this warms my heart so much. I absolutely love seeing people get a taste of their own medicine lolI didn't vote.  I don't plan on ever voting again ever.\s\sThe system is rigged and corrupt.  I will encourage as many people as I can to join me as a proud non-voter.Logic fail. Potential foreign disenfranchisement propaganda.I think you took a wrong turn at Albuquerque... Re-evaluate what you did on step two...I absolutely believe in chastising and criticizing Biden but I'm results-oriented. We need to work on Dem Senators Representatives and Republicans too. Our government isn't run by one person and *tons* of things we blame Presidents for are controlled by Congress.\s\sThe checks are being held up by two Dem Senators Sinema and Manchin and 50 Republican Senators. Why not work on *all of them*? When we blame Biden for Manchin and Romney voting against $2k we only stagnate our own interests.> When we blame Biden for Manchin and Romney voting against $2k we only stagnate our own interests.\s\sThat's some really aggressive spin there.  You're conveniently leaving out the fact that Biden himself has publicly come out against $2k checks (after previously being for them pre-election).\s\sI'm results-oriented too.  That's why I'm *not* supporting Biden.And nobody ever talks about local elections those matter too people.Help him catch up the paperwork that the ‚Äú44th‚Äù administration shoved under the carpet for 4 years so that legal processes can be examined and reformed.Hope you guys are having a great dayYeah pretty cool. Your day good?Push him left.  Yeah how is that working out for you DNC supporters?

Roberts capitalists are simply at the top of the pyramid of market-dominated producers. What if humans capable of rational deliberation want to make healthcare free? What if they want to assert that the environment is valuable in itself? The invisible hand imposes itself decisively: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\s\s>Marx described the phenomenon of ‚Äúcommodity fetishism‚Äù: through many small separate acts of exchange we command each other to behave in very specific ways while disclaiming this same power and attributing its commands to blind necessity. Commodities are inert objects and humans are rational beings but society operates as if humans were helpless against the pressures exerted by the market. Market domination even finds lucid expression in natural-sounding phrases like ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt sell out to Facebook they‚Äôll just copy my features so may as well do it myself‚Äù and ‚Äúif I paid you more I‚Äôd have to pay everyone more and then we‚Äôd lose to the competition and all be out of a job.‚Äù\s\s>There is nothing wrong with denouncing American plutocrats like Bezos and Gates for greed but we cannot stop there: we must understand that the system of exploitation is not held together by any individual‚Äôs vices. As Lenin put it ‚ÄúThe capitalists divide the world not out of any particular malice but because the degree of concentration which has been reached forces them to adopt this method in order to obtain profits.‚Äù If one of them had a major change of heart and stopped pursuing ruthless accumulation they would quickly be ousted by stockholders for endangering their investment. In the unlikely event that their stockholders were cooperative a competitor would swoop in and relieve them of their commanding market share. This is not apologia for Bezos but we need to understand that there is a talent to being a capitalist exploiter or else we will underestimate our enemy. The market selects for profitability and it selects well ‚Äî it just doesn‚Äôt select for environmental responsibility or decency or who can bring the most benefits to the greatest number. From Marx to Lenin to Deng we can observe a baseline level of respect for the enemy: ‚ÄúManagement is also a technique.‚Äù \s\s>On my view the core Marxist insight is the following: Feudal lords were the masters of Feudalism. Capitalists however aren‚Äôt the masters of capitalism. They are merely the high priests of capitalism. The master of capitalism is Capital itself.\s\sfrom https://redsails.org/why-marxism/[deleted]Nothing doesn't mean I shouldn't still be disappointed about it.who has link from the tweet?https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/1421441834920910849No cannabis decriminalization or legalizationJoe said it's a gateway drug.Don't forget that promised immediate $2000 check that came out after several months was $1400 and was packaged with billions of free tax payer dollars for the corrupt wealthy assholes destroying the country and working class.people are in trouble they are in pain and running out of hope but they are so out of touch with reality plus they don't seem to care I'm sick of these people in power :(\>spend four years frothing at the mouth over orange man\s\s\>democrats rig the election and put in the same thing but also with alzheimers\s\slol[deleted]Voting local makes large differences in this.

It‚Äôs mind blowing to me how indoctrinated people become and really do believe that these people are going to help them. \s\sBoth parties are controlled by greedy totalitarian mindsets and a complete lack of regard for the everyday person just trying to get by. \s\sI‚Äôll end this with one thought before I go on another rant. \s\sTerm Limits!!!Term limits gives us more Obama's. People genuinely thought he would pass popular stuff like a public option. Instead he did a mandate so far right even Trump removed that for-profit insurance tax on workers. \s\sThe only advantage now is I know the Democrats are all beholden to far right extremists like big pharma. So nobody can trick me into supporting them. \s\sThe reforms necessary involve taking money out of politics and banning large conglomerates from owning our media companies. \s\sThe reason we keep electing right wing extremists is because our media calls them ""moderates."". 90% of Americans are against the pharma industry and the high prices they charge. Even 69% of Republicans want Medicare expanded. \s\sBut corporate media calls you a ""moderate"" if you take the most money from extreme lobbyists. That's the problem. Fix that first.So my rep went in with term limits as part of his deal.  He recently retired he said he changed his mind on term limits.  Cuz it takes time to build connections to get shit done.\s\sYa no shit jackass.  When you have ppl who've been in the same position for 40 years they are going to want you to kiss the ring to get shit done.\s\sWhen you have everyone limited to 10 years max suddenly a fire get lit.  And those connections get made a whole lot quicker.Term limits serve to move the real decisions into unseen rooms by unelected people.> Consider term limits. The US Constitution was amended to enforce term limits in direct response to FDR‚Äôs popular 12-year presidency (he died in office going on for 16). As a policy it is self-evidently quite anti-democratic (robbing the people of a choice) but nevertheless it has been conceptually naturalized to the extent that the 2019 coup against Evo Morales was premised explicitly on the idea that repeated popular electoral victories constituted a form of dictatorship. If rotation was important to avoid corruption or complacency corporations and supreme courts would institute term limits too. Term limits ensure that in the miraculous scenario that a scrupulous charismatic and intelligent individual becomes a rebellious political executive they won‚Äôt be in power long enough to meaningfully challenge the entrenched power of corporate vehicles manned by CEOs with decades of experience. Wolfgang Sch√§uble a powerful advocate of austerity policy in Europe succinctly summarized the extent to which electoral democracy is subordinate: ‚ÄúElections cannot be allowed to change economic policy.‚Äù  One Party States and Democratic Centralism are not the result of lack of sophistication or cronyism they are a proven bulwark that acknowledges that political power will often need to be exerted against the will of Capital and so the wielders of said power must necessarily undergo a much more serious vetting process than a popularity contest.\s\sfrom https://redsails.org/why-marxism/It's not like [he didn't try](https://i.imgflip.com/5i7wsp.jpg) to warn people...Based and Gump-pilled.

But this democracy is always hemmed in by the narrow limits set by capitalist exploitation and consequently always remains in effect a democracy for the minority only for the propertied classes only for the rich. Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slaveowners. Owing to the conditions of capitalist exploitation the modern wage slaves are so crushed by want and poverty that ""they cannot be bothered with democracy"" ""cannot be bothered with politics""; in the ordinary peaceful course of events the majority of the population is debarred from participation in public and political life.\s\s\s‚ÄîLenin [*State and Revolution*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\s\sthe USA is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; the gains of the New Deal were an anomaly granted as concessions by a bourgeois class terrified of a global militant organized worker's movement.All Dems care about is that Biden isn't Trump.

It‚Äôs never their responsibility and their awful governing that suppresses anyone‚Äôs interest to bother showing up to vote for them is NEVER an indictment of how much they didn‚Äôt raise a finger to help anyone or even bother acting as an opposition to Republican interests. \s\sHalf of voting eligible Americans don‚Äôt vote and an insane number of normal people will straight up tell you they don‚Äôt care about voting because it doesn‚Äôt help them or meaningfully benefit their lives. And they‚Äôre 100% correct that neither party cares to do anything to help them. The past decades have been a complete bipartisan project of destroying the working class. \s\sBut once republicans pass this voter suppression legislation the Dems will be forever powerless and they will have an eternal excuse. No blue maga idiot will ever criticize Dems or hold them responsible because the story will end that Dems are powerless because the totalitarian republicans who declawed their voter base. And it will never be their fault ever again. And the only reason they couldn‚Äôt do anything with total control of the govt under Biden was because of Manchin/Sinema and the parliamentarian. \s\sI seriously will probably give up voting for Dems but I‚Äôm considering voting in the midterms (I‚Äôm in GA so I guess we‚Äôre a purple state now where there would be value voting that way) *just for the singular purpose* of trying to ensure the Biden admin has full control over the govt his entire first term so that when he gets stomped by the next Republican candidate he can‚Äôt blame it on congress holding him back. \s\sPeople still do that now with Obama saying that he *only* had two years and then constant obstruction. I don‚Äôt want Biden to have that. We have to break Dem hold over people‚Äôs minds that they‚Äôre the good guys when it‚Äôs so clear both parties aren‚Äôt fighting for the working class. \s\sThe entire role of Dems is to let all energy in the country get dissipate into their party. The best way to expend your political energy atm is work on building a labor movement. Get involved with a labor union take part in and support any local strikes don‚Äôt cross any picket lines and join a union/organize your workplace now.

InterestingIf you look back on it as a revolution there was a large subset of colonial ruling class elites revolting against the remote British ruling class. There was considerable thought into how to keep the rabble out of the decision process.More like the wealthy on this continent decided *they* should be the ruling class replacing the wealthy people thousands of miles overseas.the American revolution was a bourgeois revolution driven by material interests: protecting the status of the northern merchant class as middlemen in the tea trade and the southern landed gentry's interest in slavery remaining legal after the 1772 English court decision of Somerset vs. Stewart.\s\sif it was about oppression from a ruling class the new American government wouldn't have restricted the franchise to white male landowners beyond a certain sizealso workers are allowed to protest over more than pay + conditions: Australian workers struck over Frank Sinatra being sexist back in the 1970sDangerous conditions ain't shit compared to Beet juice pussythis meme is literally complaining that a trans labor action is being covered in place of a cis one (presumably) it really isn't hard to see the transphobia hereAre you implying that there are no trans workers at John Deere or Kellogg?\s\sIt‚Äôs not an issue of transphobia but that the media would rather cover workers who got offended by a comedian rather then workers who are feeling shit on by their company contracts.

Chapelle isn't their employer.Man that‚Äôs so crazy. I‚Äôm glad I get my news from Reddit instead of media but I do listen to radio on my way to work and have heard them talk about Chappell but nothing about workers strikeits as if the Corporate Media and the Corporate owned Politicians are carrying water for their $ Masters $Reddit is corporate media.Corporate Media shows love to the Corporations that advertise on their channels lolNetflix isn‚Äôt a proud sponsor.it's because it involves a celebrity's name. that garners more attention. the media gets more clicks and views. \s\sthe netflix story is important trans rights are human rights. but these strikes are an important story too. they should be covered equally.Yes the trans protest of ten whole people at Netflix lead by a homophobic racist methhead clout whore is indeed important.its not that important.

What happened to you people?Where are the transphobic comments so I can address them if you can point them out?It's not transphobic to point out that the media is ignoring strikes featuring thousands of workers striking for better pay and instead focusing on a netflix walkout of 200 or less over some asshole comedian because it fuels the culture war.I believe this post is about the mediaSearched Kellogg on Google News and this was the top story:\s\s""Kellogg‚Äôs sued for not having enough strawberries in Pop-Tarts""That's just completely a lie.  \s[https://imgur.com/a/mIfj1L3](https://imgur.com/a/mIfj1L3)\s\sI like turtles and FThumb is a TERFYeah that's probably the reason but I doubt that's the main one.\s\sI honestly thought they chose Netflix for PC appeal to Trans People showing ""diversity"" and maybe for shock value because the strikes are for similar reasons and their message (within each protest) is rather consistent.Media here in Syracuse mentioned that New York Amazon workers are trying to unionize.You're not allowed to mention the times media outlets actually do something right.They should cover both.200? Read Matt Taibbi's piece on the over-statement. More like less than 50 Netflix employees protested.Breaking Point with Krystal and Saagar is actual real news on Monday Tuesday and Thursday.

Why do you think 2018 was all about ""believe all women""  but in 2020 the party nominated a sex pest?  2016 was about trans people in bathrooms (or was it 2014? I'm losing track).  The second the elections were over both sides dropped the issue because it was a charade all along.Yes it should have.   Hopefully  the budget chairman thing will make a difference.Since both parties are corrupt as fuck anyway maybe progressives should start running republican.

The Democrats and liberals would cancel them for not being woke enough the Republicans would disappoint them for not supporting any programs that would help them in their daily lives. \s\sThe problem is that political culture in America doesn't allow for people to agree on some ideas and not others. Every time someone like Jimmy Dore goes on Fox news talking about medicare for all or an end to the wars the comments are full of people saying ""I might not agree with Jimmy on everything but he is right on this issue."" What is the typical liberal response to this? They scream ""How could Jimmy Dore go on Tucker? He is a secret right winger."" They completely ignore the issues and jump straight into red vs blue. They effectively eliminate any possibility to form alliances over the working class issues.Nonsense.  Democrats have won the popular vote for the past several elections.  Center-right my ass.  Btw what is the Woke agenda?  If treating all people like humans equally is some radical concept to you then I don't know what else to say.

Yet here we are still begging for yesteryear's livable wage knowing they will likely phase in whatever they finally give us over several years.  \s\sAt the very least let them see that dragging their feet on increasing the minimum wage interminably won't always  work in their favor.Yeah $15 minimum wage is absolutely the bare minimum. We also need medicare for all and student loan debt forgiveness to lift huge financial burden of a generation that has suffered for decades. \s\sNone of this even begins to address the concentration of wealth issue which is a whole other beast.Surprised it's only 23 when you consider inflation tooDon't be it's not a practical answer. You can't just calculate an equivalency when so much else has changed. \s\sSo many things are improved cheaper more expensive or newly available in comparison to back whenever. If in the future technology enables us to all live 300 years without sickness in modestly sized but perfectly pleasant automated homes without having to work much how would we calculate minimum wage then? We wouldn't look back to now or the 1960s for sure.\s\sYou have to calculate it based on the here and now if you choose to calculate it at all. Business should not be run in order to ensure everyone can always buy the same amount of ice cream cones per hour of work.Did productivity of minimum wage jobs increase at this rate? My guess would be no.That would be a cool stat to look into$15.75 is just a small amount of what they‚Äôre stealing. Their labor is worth all the profit they produce for the people that take it and use it to buy a new yacht or house.Many businesses lose money. If a business loses money does that mean they paid the workers too much?This is why I state my starting wage to be $50 per hour. I'm open to negotiation but I'm starting with demanding an entire loaf of bread not at crumbs hoping to work my way up to a slice.seriously no one can survive on that wage it's depressingThat's why we're having a ""labor shortage"" ... no one can survive on those wages so they won't take jobs at those wages because they want to live and even have ambitions to live decently the lazy bastids!That's only $3 trillion a year.When I was pretend alive in 1960 an ice cream cone went for a few Lira today I can go to a hipster and no amount of Lira will get me my scoops! That's infinite inflation! I SHOULD BE MAKING A LIVING WAGE OF 3 SCOOPS AN HOUR!\s\sI hate it when people use selective indicators and then act like everything else is the same so a simple algebra equation tells us how to run all businesses.Selective indicators like the measure of what someone‚Äôs labor is worth?\s\sGTFO with your nonsense.Where would we be if they‚Äôd gotten it all along? How many new technological advances would we have made if people could fund college with a weekend and summer job like the Boomers did?If you want an education that is the equivalent of boomer college (i.e. college in the 1950s) most community colleges will do. And you can definitely pay for one of those with a weekend or summer job.I don't think I have ever heard an interview where the reporter/journalist asks opponents to the minimum wage hike why it reasonable to expect people to do the same or more work today than they did 60 years ago for far less money.Why would he or she want to risk his or her cushy job by asking a question like that? Oligarchs own the media. The only place you can get questions like that asked is on the Web.Usually when the talking heads talk about labor they refer to any pay increases as ""wage pressure"" and then the conversation turns to concerns about inflation caused by ""consumers"" having a little more money to spend.Productivity isn't a measure of work it's a measure of output.\s\sFor example if you run a widget machine that outputs 100 widgets a day and make $200 a day and then the company upgrades the machine and now it makes 150 widgets a day but you do the exact same thing are you working 50% more?\s\sI can understand the argument that the increased output should be shared with the workers but that doesn't mean the workers are doing more (or harder) work in all cases.Price floors are not raises. Raises are raises.  \s\sMinimum wage is not a left issue it's bait.That is nearly $2 million being stolen per workerMind bogglinghttps://twitter.com/JosephNSanberg/status/1416772147385536514I'll just leave [this right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/lodzg0/a_brief_and_unentertaining_walk_through_the_blue/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).$23 an hour isn't living luxuriously either. Fifteen years ago it took two**** $23 an hour earners (i.e. my Ex and myself) to afford the house with the pool in the 'burbs and all! the attendant bills. $23 an hour today pays for what an apartment in a 'nice area' and a good car? ""It's a big club and you aren't in it"" rings mighty true huh.when you're used to nothing even a little sounds a lot to people. i make about 19/hr (compared to the 12/hr min wage here) for a no college experience job... which barely lets me afford to live in a pretty low end 1 bedroom apartment and have my own (used!) car. it's miserableBut hey we can buy an NFT house lolI think the main issue with this whole thing is that prices always go up therefore wages always (should) have to go up but the size of the amounts makes people uncomfortable. The constant increase in prices is the real problem. It's not an argument I'm prepared to defend with facts and figures but I think we need massive price deflation. But debt has to also be reduced by the deflationary rate for this to work. Or fucking just wipe it across the board.Billionaires gotta get their billions from SOMEWHERE.Mooring fees are expensive.Fucking jail bird:\s\s>Early in his political career Debs was a member of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen Debs led his union in a major ten-month strike against the CB&Q Railroad in 1888. Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU) one of the nation's first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894 Debs signed many into the ARU. He led a boycott by the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike affecting most lines west of Detroit and more than 250000 workers in 27 states. Purportedly to keep the mail running President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.\s\s>In prison Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement. Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America (1897) the Social Democratic Party of America (1898) and the Socialist Party of America (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for President of the United States five times including 1900 (earning 0.6 percent of the popular vote) 1904 (3.0 percent) 1908 (2.8 percent) 1912 (6.0 percent) and 1920 (3.4 percent) the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native state Indiana in 1916.\s\s>Debs was noted for his oratorical skills and his speech denouncing American participation in World War I led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a ten-year term. President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence in December 1921. Debs died in 1926 not long after being admitted to a sanatorium due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison. \s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs So he died from speaking political speech. A Republican President commuted his sentence. BTW anyone who can run for POTUS as a newer party candidate from prison and get any measurable portion of the vote impresses me. \s\sFor those who don't know Cleveland was the only Democrat elected President between POS Democrat Buchanan and POS Democrat Wilson. In addition to using the US military to break a strike he conveniently located the US Labor Day in September.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair \s\sAnd what did former Democrat politician Debs say about that party over a century ago?\s\s>I believe that democracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no ‚Äútwo evils‚Äù exist. There is but one evil party with two names and it will be elected despite all I can do or say.Pyramids-R-UsThe advantage you give your children by educating them is over nature.It's hard to believe that such an intelligent educated man didn't understand how fucking *healthy* competition is.  Except to those who are stampeded and crushed underfoot by it of course.  Which is the vast majority of the citizenry.\s\sBut then I take it that Debs was never wealthy himself.Co-operation can't hold a candle to competition. /sYou can have anything you want in capitalism as long as your willing to strangle everyone that gets in your way.Thus we end up with sociopaths at the top of both the business and political arenas.> You can have anything you want in capitalism as long as your willing to strangle everyone that gets in your way.\s\sNo.  That is not true.[deleted]Socialism isn't scary except to those who buy into propaganda. And I don't think running from labels under attack helps anyone much. Plus nobody I know would appreciate being called an anything-capitalist... Frankly with the younger generations especially *that's* the scariest label- responsible for every current horror we must overcome to survive.Socialist is only scary to those who either don't understand what it means (requires education) or stand to lose their upper position in the heirarchy.Putting neo in front of something doesn‚Äôt make it cool.Humanists should be the new title. You can‚Äôt taint that label.Can't? ...I doubt that. Biden could start using the term to describe himself tomorrow and it would be adopted and repeated by blue checkmarks everywhere.It is a team sport the working class however does not have a team in congressThe way people say team sport in politics implies blind loyalty and emotional attachment and victory.  That's at least why I compare Trump's tallies to a pep rally.  And for the most part these people maintain willful ignorance about what he's really doing they just care about winning and being involved in something.Yea.. Like Cuba. The island thousands of people died trying to escape from to America. The real Cuba where the people are starving this very day. Where you are forced to comply. Dude... You need to really learn more about what you think you want... Because it is BULL SHIT. You aren't a small percentage who ""really gets it"" or smarter than the people who condemns socialism/COMMUNISM. You make think this gives you an edge and makes you superior but truth be told you are very delusional as to how the citizens of these countries really live. ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD TRADE THAT LIFE TO WALK A MILE IN THE SHOES OF A SPOILED BRATT AMERICAN THINKING THEY WANT SOCIALISM. WAKE THE FUCK UPDo you even know what Cuba was like under Batista the US backed dictator who had his military rape and murder the Cuban people who dared to speak out?\s\sBatista in a few years killed more people than Castro did in *decades*. By all means be critical of Cuba's shortcomings but they should be in context. The dictatorship of Batista was objectively worse in virtually every way.Ah yes Cuba with the UN honour for food security\s\sI'm sure the UN is just secretly commies right?\s\sEdit: also worth mentioning: this ""US lifestyle"" you talk about? It isn't some product of the US being ""more capitalist"" it's a product of US imperialism and economic hegemony maintained through an aggressive structure of domination upon the global south south America SE Asia Africa etc. It subsidises the lifestyle. That and European heritage which is where America got the imperialism from!(1) not everyone on this sub is a communist try understanding basic definitions before you speak.\s\s(2) there are some people who defend cuba unilaterally but i definitely can‚Äôt get behind that. Cuba has impoverished the working class and has therefore failed its original goal. I‚Äôm not a communist though.\s\s(3) why do you assume that socialist americans are spoiled? A terrible assumption to make considering most americans live paycheck to paycheck.\s\s(4) have you tried taking other people‚Äôs perspectives? Recognize your privilege and realize that you have it better than so many others before assuming that all the socialists in the country are ‚Äúspoiled brats‚Äù. It‚Äôs been over 200 years and the conditions for the working class still have yet to match the ruling class.

His policies aren't going to be any better than Trump's for pretty much anyone.\s\sMr Lee is exactly correct; the Biden administration does NOT signify a move towards representing the interests of average Americans.The worst part is that they don‚Äôt know it and are celebrating when we are all STILL getting screwed overAgree... An ass hat was removed but nothing changes.  As instantly demonstrated by Biden rolling out the bones of establishment past with his cabinet choicesBernie took his campaign money and ran. Here is what everyone here is over looking. This isn't about democrats vs Republicans ect. This is about Patriotism vs Globalism. Bernie is apart of the same Globalist that want to remove America and implement a One world government. With ONE digital currency under communist rule. They are selling it as a utopia but if history tells us anything a government with complete and total control ALWAYS leads to vicious tyranny. \sGoogle the GREAT RESET.Shut the fuck upBut it wouldn't be communism - it would be fascism. They have to make sure the oligarchs are still rich. They'd just let them enjoy their wealth in exchange for serving the interests of the state.Okay first off uniting the world isn't as terrible as you make it sound with your boogieman of the NWO we are all human and we all share this planet like it or not it would be far better for us to work together rather than the positioning and threatening to wage war with others. That's the alt you support an inevitable war that will likely destroy us all because of the insanity of tribalism you support.\s\sSecondly having one form of currency wouldn't be terrible either it means corporations cannot exploit workers abroad means that there is no reason to outsource jobs to other countries to save money on labor costs for the company.\s\sThirdly patriotism is pointless everyone thinks their country is either the greatest or terrible there's no point to it other then to brag and boast I'm not interested in that bs.\s\sCommunism isn't facism communism is a social position it's saying that everyone should be equal that there shouldn't be an owner class that rules over others that workers who do the labor that provides the goods should decide collectively how and where that money is spent rather then a board of rich investors and a ceo that gets upwards of 10x what their workers get by cutting costs like outsourcing your job to another country where they get away with paying workers less then here in the US that no one should be too poor to exist because they either cannot work or because they rather contribute to society in non monitary ways like being an artist and enriching our culture helping us to stand back and appreciate the little things or sending a bigger message like Banksy does with their art.\s\sEverything that communism stands accused of is the reality under capitalism and everyone is waking up to that fact.\s\sAnd lastly no one wants to give government total control not even many communists look up anarcho communism it's literally the precise opposite of giving government control it's a movement to abolish government completely but push communism which can be done via collectivism aka local communities working together like state governments with no federal.\s\sEdited for grammer and spelling.I see what your saying.

I don't care how polite they were on Twitter or to their buddies in the media; they continued the horrific policies of their predecessors while pretending to be better than them.  \s\sPolicy is the issue not party. Eternal wars oligarchs and empty promises come in every color- Blue ones aren't superior to Red ones.Exactly correct; it's time to hold party accountable to policy. The problem is that the Deceptocrats have started to use idpol as a substitute for policy and I'm afraid people who aren't paying close attention will be fooled.Apology is policyTo be fair Obama put families in cages what trump and sessions did is very different. I am not defending Obama and if you look closely the entire system is corrupt but let‚Äôs at least make sure we are clear about the fact that the current administration split up children from their parents.You think it to be SO cool to be a socialist right? It's not. People in socialist countries are trying to escape them and risking their lives to do so. You think MORE government is the answer? It is NOT.

Some economists suggest that we should actually *lower* federal taxes on the working class during the transition to Medicare for All. The extra spendable income in every family's home will increase consumer spending which will lead to an increase in private sector hiring giving displaced health insurance industry workers more opportunities for new employment.If the gluttonous rich got taxed their fair share of their civic duties we could have M4A free college and a slew of other social programs for the well-being of our citizens and the workers taxes could go down to boot!We could do it right now without their taxes.

For example I work for a small company and we are reimbursed for insurance premiums. If the premiums go away so does the reimbursement.

Not (always) in their strongly-worded tweets but in their *actual* actions.\s\sBernie was always center-left at best and ever since he rolled over and started running defense for Biden he's also *effectively* right-wing minus his strongly-worded tweets.\s\sStrongly-worded tweets and letters mean *nothing* if you don't follow them up with actions and neither Bernie nor AOC nor Khanna nor anybody on the supposed left is using their actual positions and power to do anything.\s\sThey could block the ""relief"" bill until the (already insufficient) $15 minimum wage is included but they're not doing that. All they do is tweet about it and do some theatrics.\s\sThey're acting as if they're powerless even though they're not. They're tweeting as if they cared about the people they were elected to fight for... even though they don't.\s\sWhich makes them effectively the same as those supposed 'moderates' aka corporate republicans.\s\s&nbsp;\s\sIn recent times the *only* high-profile US politician to have shown over and over again that they *do* stand for the people and are willing to fight for them no matter the pressure is Kshama Sawant. And surprise surprise she's not a democrat because *she* is actually on the left with a fucking spine. She and others like her if they can be found is the one who should be getting the maximum amount of support. Not Bernie not JustUS dems not any democrat 'moderate' or not.They're not failing!!! They're serving their corporate owners quite well as a token opposition party. They're the Washington Generals!Willfully ignorant.And that I simply cannot abide. \s\sIt is one thing not to know.

Roberts capitalists are simply at the top of the pyramid of market-dominated producers. What if humans capable of rational deliberation want to make healthcare free? What if they want to assert that the environment is valuable in itself? The invisible hand imposes itself decisively: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\s\s>Marx described the phenomenon of ‚Äúcommodity fetishism‚Äù: through many small separate acts of exchange we command each other to behave in very specific ways while disclaiming this same power and attributing its commands to blind necessity. Commodities are inert objects and humans are rational beings but society operates as if humans were helpless against the pressures exerted by the market. Market domination even finds lucid expression in natural-sounding phrases like ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt sell out to Facebook they‚Äôll just copy my features so may as well do it myself‚Äù and ‚Äúif I paid you more I‚Äôd have to pay everyone more and then we‚Äôd lose to the competition and all be out of a job.‚Äù\s\s>There is nothing wrong with denouncing American plutocrats like Bezos and Gates for greed but we cannot stop there: we must understand that the system of exploitation is not held together by any individual‚Äôs vices. As Lenin put it ‚ÄúThe capitalists divide the world not out of any particular malice but because the degree of concentration which has been reached forces them to adopt this method in order to obtain profits.‚Äù If one of them had a major change of heart and stopped pursuing ruthless accumulation they would quickly be ousted by stockholders for endangering their investment. In the unlikely event that their stockholders were cooperative a competitor would swoop in and relieve them of their commanding market share. This is not apologia for Bezos but we need to understand that there is a talent to being a capitalist exploiter or else we will underestimate our enemy. The market selects for profitability and it selects well ‚Äî it just doesn‚Äôt select for environmental responsibility or decency or who can bring the most benefits to the greatest number. From Marx to Lenin to Deng we can observe a baseline level of respect for the enemy: ‚ÄúManagement is also a technique.‚Äù \s\s>On my view the core Marxist insight is the following: Feudal lords were the masters of Feudalism. Capitalists however aren‚Äôt the masters of capitalism. They are merely the high priests of capitalism. The master of capitalism is Capital itself.\s\sfrom https://redsails.org/why-marxism/Love how the right always shows you how they ubstructed the will of the people at the same time blaming it on the leftLet‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre an ant-hill person\s\sIf one group tells you they‚Äôll burn an ant hill to the ground and another one tells you they‚Äôll do everything in their power to stop group one you‚Äôre 100% justified to get angry at group Nr. 2 if they instantaneously sit down and start lecturing you about how ant hill protection is just not feasible as a concept that some arson had to be expected and that arsonists are just so very passionate about fire so why even bother when arson is actually kinda cool if you‚Äôre the one doing it but maybe with Napalm instead of white phosphorus because it‚Äôs kind of more humane that way and anyway what are you some sort of ant-hill person?Do you need more proof that it‚Äôs two sides of the same coin?

But this democracy is always hemmed in by the narrow limits set by capitalist exploitation and consequently always remains in effect a democracy for the minority only for the propertied classes only for the rich. Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slaveowners.

Republican want and use power. Dems have zero interest of using power and enjoy being perpetually powerless while pearl clutching over the depraved things republicans do while not lifting a finger to stop it. \s\sImagine letting the American people continue to wallow in poverty because you ‚ÄúrEsPeCt tHe pArLiAmEnTaRiAn‚Äù. Always gotta respect the process as you watch the process be thrown out the window by your opposition and that already broken process you insist on following prevents you from (1) actually helping your people and (2) convincing anyone to both showing up to re-elect you. \s\sThe sickening part is that the Dems maintain their support by convincing people that they only can‚Äôt do anything because of someone else. Either the republicans blocked them some rotating cast of Dem villains popped up right on time or if they lose it‚Äôs because the voters were too dumb to vote for them or because they were too racist.\s\sIt‚Äôs the job of a political party to provide a platform that helps people and convinces them to support you. But Dems do not do that. They DONT help people threaten them with the cudgel that Republicans will do worse to you and then blame you for suffering under republicans. Which means you‚Äôre backed into the corner of supporting the Dems who will still slowly bring us the same direction. It‚Äôs always our fault the voters. It‚Äôs never their responsibility and their awful governing that suppresses anyone‚Äôs interest to bother showing up to vote for them is NEVER an indictment of how much they didn‚Äôt raise a finger to help anyone or even bother acting as an opposition to Republican interests. \s\sHalf of voting eligible Americans don‚Äôt vote and an insane number of normal people will straight up tell you they don‚Äôt care about voting because it doesn‚Äôt help them or meaningfully benefit their lives. And they‚Äôre 100% correct that neither party cares to do anything to help them. The past decades have been a complete bipartisan project of destroying the working class. \s\sBut once republicans pass this voter suppression legislation the Dems will be forever powerless and they will have an eternal excuse. No blue maga idiot will ever criticize Dems or hold them responsible because the story will end that Dems are powerless because the totalitarian republicans who declawed their voter base. And it will never be their fault ever again. And the only reason they couldn‚Äôt do anything with total control of the govt under Biden was because of Manchin/Sinema and the parliamentarian. \s\sI seriously will probably give up voting for Dems but I‚Äôm considering voting in the midterms (I‚Äôm in GA so I guess we‚Äôre a purple state now where there would be value voting that way) *just for the singular purpose* of trying to ensure the Biden admin has full control over the govt his entire first term so that when he gets stomped by the next Republican candidate he can‚Äôt blame it on congress holding him back. \s\sPeople still do that now with Obama saying that he *only* had two years and then constant obstruction. I don‚Äôt want Biden to have that. We have to break Dem hold over people‚Äôs minds that they‚Äôre the good guys when it‚Äôs so clear both parties aren‚Äôt fighting for the working class. \s\sThe entire role of Dems is to let all energy in the country get dissipate into their party. The best way to expend your political energy atm is work on building a labor movement. Get involved with a labor union take part in and support any local strikes don‚Äôt cross any picket lines and join a union/organize your workplace now. Until we can make demands we‚Äôre completely trapped with them.It's because Biden went too far left /s\s\s/s needed because that'll be the corporate propaganda messagingI'm sure it's the Republicans fault/sI hate our government.

We don't have a left party here.> I'm a firm believer of the government existing to serve the people which is the exact opposite of what we have. \s\sThis is the ""is/ought"" fallacy. You're describing how you want things to be versus how they actually are. \s\sThe state exists to serve capital. Period. Your opinion of how it should be is irrelevant. You are not their boss the wealthy are.Dont you understand this is what the people want. Pelosi hasnt changed 33 years in office Biden hasnt changed in 47 years. The people vote for them because they like the chaos the insue.They are serving the people. Any poll says the majority of people don‚Äôt want a green new deal filibuster reform count expansion an end to drilling or Medicare to all. \s\sAny quiet frankly any non-brainwashed person knew they had no magical plan for the pandemic or plans to fix the law that incentivize children to come to the border.\s\sSo here we are.

People genuinely thought he would pass popular stuff like a public option. Instead he did a mandate so far right even Trump removed that for-profit insurance tax on workers. \s\sThe only advantage now is I know the Democrats are all beholden to far right extremists like big pharma. So nobody can trick me into supporting them. \s\sThe reforms necessary involve taking money out of politics and banning large conglomerates from owning our media companies. \s\sThe reason we keep electing right wing extremists is because our media calls them ""moderates."". 90% of Americans are against the pharma industry and the high prices they charge. Even 69% of Republicans want Medicare expanded. \s\sBut corporate media calls you a ""moderate"" if you take the most money from extreme lobbyists. That's the problem. Fix that first.So my rep went in with term limits as part of his deal.  He recently retired he said he changed his mind on term limits.  Cuz it takes time to build connections to get shit done.\s\sYa no shit jackass.  When you have ppl who've been in the same position for 40 years they are going to want you to kiss the ring to get shit done.\s\sWhen you have everyone limited to 10 years max suddenly a fire get lit.  And those connections get made a whole lot quicker.Term limits serve to move the real decisions into unseen rooms by unelected people.> Consider term limits. The US Constitution was amended to enforce term limits in direct response to FDR‚Äôs popular 12-year presidency (he died in office going on for 16). As a policy it is self-evidently quite anti-democratic (robbing the people of a choice) but nevertheless it has been conceptually naturalized to the extent that the 2019 coup against Evo Morales was premised explicitly on the idea that repeated popular electoral victories constituted a form of dictatorship. If rotation was important to avoid corruption or complacency corporations and supreme courts would institute term limits too. Term limits ensure that in the miraculous scenario that a scrupulous charismatic and intelligent individual becomes a rebellious political executive they won‚Äôt be in power long enough to meaningfully challenge the entrenched power of corporate vehicles manned by CEOs with decades of experience. Wolfgang Sch√§uble a powerful advocate of austerity policy in Europe succinctly summarized the extent to which electoral democracy is subordinate: ‚ÄúElections cannot be allowed to change economic policy.‚Äù  One Party States and Democratic Centralism are not the result of lack of sophistication or cronyism they are a proven bulwark that acknowledges that political power will often need to be exerted against the will of Capital and so the wielders of said power must necessarily undergo a much more serious vetting process than a popularity contest.\s\sfrom https://redsails.org/why-marxism/Why should there be consequences for Trump officials?I'm curious what they meant with that one too. but hey at least Biden stopped building off the wall last week....Yep it's time for brunch üòé""Normalcy"" and ""decency"" have been restored!

Still running under the Constitution of 1850 these severe limitations on the size of its legislature as well as its needlessly bicameral nature should be the first things abolished.\s\sTexas is next with over 942000 per Senate seat and with its far larger House a much better 195000 to one ratio there but like 47 of the states I didn't mention as well as California is *needlessly bicameral*. If one of the two parties doesn't control more than 2/3 of both houses or the governor's office and more than half the upper house can block *anything* including the revenue bills that are required to originate in the lower houses because this portion of most state constitutions were literally copied needlessly from the federal one where the House with proportional delegations from each state being the only one with this power prevents smaller states from screwing over larger ones financially.I've been telling people that everyone should do this for 30 years!!!!!!I fully support getting rid of two-party bullshit and implementing age caps on elected officials.

When I corrected the mistake ($1000 to $1200) the amount that I owed the IRS went from ~$300 to ~$500 which leads me to believe that at least a portion of the stimulus money needs to be paid back. I have to say that I was somewhat surprised at this revelation.

Sounds like you are making a mistake on the forms. 50k isn‚Äôt close to the phase out so your return should be unaffected by your stimulus. You might be putting EIP 1 where EIP 2 goes and vice versa.But you aren‚Äôt completely mistaken there are scenarios where the stimulus received is significantly higher than the stimulus receivableYou were owed 1200.00 for the first stimulus which is considered a tax advance. When you claimed 1000.00 they added a 200.00 refund that was eliminated when you corrected it. In other words if there had been no stimulus check you would pay the taxes your are now. There is no tax or payback on the stimulus money.How does the Democratic Party even exist?\s\s2016 with such a horrible candidate like Hillary.

Fuck us I guess.It needs to be laser targeted  just like Trumps deficit exploding tax cuts.......I thought that was from increased spending while tax revenue didn‚Äôt change much.Actually the tax revenue collected the first year of the tax cuts was a record high. It seems spending is what drives the deficit. Every year President trump submitted his suggested budget which would have reduced spending and the Democrats refused to pass a budget without adding more spending. That is easily confirmed if you ignore the propaganda of the left and their ally the fake news and just look at the facts. Mathematically when more people are working and paying taxes and companies are making higher profits they pay taxes on it does increase tax revenue.TOXIC BIDENBROSWe gotta visit Carol in HR to get our damn checksThere's no 2k checks you gotta be kidding me I got boxes full of 2k checks!

I think you're thinking about the engineers that designed it.First I make one component of that system and I make 1x the cost......\s\sSecondly they would not use a javelin on 1 individual. It's an anti vehicle weapon mostly tanks.I‚Äôd be surprised if one of those Javelin rounds was only $80000.We should make Javelins more affordable/sNo no no.

We need to shut down the economy until ‚Äúour‚Äù representatives work for us instead of the corporations and gluttonous rich.To do any of that we need stronger labor laws in the US. Then those laws are enforced by unions with power of federal law. To get there we start by crippling them at their biggest days. 10 days will absolutely destroy retailers 10 days after black Friday and the last 10 days leafing up to christmas eve. That's is why we set a date. On the dates they absolutely mado everyone to work. So we say fuck that and chill out for 10 days. I just quit a forktruck job last month and after 2 weeks I had a new one for $1.75 more and hour. I start Nov 8th. Once I'm hired into the company directly I will see raises going upwards of $20 USD. I quit retail 3 years ago but I still remember my homies and homgirls. Working together with family and former co workers we can stand or huddle in solidarity for two spots of 10 days.\s\sEdit: tldr crush them for 10 days with no demands at black Friday. Do it again at christmas. Then we tell them what we want or they can expect more rolling strikes or whatever the plan is. Wages and paid time off is just a begining.Right.  It's almost as if the oligarchy were expecting these days of revote and carefully shaped public policy to get enough political and economic leverage to keep worker's docile and submissive.  The majority of America people are chained to medical credit mortgage debt all by design.  How can a person rebel if they don't own their own time and energy?And just in case that all failed they militerized the police under the guise of ""liquidating excess supply"" and built themselves self sufficient fortresses.  Even the IRS has a plan set in place for continuing tax collection under societal collapse.   They're 100% certain these are very real possibilities while the US population has trouble believing their guy isn't a fascist oligarch.So what happens when the shelves and gas stations are empty and the utilities are shut off? 10 days would have months of impact. If everyone walked out those same people would suffer the most. No food gas power etc‚Ä¶. There would be riots and looting in a scale you have never seen before. But yeah you‚Äôd feel better about yourself.Do it on Black Friday. Shortest general strike in history lolGotta get organized.

Bank interest rates are near zero bonds aren't much better and crypto could go *poof* at any moment.  So almost all the money goes into stocks and real estate.  This is artificially propping up the stock market where the risk of stocks is perceived as less than the certainty that ""safe"" investments will lose value due to inflation.We've been propping up the elites with endless reserves of credit.  There are instances (as with Amazon) where the collapse supported a particular business strategy and generated real profits.  Yet most of our tycoons have been cruising along on subsidies while investment bankers can always count on their Uncle Sam to cover any bad bets with ""temporary"" relief to be sure our *least needy* citizens never see their personal high scores sagging in a way that might cause them some distress.The federal reserve has been giving banks trillions since September 2019 and before Covid hit. Obama gave them $39 trillion during his tenure. It‚Äôs just another way to transfer money upwards.."

I've heard a few stories of people finally realizing the system is entirely rigged against us.[deleted]It's not about the destination but the memes we make along the wayThe liberals had the inauguration and the proles can laugh at billionaires losing some money. It's okay.\s\sWe should be doing what we can to leverage the moment into some sort of gain in class consciousness.[deleted]It's good evidence to radicalise dumb libertarians who bang on about the free market though.\s\sJust point to this and say ""look this is what deregulation of the market for 40 years has produced: a market rigged for the ruling class"".\s\sLike who would have guessed.It's even worse Silver Lake a major private equity firm just used reddit make a ton of money: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E)\s\sanyone that thinks this is more than a meme or that they will actually ""win"" is a complete idiotYa never know:\s\shttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfI also doubt any of them lost their own money. More likely they just gambled away other peoples private pensions. No hedgefund managers are going to the poor house.they are going to find a way to turn it around. Even if they don‚Äòt biden will almost certainly help them.Capitalism's mask has been pulled back a little more. That's a step in the right direction.Fuck man at least it accomplished more than occupy Wall StreetIt's dumber [individual investors aren't the majority shareholders](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) not by a long shot.  So in effect we're watching giant billion dollar institutions transfer wealth to other giant billion dollar institutions over reckless gambling due to the US bailout being a multi-trillion dollar money cannon pointed solely at Wallstreet (effectively encouraging this behavior).  Like that's your fucking bailout money they're playing with.  A few crumbs spilled on the floor for non-millionaires / billionaires and now everyone is proclaiming this as some sort of heyday for the masses.  Basically this is like one case where normal people are getting a little COVID-19 stimulus money.  Instead of celebrating we should be asking why the trillion dollar money cannon funded by taxpayer dollars is pointed at Wallstreet and not Mainstreet like the rest of the world.Well while it won't fix it it is definitely getting attention. And I think that's the first thing to get before actually changing something with a movement.Also as much as we like to frame it David vs Goliath. There‚Äôs a bunch of other hedge firms taking advantage of this too. It‚Äôs basically Goliath vs Goliath with a bunch of David‚Äôs latching on.On its own no. But think of the political capital alone this will generate. Democrats can reform wall St and point to this event as the reason and get actual traction. It'll be a winning argumentWell maybe if you just don't consider it meaningful. The result it's shown is the fact that the system is so rigged against poor people and tons of people are waking up to the massive propaganda machine they run.I am doing that and putting into renewable energyMaybe it would if you and many others would join the movement. Come on over the water is warm (and hilarious).[deleted]Making a hedge fund cry is a meaningful result for some of us.Im not so sure. If the counterfeit shares theory turns out to be true all bets are offWe're just trying to entertain ourselves during the pandemic.\s‚ÄúDie corpo scum!‚Äù is sounding more and more like a good sloganNot unless we keep doing itand a lot of people chattering about this are about to get screwed and do not even see it coming.  Brace for this next wave of tears as these big fundies find a way to outsmart them next time.Yeah it‚Äôs less of a full scale revolution like some people are saying and more like a few guys ran into the stock market and started beating one of the suits with sticks.Maybe but let's not act like they don't deserve it.They get mad at you cause you‚Äôre wrongNo but it‚Äôs done more damage to them than any protest has in the past. Maybe we‚Äôre on to something? Organize and speak with your wallet. It‚Äôs the only thing that hurts them. I seen a billionaire cry this week. :)We just gotta keep chipping away at what the rich have. All tools are allowedBut it'll hopefully change the lives of us smaller guys. Who in turn will provide better lives for their kids' generations. Then those kids' and their kids' could one day become leaders or scientists that change the world for the better.The bigger picture is more important. Truth is I‚Äôve never seen so much class consciousness in the global north as right now.At best this may force regulations they should have been in place.  These guys have been screwing retail investors for years.My first thought when I started seeing WSB in mainstream news was ‚Äúoh great a bunch of wannabe autists are going to crash the economy out of some mismanaged sense of justice.‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love that more people are seeing how the markets are rigged but if you look at history the consequences usually don‚Äôt come down on the folks rigging the game it just means regular people lose their retirement funds (or worse).I don't know what makes you think the past week was the whole event. The squeeze has barely started and if people keep holding GME they could quite literally make the entire market collapse.\s\sWhether that will happen or not is obviously anyone's guess(obviously huge odds in favor of market manipulation saving hedgefunds from suffering too many losses) but either way the following weeks will be a huge revelation to a lot of people not just how deep seated government and market corruption are but that we *aren't* helpless to the oligarchy and can drive the narrative with collective passionate effort.\s\sHopefully there will be a transition from a defeatist attitude towards a more active and demanding one which is an absolutely crucial development.oh it will because it's repeatable it's changed how markets will have to operate.  Imagine any time in the future there's a company that has poor prospects like blockbuster in 2005 for example.  From now it'll be unsafe to estimate that that company doesn't have a viable future.  You're going to see a lot of companies that are worthless or downright evil getting effectively propped up by the fear that shorting them will trigger a gme event.  Could happen next with facebook for example.Maybe if you stopped being such a negative Nancy you would be able to celebrate small victories like us. Yeah it might not have any long lasting results but the fact that it happened is a good thingIt's gotten more done than any protests have.Many hedge funds are also profiting off the current GME situation. Redditors who think they're riding righteous rockets to the moon are mostly helping other big hedge funds with more sense than Melvin buying GME calls or holding GME. When GME crashes guess who'll be left holding the bag?Not with that attitudeIdk I feel like it will give a lot of people hope. It‚Äôs easy to see capitalism so ingrained into our society and just lose all hope in changing anything. \s\s\sBut if a few resistors could shake up Wall Street THAT easily people will start to see we absolutely are capable of change when we all band together with a common goal. \s\s\sWhile it may not have any DIRECT results at the very least it‚Äôs a signal.TLDR: ..plus more & The Introductory Paragraph...\s\sThe people manipulating our worth via the stock market for decades for an eon they are and continue to do so with full media attention. So giving them your opinion is close to the best thing we could be doing. It would be great if we took these opinions and forwarded them to our congress and other respectable meaningfully relative entities so that as a body we can figure this out. I would think we could be more precise of where we place the true consequential feelings we have to being misused and controlled by the too wealthy elite corrupt and systematic. They are currently and have been manipulating and scamming the regular person the common human the retail trader and our children's futures like they're collecting chicken eggs!\s\sDo you imagine when the media is on to another topic they will quit manipulating our money for their gains stealing from us our finances and retirements. If they are so obviously manipulating the market in full news they still manipulate the market when people look away. They are frauds extorting the market and companies through manipulation. \s\sThere's no way they are not manipulating us. Their excuses are frail and not capable of explaining past Occams Razor the theory that the simplest answer is the correct answer. In this situation there is an obvious market manipulation and frauding of the common person who trades on made easy to trade applications for the regular person by manipulating that application. They are denying us the same right to trade at the same time as they are allowing hedge funds to trade. So the billionaires in hedgefunds are allowed to rip us off and make money while at the same time we are restricted by the elite from buying stocks to make our own money. Does this sound like a random occurrence to you? No Its not. \s\sYou are living right now watching a conspiracy take place. These conspiracies have been taking places for decades maybe five or more decades. You are watching the too wealthy steal from you and your friends' lives and your children's future lives. The wealthy are co-conspiring with the Elitists to make the broker RobinHood to deny regular traders from buying the stocks that will make them money and thats because the money made will be coming from the billionaires wallet. But these classes are at war with us and they are showing clearly their power to attack the common human and wage war against us. They have been at war with us for decades as well; but now obviously you can see it happening live in the mass media. You can fight back in so many ways. Why fight? Because the Too-Wealthy Too-Rich Elitists have started a war against you. In this war you do not have your government at your back they have been securing minds and positions corrupting politicians in our government and even being elected for decades.\s\sThe uber wealthy and elitists are attacking us now. Like right now and they have been doing so by controlling the most powerful resource our money our wages our ability to live our lives to the fullest. They even have proven that happiness comes from a certain limit of wealth. Over that limit and the money is meaningless but any change up to approximately $100000 yearly makes a difference.\s\s These too-wealthy and often Elitists' have vast numbers greater money than what's needed for peak happiness 100 times 1000 times more. They have so much they could not-work and their entire extended family not work for tens of generations hundreds and hundreds of years. They have so much they don't know what to do with it. While we struggle in a daily / weekly challenge to simply buy food and have enough to watch our favorite shows and retire while still being able to help our children through university graduate education. Even education our childrens' futures are not guaranteed because of the too-wealthy purposely avoiding and escaping taxes they take so much basic income from us that it could pay for our children's education three times over.\s\s*These wealthy elite are at war with us. Its called a class war.* Its synonymous with the war of money a wage war a war on our true value in a capitalistic society. If in war the Americans were undersiege by the middle east the middle east would firstly be attacking our water supply. This is exactly what the wealthy elite have done they have found a way to manipulate the flow of necessities into our country and have begun syphoning water from us. Not just water but they steal our rations and medical supplies. Even though the earth supplies the wealthy elite with all they need they steal and hoard our necessities. They are fat with necessities and use what they have stolen like monsters of crime and the Mob to sharkfish steal even more giving them too much control over our independent lives which are meant to be diverse as individuals with culture. Instead the *middle eastern* ""too wealthy and elite"" in our own world speaking our language and manipulating our money are using all of our necessities to corrupt our politicians. You see the necessities is our money. The water is our liquid assets the food is our wages and salaries. The medicine are our savings and investments. They directly manipulate the flow of necessities using uber rich groups of people discussing market manipulation strategies (such as this gamestop short & the news surrounding it). They use our necessities they've stolen as collatteral to take more power more than they need they take more so they can use it to take more than that just spread out over complicated ways in order to avoid the regulators and government just like they do with taxes they are doing it to control more power to control us and our people even more. (All studies and government policies support a diverse power structure in order for power to not harm us and instead benefit us). This is real its really happening and has been for decades and decades. We are just super lucky to have a free and uncensored internet.\s\s [Please please please! fight for the free and open internet it must stay liberated for the sake of our free lives to have a life worth living and to our and our childrrns benefit save the internet from corrupt political grabs at power and control and censorship! thank you thank you thank you!]\s\sThe wealthy elite find which politicians are greedy and fat from avarice they bribe and control the politicians by over-paying them for shallow and close to obviously being bribes--they mock up short speaking engagements at business parties. They use underhanded subterfuge and extremely war-like intelligence agency tactics to force their control in our our democratic government for the people. They corrupt our government in the open using disguise when it reality its pure corruption that they are lucky enough presents itself as symbiotic  occurrences in the business sector. But it is more than that!\s\sThey too wealthy the elitist classists the corrupt government officials. The siphoning and stealing of our necessities the directly manipulation of our needs--our money and markets--the only way we can truly vote nowadays is being stolen away from us in clear day light by billionaires and elite scumbags who honestly believe in their supremacy over everyone you know; even doctors and engineers rocket scientists. Basically anyone worth their salt worth a true value to our world those who create and manage our societies and build our futures. For singularly and especially their own selfish benefit these too wealthy / classists / elite want power and control over your grand children's lives and currently your child and your own. These people and they are only people defeatable but there are too many they're at war with us. In this war they want to OWN you. They currently do is so many ways and they are winning since they continue to destroy our livelihoods and be bailed out by us and our government using out money! They think they are too elite and handle too much wealth for us to let them fail. We are too damn good! Its either we are altruistic goody goodies in every way or they have corrupted so much of our government they only get what they want!\s\sThese ""middle eastern"" classist & greedy money terrorists have been constricting us by the neck tie for decades. They manipulate openly our needs / markets  they control too much of our worth and demolished our wages through the years. We have true value and the severely underpay you your product value is ten to five times greater or more than they give you in salary or wage. They destroy people respecting themselves as workers and employees they deny us benefits and want us on food stamps so all our money and taxes that they avoid are used to spread out only our wealth and not theirs to the population restricting our taxes to something that should be practically given free food and water and shelter should be a entitlement and IS a right of ours we must achieve. In their destruction of our honor and worth they purposefully poison and act of war attacking those *just talking of* UNIONS  and whistle blowers like its treason when it's the exact opposite. Unions and whistleblowing should be mandatory as they are only beneficial to human beings. Everything should be done at the benefit of human beings and not fraudulent entities as if they feel pain and suffer they don't while humans do we do suffer in pain. But they use intelligence war tactics against you to make you believe they are a feeling caring being but they are robots companies made of logistics like code and feel no pain. \s\s*We must survive in happiness despite the too-wealthy classist elite corrupt governing systematicly wared &! take no less. Thats why certain respects are donated to ourselves. By meditating on these Mantras we experience true sight and thus making decisions for our futures become natural extra-ordinarily when you know your enemy.*I try to be optimistic is it LSD rain?Nitric and sulfurous acidWell at least we'll be anime girls.If I'm an anime girl in 2041 I'll consider it a win.Me in 2041 pretending hot Nestle brand synthetic water is coffee while I watch the acid rain and remember that one time u/YallAintAlone made a post on the r/DankLeft subreddit.the pain.Full morning routine: https://youtu.be/a7s8Ts_EnIQnestle.... uh ohI think Nestle was chosen on purpose for it/r/FuckNestleIf acid rain is the worst you‚Äôre dealing with in 2041 this is optimistic AF.Why is this libtard paying for hydration and sitting down when she should be working to pull herself up by the bootstraps?I can't wait to turn into an anime girl in 20 years.Mm why you consuming Nestl√© though?

What Communist leaders have done wrong is just as important to analyze as what they've done right even after you've learned to see past the capitalist propaganda that tells you Communism was all of the former and none of the latter. The goal is dialectical analysis not mindless boosterism.Yeah when my country was occupied by soviets they did some pretty crappy stuff. Old people always talk about how they had to ""hide their daughters from the russians"" I think you can guess why. People still celebrate when they left and make jokes like ""the Russians are coming!""\sThere are people who genuinely had bad experiences  at the hands of communist governments it's not fair to say they all deserved it nor is it productive.While I agree more or less completely with what you are saying. I think that the people blaming communists broadly rather than someone specific like Soviets for example are more likely to fit into the narrative of the post.\s\sPeople with legitimate grievances tend to be more specific about who did what.So glad to see this pointed out hereFor me it's more the ""my family fled the communists"" storiesArgentinian?I honestly don't really get this - what piece of info is missing?The grandpa was a fascist slaver etcTheir grandparents were class enemies[removed][removed][removed]My Grandad was actually shot by a communist during the civil war in Greece. The civil war instigated by the capitalists (Churchill to be precise). The man was also a refugee from Turkey during the exchange and fought against zi fascists in WW2 and again fought the fascists during the junta...that was propped up by the capitalists (CIA to be precise). My point is... ummm...my Grandad was a fucking badass and despite being shot by commies expelled by Turks and fought against zi Germans the only people he had any animosity towards were Olympiakos fans.[deleted][removed]Important to consider the secret police set up by certain regimes. The first that comes to mind is the Stasi in East Germany. While some of these grandpas were certainly slavers or fascists not necessarily all of them were. This needs a lot more nuance.Meme funny not smartYou realize that the Stasi was a direct reaction to western infiltration right?\s\sIt is often wholly ignored how the west forces socialist states to create strong internal security forces due to the vast amount of resources the west pours into destabilization.As much as I'd like to think that only cuban landlord's sons say this the politburo did kill a lot of actual communists.Gots to purge those lefties outta the communist party after all.\s\sEdit: why is this being downvoted? One of the first things Lenin and co did after winning the Russian civil war was attack all the groups further left of themselves.[removed][removed]‚ÄúGuys communists killed my grandpa and here‚Äôs why! Communists came to my grandpa‚Äôs $200M manor built on the backs of his slav‚Ä¶ err loving employees and forced him to stop hoarding his immense wealth from the people! His poor heart couldn‚Äôt take it and he died right there! Communism is pure evil!‚ÄùI live in Poland and my great grandpa was literally taken to gulag for flying a Polish flag when Soviet army entered his hometown. And before you ask he wasn‚Äôt a capitalist just a simple farmer trying to make a living for his family. So please don‚Äôt say that literally every person killed by communists was a slave owning billionaire if you have never met anyone from a communist countryThe flag that was identical to the one they had as the Polish People's Republic flag? The exact same one before they had before during and after Poland was part of the Soviet Union? \s\sCould you please tell a believable lie?[removed][removed]We can accept the failures of the Soviet Union NK and China. Failure to learn from failures leads to more failuresive heard people say this tweet/joke is insensitive i dont quite get it yet is this specifically an american history thing?It‚Äôs offensive to all the people whose grandparents were really killed by the communistsit reminds me how a lot of germans got to buy a big house for very little money in the 30s-40s even though they didnt earn very much. nobody talks about how jews lived there and were forced out. these houses got sold for cheap to german families~~Ironic exactly 38 years ago today my grandpa lost his life and before that his leg due to chronic insulin shortages in Soviet Romania. Completely treatable if it wasn‚Äôt for government failure in securing medical supplies.~~\s\s~~E: grandpa died in ‚Äò83 which means it was 38 not 28 years ago arithmetics is hard.~~\s\sE: I googled my grandpas death certificate because I realized I could prove my story is true without doxxing myself. Apparently he did die in '93 which makes the story I've been told kinda weird.

Maybe someone in southern Mexico needs to be an anarchist and someone in Vietnam needs to be a Marxist Leninist to get to where we wanna go.[removed]Don't expose us we live peacefully underground hereI see it more as caring about the means not just the end. The further in you go the more you care about realistically caring about logistics. Often forgetting about the means.That's pretty much where I fit in. These days I have very little interest in theory. Maybe some day I will but for now it's just personal experience feeding my beliefs and I kind of feel like that should be enough because I know where I stand on a lot of things.

As long as we‚Äôre moving away from capitalism and into something else sign me up!I'm a pragmatic socialist. I honestly don't care how we get there. I just know we need to tear down the capitalist hierarchy that's been strangling this world. No ideology is perfect and we shouldn't expect them to be.Same Marxist revolution Anarchist revolution it don't matter just give me a damn revolution.I believe in a socialist monarchy üò© /jEverytime it comes up about being a socialist I make sure to emphasize my support for workers control and rights in antithesis to capitalist greed. Some may call me a commie or whatever but that's what I stand firm on.Yes! This is me as well.I say I‚Äôm a councillist but that‚Äôs just because I believe Councillism is the most efficient way to achieve socialism. In all reality I don‚Äôt mind being around/listening to ML‚Äôs or Anarchists or whatever. As long as they wanna tear down capitalism I don‚Äôt really care.i just say im an anti-capitalist.\s\si don't know enough about different leftist ideologies to have a solid opinion on which ones i think would work or which ones are better. i do know enough about capitalism to know things could be much better.Yeah I don‚Äôt really understand why the left spends so much time arguing about what to do after capitalism is gone when capitalism is still very much hereI stick with the even more generic ""leftist"" I'm nowhere near well versed enough in theory to have a strong opinion on anarchism vs communism I just know that I'm anti capitalist.I like to fuck with right wingers minds by saying I'm an anti establishmentarian or anti-neo-liberal. They hear the word anti and liberal and it confuses them.I love this so much people don‚Äôt know their poli-sci \s\sIt‚Äôs incredible to me that once you take away (or undermine) buzzwords how many issues people actually agree on.Ima try this.us broThis post is just bait to get people to break rule 2FYI Marxism and the various ideologies that fall under that umbrella or are inspired by it aren‚Äôt hats to be taken on and off. To use dialectical materialism as an observational tool is to determine what the most effective tools are in a particular place time and cultural context to develop socialism. The reason there are so many versions of this is because there are many different people who have begun revolutionary struggle in unique material conditions.\s\sThis is why I no longer identify as anything but a ‚Äúsocialist.‚Äù The goal is not to find an ideology that is ‚Äúbest‚Äù but to examine our particular needs and develop solutions to them that are necessarily unique to our context.You're a comrade and for now that's what counts ü•∞\s\sAfter the revolution... that's when it gets difficult üò¨ /sHonestly as long as capitalism exists it simply makes no difference and it's just a stupid reason to infight before anything actually changes.Yeah we all just need to work from the common ground that unions = good and should get to the point where the workers can demand full control of their workplace\s\sBut also that if we are refused our rights we should stop at nothing not even violence to get them backClass solidarity.Not really. Theory gives us the framework and ideology for actually rejecting capitalism. Rhe Cubans read theory the Black Panthers read theory the Koreans in the north read their theory.  Grifting streamers will never get us there.you‚Äôre an anarchist communist but abstract labels don‚Äôt really matter just build power in your community to reduce our contribution to and dependence on global capitalismAy it's me minus the sexy.You underestimate the power of ideology. <comradely wink>Por que no los dos?I don't give a fuck what the state looks like as long as the means of production are owned or controlled by the workers running them and the state doesn't serve as opposition to thatI recommend reading State and Revolution by Lenin.The state will always serve as an opposition to thatRead The State and Revolution by Vladimir Lenin. If you agree with the whole thing you're a communist. If you agree with some parts of it but go ""wait a minute...."" at other parts you're an anarchist.[removed]I'm a Communist but If someone figures out how to abolish the state after we get rid of capitalism I'm all ears - we need more leftist unity after all. The state seems like a nice method of distributing stuff like food and organizing labour at least to me ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬ØI‚Äôm an anarchist but if this hypothetical benevolent state existed I wouldn‚Äôt oppose it as a stepping stone.I still have difficulties to determine whether I am an anarcho-syndicalist or a council communist. But I will find it out eventually. I just need to look more into theory...\s\sBut you have to read more theory. Without it your ideology often more becomes a phase. I am in my forties now and my days of being sexy are gone. Saw people come and go. The people of my age and older who stayed in the left scene all know their Marx Lenin Trotsky Luxemburg MaoGoldman and Kropotkin. Most have also read theory of their enemies. \s\sDepending on their main focus for struggle(e.g. environmentalism workers rights anti discrimination) or strand of communism/anarchism (e.g. leninism primitivism) they all know the classics there.\s\sIn my life theory has put sense in me when capitalists may lure you into exploitative jobs. Sooner or later in your life you have to make a hard decision between a destructive job that pays well or poverty/insecurity. Nothing helps then but comrades and theory.>I still have difficulties to determine whether I am an anarcho-syndicalist or a council communist\s\sWhats the differenceI know it‚Äôs a meme now but read theory. Read what people who created and developed these ideologies had to say.\s\sFor the most basic Marxist-Leninist perspective I suggest:\s\s-Principles of Communism Engels\s\s-State and the Revolution Lenin\s\sThe first is a really short essay basically written like a Q&A the second is a pretty short book which contains the basis of Lenin‚Äôs thought and his criticism of social democrats and anarchists.Haven't read the first but the second is really good. You don't even have to be a Leninist to read it and think ""Oh these are some interesting ideas.""If you're more into the economic side of marxism [Wage Labor and Capital](https://youtu.be/0v_po2nBHG8) is basic but incredibly functional and interesting.Here's the links:\s\s[Principles of Communism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)\s\s[State And Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\s\sI would also recommend [Socialism: Utopian and Scientific](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm) by Engels and [Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/) by Lenin. Imperialism is a good book to read once you've read all the others though. In the area of non-theory I highly recommend [Blackshirts and Reds](https://eastsidemarxism.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/michael-parenti-blackshirts-and-reds-rational-fascism-and-the-overthrow-of-communism.pdf) by Michael Parenti.

The only thing I‚Äôve retained is ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù and only those lines specifically for 0 reason lmaoWhy not both?Communism and anarchism is the same thing but the only difference comes from timing. Communists (or Marxist Leninists to be specific) want to keep the state as what is called the ‚Äúdictatorship of the proletariat‚Äù where the state takes the responsibility away from individuals and abolish class and slowly wither away the state. While anarchists want to abolish class and the state immediately. That‚Äôs why they often fight after a revolution. I might be wrong on some things though you should read into it.As an ancom this has been bugging me for the longest time!Ancom is literally just both\s\sHow in the world is this getting downvoted?\s\sAn ->anarcho ->anarchist\s\scom->communistPor que no los dos?If you don't know what you are you're likely neither one. You're a person with empathy enough to be anti capitalism but maybe you still haven't had the chance to learn something deeper about anarchism or communism. So you should do that. Reading a bit of theory helps you understand better how to act in this world and helps you learn the reasoning behind the idea which helps explaining that idea to others.May I introduce you to anarcho-communism?That's anarchism in this contextIt's probably good if your figure that out because both have drastically different methods for organizing revolution and what comes after.\s\sPrefiguration is especially important for anarchists while being less so for MLBased and uncertain about what precise left-wing sub group I belong to pilledHow would you not know the difference? They're completely different ideologies.Isn't anarchist's already communists? But I understand that you mean Orthodox Marxists and Anarchists. The truth is we're all socialists also Im a Sexy commie then üòÑThere are some non-communist and anti-communist Anarchists. Like Proudhon.I mean you can be both unless you specifically mean statist forms or socialism when you say Communism.I think this is in reference to ML as compared to AnarchismYou can and should be both.SameSounds good but have you tried reading?I get theory can be really daunting to start but if you join a local leftist group they'll most likely have some form of book club so you can read alongside like-minded people IRL\s\sIf you're not wanting to do that I'd recommend at the very least listening to capital vol 1 and state and rev both on audiobook and they explain the basic concept of what it is to be a leftist (capital) and a communist specifically (state and rev)[removed][removed]Well you should probably figure it out because they are pretty radically different positions.Seriously. People should read some books by famous communists and anarchists because they are totally different aside from both being against capitalism. People who are saying they are ""the same"" need to read because the people who founded Communism and Anarchism strongly disagreed with each other.[This position inherently leads to this meme.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DankLeft/comments/q6pvi6/read_theory/hge8q0i/)ngl i expected [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/989/888/6a8.jpeg)Communism and anarchism isn't a dichotomy. You can be both. Communism isn't inherently authoritarian.Communist is anarchic. There are no hierarchies in a communist society. And there definitely is no cult of personality.[removed]Who cares what outdated label somebody wants to give themselves? All that is over. We live in a world of global hyper capitalism and there's very little being done to stop or slow down its trajectory. We need to cut the shit and analyze what we're currently up against from a broader perspective of capitalist vs anti-capitalist. The rest is wholly unimportant until then.State = badAnarchists are communists as much as radlibs and reactionary post-lefts will try and distance themselves from our movement.[deleted]Anti-capitalism on its own doesn‚Äôt make you left-wing hell anti-capitalism on its own isn‚Äôt even necessarily a good thing or revolutionary see monarchism the popular ‚Äúanti-capitalist‚Äù subreddits which are nothing more than doomer circle jerks and capitalist realism and certain forms of fascism. \s\s Left-wing politics are not just vague anti-capitalist sentiment which the capitalist system can neuter or even use to its advantage it‚Äôs knowing how capitalism can be brought down and how we can build a better system out of its ashes.Tearing the system down is not an option.\s\sIt needs to be made obsolete.Literally the same here.Someone wanna explain in easy English what the difference between socialism and communism is? If implemented today. And I guess communism meaning the by the book stuff and not from historic utilizationsEasy to figure out do you read theory or not?SameIf your a Marxist your a communist\sIf not then a anarchistI‚Äôm a Marxist anarchist.More of this less ‚Äúin my perfect world‚Äù bsread me like a book thereMoodI have my preferences but at this point Id take MLM over the current ass systemThe centrist we need!Stop being so fuckin relatable üóøI mean I don't have a super deep understanding of Anarchist and MLM theory. But when more knowledgeable sources talk about them they both make some excellent points. I'll comment in Genzen and anarchism but kinda keep out if the infighting posts. I feel like the power consolidations of MLM theory has the potential to crush capital but Anarcho theory gives people a lived experience of everyone's end state goal of the dissolution of all hierarchy which is also very powerful. At the end of the day though it may have to be the new struggle/war after capitalism is destroyed... If we can even get that. I think you answer the questions for ourselves individually we'll all need to think beyond our own lifetimes before there would be any resolution.\s\sAt the end of the day if you fight for the working class you are a comrade of mine.Don't care much about the labels. Without good theory knowledge and meaningful praxis we are no different than a common liberal who likes the aesthetics of the revolution.This has been me for several years now except the sexy part.

Been wondering myself for the past 20 months or so where I really fall but I don‚Äôt think it matters too much as long as we all agree that capitalism is evilRead [Terrorism and Communism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/index.htm). If you agree with the points [especially in chapter 4](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/ch04.htm) (its like 10 pages) youre a Communist.Am I a communist or an anarchist? Neither I‚Äôm a CIA agent üòéI mean anarchist + communist = anarchocommunist?

Asking for a friend.BofSee (as a self described anarchist) I figure that all illegitimate power is bad. What power is illegitimate you ask? Lol idk.Why is communism being decoupled from anarchism? You can be communist and be anarchist or marxist leninists.Comrade...you can do bothI think that the end goal is Anarchism but we first mist go thru Socialism and CommunismHave you tried Council communism? I find that quite a few people identify with it but have no clue what it isI think that both anarchists and MLs make good points sometimes. I ultimately lean more towards the anarchy side of things but I don't believe that the state can be meaningfully abolished any time soon and accept that state power is realistically the only way to create change quick enough for us to respond to climate change in time. I certainly don't want Stalin 2 Electric Boogaloo but I would honestly be willing to put up with a lot so long as it meant a dismantling of capitalism and a serious (ie fully militarized) response to climate change.Both is goodAnarcho-Communists: Go Go Power Rangersok hold on a moment i think that lower left model might be my therapist?????How about neitheryou can be both if you want we're not exactly about archetypes over hereSame thing. Now the question is are you a Marxist. First read [the communist manifesto](https://www.fulltextarchive.com/pdfs/The-Communist-Manifesto.pdf) then [capital volume one](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf) then read the other 3 volumes of capital.Twist; your both because communism is supposed to be stateless and is completely comparable with anarchy.             \sOr neither because you only believe in some of the core tenants and not the ideology at large of ether.        \sHonestly it's 50/50 ether way.## Be sure to join these lefty subs as well!\s\s|Sub|Who/what for|\s|:--|:--|\s|r/AnarchismZ|Generation Z Anarchists|\s|r/asozialesnetzwerk|Leftist Germans|\s|r/AntifascistsofReddit|Antifascism| \s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

If the means of production belong to everyone then the benefits shall favored everyone.\s\sBut the problem with starting a revolution on underdevelloped countries is that  the means of production were not enough for all the peasants( factories developed mining) or even the social needs like housing hospitals doctors and schools. Because they were for a tiny minority of capitalist owners. \s\s So they deciede to use the dictadorship of the proletariat to try to answer the needs and demands of the people.   . So therefore they develop the industry the land they build hospitals schools houses etc. and they make universal programs. \s\sThey made mistakes because  reality is messy and hard to understand: im not gonna make excuses for some horrible mistakes they made but we need to undestand them in order of not making them again: \s\sfor  example China and the fouth pest campaing or the cultural revolution where   \sinstead of being a campaign for justice against the land lords it turned into a social revenge of peseants. The masses make mistakes   \s\sthis also happened in cuba with the gay rights sexual minorities in cuba during the batista years were easily accepted in habana  they worked in the casinos and hotels of the mafia and american companies. most of the time the were sexual workers and received way more money than the avarage cuban. So it created a social resentment and after the revolution  the fidel governement was againts the american exploiters so the american lefts and this sexual minorities lost they way of life creating and they wanted their of life back so a lot of them collaborated with americans agaisnt cuba.  \s  Betwen this the resentmen of the rest of the cuban people and historical social and cultural social views( unitil the 90¬¥s the WHO considerd homosexuality a  Mental illness  \s ) the sexual minorites were not really welcomed. This affected they service for cuba because after the bay of pigs invation the deciede that every man should spend 2 years in military service to defend their nation. But gay men werent allowed in the military so they send them to the agricultural fields (what you would call  camps) for 2 years.  \s\sAfter the 90¬¥s the cuban gorvenment realised the mistakes they have made and started to pay its historical debt with LGBTQ individual. Since 2008 transrights are fully protected and they consider gender correction surgery(i apologize if this is no the correct term english is not my mother thongue) a life saving surgery.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sso Marxism-lennism shall not be desmised because it wanst perfect we shall learn from the mistakes they made and  but also the advances . No ML wants to repets the societys on 1960's or the 1920's and their social views on gender sexuality etcA lot of what you hear about these 2 is straight up lies by the way.

So the worker is receiving LESS than ONE THIRD of what they do for the company. Not exactly 1/3 not near 1/2. More than 2/3 of what they do goes to bozos.\s\sWhere does bezzy live again?Many Amazon employees live outside of the US - they're a global company. This has no bearing on your central argument I just felt like pointing that out.Not defending Amazon in any way but their minimum wage is $15 per hour.those stats really just said \s\s‚Äúthis ugly son of a bitch is stealing billions of dollars and basically you are fucking stupid‚ÄùProfit is enherently theftAbsurd how I could ask a capitalist why that‚Äôs fair and they‚Äôd waffle between ‚Äúhe works harder‚Äù and ‚Äúsince he founded the successful company he shouldn‚Äôt have to work anymore‚Äù like which is it??Either one that justifies to them that his workers don't get paid in full for what they make.Bezos clearly doesn't make 80 billion a year otherwise he would have 1 trillion in about 12 years. We don't need untrue graphs to show he keeps his employees in shit conditions and pockets the rest. He will shoot himself on the foot anyways people will no longer have any income to buy his stupid products.He has this year. This is also what Forbes wrote. A comrade just added the extra context about the workers.He has 1000000 employees. The other 329 million Americans are able to buy from him. Also most of Amazon's revenue comes from Amazon Web Services which is their data centers.\s>He will shoot himself on the foot anyways people will no longer have any income to buy his stupid products.\s\sThen why does capitalism still exist?Most proponents of capitalism would say that amount of money isn't a valuation of hard work but rather the unique idea they contributed to society and the risk they took on. Wage labor is easily quantified as a finite amount ""unique ideas"" and ""risk"" on the other hand are quantified as ""a share of the cash-flow for the rest of time."" Wage labor is measured in hours but ""idea creation"" and risk are supposedly not really measurable in any way.\s\sThey'd argue that it's not about the value the capitalist puts in but rather the value that society subjectively ascribes to the company's output. This says nothing about the distribution of that subjective price between different levels of the company. Surely society gets more out of the thousands of hours workers put into the ""big idea"" in perpetuity than they do the capitalist initially coming up with the idea/putting together the investment for a much lesser amount of time than that.\s\s**TL;DR: Funny how the subjective theory of value results in finite wages for the worker but incalculable indefinite profit for the capitalist who must be some kind of source of inhuman magic...**This makes so much sense that the numbers come out that way. Amazon has a good business idea of consolidating resources and conveniently transporting them to the consumer. Its a great business model and everyone who works there could live on a thriving salary 78k more apparently.he makes more than i make every month every second. more than i make a year every minute. i hate this fucking man with every fiber of my beingNo one should be hoarding this much resources. And Bezos isn't even the only oneBut he doesn't earn that does he. I'm sure he pays himself very well but not in the billions. That money is the increase in the value of Amazon represented by his shares not his salary.\s\sOf course it's correct that this money comes about because of the work of thousands of minimum wage employees but Bezos shouldn't be the sole target here.\s\sThis is the inherent problem with the stock market. As a company floated on the stockmarket Amazon's responsibility is to make as much money as possible for its shareholders people whose only involvement in this is to have purchased a share from somebody else. They don't do any work they don't negotiate any contract in fact most have never done anything other than shop with Amazon.\s\sThe only interest of a shareholder is the retention of the shares value and the dividend rate. They have no care for staff conditions or rates of pay. In fact should Amazon decide to pay its workers better than minimum wage these shareholders are as likely to sack the board than applaud them.\s\sHowever once they feel they've extracted all the money they can from Amazon these same people are likely to sell their shares let the company collapse and reap their reward.\s\sThe stock market needs to be regulated far better and laws need to back up workers rather than letting them swing.>	the stock market‚Äôs incentives are inherently broken\s\s>	we should regulate the stock market\s\sPick oneWhere are you getting the $78000000000 number?  Last I saw his 2020 income was $10229023304 mostly from AMZN stock sales and his pittance of a salary.\s\sThe closest I could locate for 2021 so far is $6632118019 in AMZN stock sales + 7/12ths of his ~$81800/yr salary.\s\sOf course he was also an early investor in Google and is doing something with all that cash so probably more income floating around but I'd say it's way less than AMZN stock salesHello comrades if you are interested in shitposting learning about MLM/ML or just want to have a good talk join the [discord](https://discord.gg/betvYqzvzk) server!\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
