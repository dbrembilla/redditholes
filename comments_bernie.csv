0,DemocraticSocialism,WayOfTheBern,2122,"I'll believe corporations are people when one goes to prison.And diesEvery corporation is so heavily leveraged in debt because of stock buy backs. They just know when shit hits the fan they’ll be bailed out>This is ~~what we call~~ a dystopia we've been trained and conditioned by our public school system and our Mainstream Propaganda Apparatus to *believe* is a Democratic Republic.\s\sIf we were honest in our assessments of our government's representation of the average American citizen Robert's statement would read more like:\s\s>""No citizen-- not airline employees not hotel employees not cruise ship employees -- should be bailed out.  They can survive by borrowing at exorbitant interest rates using their labor as collateral.\s\s>Taxpayer money should be used to bail out corporations not people.Whores have to pay their pimps.This got a chuckle outa me. One of those “I gotta hand it to ya” chuckles. But if America isn’t capable of pimpin without these corrupt entities in the back pockets of our government then we are doomed. I think you and I both know we could still strut it.Those are key Bourgeois industries and why they will always be bailed out.Those art key bourgeois industries and wherefore they shall at each moment beest bail'd out\s\s***\s\s\s\s^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\s\sCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult` `!fordo` `!optout`CorrectThis is why most Americans don't wanna pay higher taxes and get stuff like tax funded healthcare and tax funded tertiary education.\s\sThey will just use our money for this shit. We basically pay taxes for ' existing ' to our billionaire overlords who fund these governments ( lol election donations ).\s\sThe infrastructure of the whole country is collapsing we are already paying taxes as high as the Canadians ( Alberta and Saskatchewan level ) and we don't have anything that they have but we do have our rich overlord billionaires ! Take that CANADA!!!But corporations are people! Really big important ones!! /sBailouts have winners and losers.  The losers are always the taxpayers and the currency being devalued.Or we can go back to the creative destruction that is supposed to be one of the benefits of Capitalism instead of our protected Oligarchy bullshit system we have.  If you don't want that then FUCKING ADMIT you want government intervention and that yes government is the answer.In my experience “Conservatives” always say they are against corporate bailouts but since they would never turn against their side there are never consequences for the Republicans who vote for them.Americans think that if a company goes bankrupt it disappears. :facepalmWhat are we doing about it? Acting like children instead of finding new ways and methods that will secure our survival in the future. \s\sNews Flash: No one is coming to save us. We must save ourselves.How's that ""We'll push Biden to the left"" strategy going Bob"".Well Democrat Party loyalist Robert Reich did you tell that to NANCY PELOSI SHE'S IN CHARGE!Who else do you think he is talking to?They should have used the so called “Rescue Plan” funds to cancel all public college debt. That would have been the most productive use of the money. The bill is nonsense most of it has nothing to do with COVID. What a corrupt short sighted immoral and foolish civilization this is.This mf spittinLet's just give them back all of their tax dollars.All 750 of them $$$So they now have to repay the money they got under their negative tax rate? Cool. I'm sold.A great and smart man. I love robert reich. I hope y’all have seen Saving Capitalism and Inequality for All on Netflix.Sounds like Robert who happens to be one of the good guys has forgotten what the spine of capitalism is. Exploitation of the closest most vulnerable least protected. And use racism wherever possible.\s\sMy dictionary says dystopia is imaginary. Most of the world wishes you were right Robert.Is he a good guy? He's a vote blue no matter who constantly gaslighting libsI would say no airlines and cruise ships these are big compaines that need huge capital to start - only rich can start this types of business. Hotel and industry *can* be a very very small business - but most hotel are big compaines. My family company is basically an industry we are not rich on what we do it’s the oppesite we are poor because we love what we do. I live in Norway I could drop my family company where I had $6.3 hr rate for 2-3 years and go into supermarket and earn $19 a hr. I think small industry and hotel should be bailed out but big compaines have millions on hand (saving accounts) that they can spend but they prefer not because they rather milk the government for taxpayers money.\s\sMy family company suffer atm many times close to bankrupt but then I have to illegally work long to save the family company. Yes illegal. You are not allowed to work more then 40hrs a week. The norm is 375hr a week here.\s\sJust sucks that we are a company that care about quality and handmade over mass production making ous expensive so we live on hard work.\s\sI know this post is about USA and I’m from Norway. But I see myself and can imagine many USA compaines are in the same situation small newly started or a family company that care about quality over quantity = barely liveable salaries.Is Robert Reich reputable? Jw bc conservatives seem to think he's notWell he seemed to be mostly on the Bernie side in 2020 until Bernie gave up the fight then he instantly went full ""vbnmw trump bad"" with nothing as far as criticisms of Biden's record that I can find.\s\sMake of it what you will. To me it looks a lot like so many others who say the words when it's easy but roll over and fall in line as soon as it's more convenient.\s\sOne of the ""strongly-worded letters"" clan.[deleted]Robert Reich knows his stuff and makes great points on social media. And then tends to use his popularity to usher people into voting using ""lesser evilism"" ""logic"" and simply sheepdogging for neoliberalism. Between election seasons he's great to follow- just don't idolize him or think he is actually on your side. As others said he's a long time Clinton crony.Been seeing a lot of Robert Reich around here lately!\s\sI’m sure everyone here will agree with this tweet:\s\s>	Today Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law.\s\s>	This bill won't just help struggling Americans weather this crisis — it will help restructure the economy to put working people first and reduce the out-of-control inequality that's plagued the country for decades.\s\s-	Robert Reich\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sI like turtles.In what way does it ""restructure the economy to put working people first?"" Another one time check that's less than some people's monthly rent? Maybe raising min wage would actually be an argument to put people first.""restructure the economy to put working people first?"" Lolz. Nah. Then they should have used this funds to cancel all public college debt. That’s the most productive use of this So called Rescue Plan funds.Robert Reich is a fucking joke and a shill.\sStop spreading this shithead aroundHe generally isn't the best that doesn't mean he isn't correct here.Ad hominem fallacy.\s\sJudge the argument not the person making it.It's not about bailing out the travel industry.  It's about not subsidizing all the other less-affected industries like computing tech and online retail.  If you don't bail out airlines you're basically saying that in the event of no virus to take their profits you would have randomly pumped their taxes up to do it instead and done no such thing for the other industries.But Biden is trying really really hard to get a $15/hr minimum wage for **government** employees.\s\sIs that supposed to impress us?People are paid not in proportion to their importance alone but by how easily they can be replaced. Forcing higher pay distorts the market which isn't cool because the market is very good at doing what it's indented to do. It's so good that it will screw people over to accomplish it's goal.  Instead change the market so it naturally produces better outcomes. Replace the incentive to increase shareholder value with the incentive to increase human well-being and the market will find ways of doing that very well.  Think outside the box.Can someone decipher this tweet?""We can't raise the wages for anyone who is underpaid because it would be unfair to all the other people who are also underpaid.""""$600 was a downpayment"" - shitlibs that unintentionally admitted that the two parties are actually just one and the same.If it was a downpayment shouldn't everybody who got that ""downpayment"" also get the rest of the $2000?He bombed Syria/Iraq anyways.Lol and thats why I knew better it was supposed to be a bribe ""vote for me and I'll give you money"" no bitch give me the money and I'll vote for you. That's how it should have gone.[deleted]Yeah sure dictators can be voted out /s\s\sdumb ass shitlibsThe 4th Reich is currently in the WH. Don't be fooled by the rainbow flags.Because fuck you that's why. That actually describes our entire approach to healthcare.Nah. That’s inaccurate and misrepresenting the health care system. \s\sIt’s “fuck you pay me”The pharmaceutical companies contribute to political campaigns.One group has political power and the other doesn'tYeah *""price gouging for all - power to the people!"".*For that matter why is charging $6 for a case of water not price gouging?Because big businesses are allowed to do that. They're supposed to do that it's how they make profit. Them benefiting by charging more is just ""good business"" but if a small business or individual tries to exploit others in the same way they have to be knocked down a peg. To keep them in their place.How much do you think it costs to make a bottle put water in it put on a label then package a bunch of bottles together into a case and ship it to a store and then for the store to stock it and sell it?You could petition your local or state govt to increase water quality standards then you don’t have to buy bottled water. I mean you’re already taxed for it anyways. Make them step up. Oh...I forgot taxes are never used properly and efficiently.Maybe the people price gouging for water should hire some lobbyist and start making campaign contributions.As far as I know price gouging laws in the US are only in effect in emergencies.Then the real question is why the diabetes crisis isn't considered an emergency.Because the price of water reflects actual scarcity while insulin prices just reflect how intellectual property laws are designed to favor the richYeah that's definitely more like a homeless shelterI saw an episode somewhere about a guy in San Francisco living in one of these renting a parking space to use as an office during the day.  This is definitely a weird way to frame this.That young person has money for hats!  Clearly they afford a down payment on a Boomer McMansion. /s[Direct link to this Tweet.](https://twitter.com/nashville_brook/status/1359143201496514566)Sometimes people who have no rent money  ""choose"" to live in a car their own or an abandoned one.  \s\sNo accounting for tastes as the saying goes. /sThis is what happens when you let people like Bill Gates Klaus Schwab Jeff Bezos Elon Musk the media (which the 1% controls) the intelligence agencies (which work for the 1%) the WEF the WHO and other billionaire/multinational conglomerates (NGO's think tanks) decide how 99% of humanity should live and we just accept their bullshit without questioning it.\s\sIf we don't reject their narratives and refuse to comply with their authoritarian desires then this is the future they have planned for all of us. Cages (""pods"") no privacy no freedom to make our own decisions no freedom to decide what we eat what is injected into us or not. These predator don't care about race gender political affiliation - they want to control and in Bill Gates' case cull as many of us as possible.\s\sThose dystopian movies of yesteryear weren't off the mark at all...The WHO? You mean the UN? Are you drunk?Seems to me almost 4 billion people should be able to take 3 assholes on a vacation. To the moon.I’m hoping all the rich flee to Mars or some Elysium type shit and then get a major oxygen leakWhat happens when it gets to one? Does that person just sorta implode into an unstoppable greed singularity? Do we allow it to get that far?It’s like the end of the monopoly game starts moving faster until there’s nothing left for anyone elseWhy can't we just kill them...?So the eight trillion spent destroying USSR which was working on ending poverty was worth it I guess...\s\sDodged a bullet there eh! oligarchy.I feel so bad for the five who lost out!\s\s/sBefore we had to be concerned whether the checks went out with Trump's name on them.  Now we have to worry that literally *thousands of dollars* might end up in the hands of rich people.\s\sIs there like an objective unit of measure for disingenuousness?  If not let's call it the ""Dem"" as in ""the concerns that are holding up aid to the struggling American public measure over 25000 Dems.""How about Decepticrats?Normal people who don't follow politics every day like us masochists will see the long wait and final $1000 check or whatever and be asking where the other promised half went that was supposed to come ""immediately.""

He didn't warn us!  It doesn't matter that any of those other politicians had the info and could have warned us and not only didn't but did insider trading to profit off their special knowledge only Trump can ever be responsible for anything!  Plus Pelosi tore up a copy of Trump's speech!  She's an American hero!  How dare you impugn the honor of a True American Hero!  She *deserves* to get rich off of our suffering!

Pentagon budget is going to be $753b\s\shttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/budget/547412-sanders-expresses-serious-concerns-with-bidens-defense-increaseShort term profits will be the death of us.> The strength of Marx’s critique is that in its breadth of disciplinary and historical scope it managed to identify how the hydra of market economy comes to dominate its operators how Capital rules in the domains of both production and ideology and how via the notion of “self-interest” it diffuses responsibility for its crimes in an incredibly elegant way. The social planning and hierarchical organizational structures humans have built to fight Capital stand out as alien when contrasted with the naturalized discipline imposed by the market in the “free world” however ruthless. Getting over the misconception that these structures are unnecessary allows us to begin learning from the experience of comrades around the world both in and out of power.\s\s\s> To defeat Capital we must understand how it works so we can exploit its weaknesses. As Huey Newton put it: “You cannot oppose a system such as this without opposing it with organization that’s even more extremely disciplined and dedicated than the structure you’re opposing.” An understanding of capitalism’s inner dynamics coupled with careful and broad study of the real history of class struggle will enable us to fight to free humanity from domination by Capital from within the imperial core. Nothing less than this will do.\s\shttps://redsails.org/why-marxism/hoW arE yOu GOinG tO pAy FOr iT?>[The blasted ruins of a dying city. Corpses tanning on boiling hot concrete.

The collectors started calling my grandma who was prepared to pay but told them it would have to wait a month. Collections guy didn’t skip a beat and asked “well how did you pay for his funeral?” She’s refused to pay since and they’ve called her multiple times a week for 12 years.Smart grandmother.  If she paid even one payment they'd say she agreed to take on the debt.  They are slimy bast\*\*ds.There is a statute of limitations on unpaid debt. I believe it is 7 or 10 years - depending on the state (in some states there is no time limit). However she made the mistake of answering the phone which effectively gets the clock ticking again every time she does. What your grandmother needs to do is to check the law in her state on unsecured debt and how long it stays on her record. \s\sIf she does want to negotiate paying it  she should point her intention of filing for bankruptcy (whether true or not). That will get them to come to the table and settle real quick. likely for much less than what she owed.If I ever get diagnosed terminal I’m getting every single solitary thing out of my name then running up a debt avalanche that would bankrupt a small African countryJust make sure it's all credit card debt - not secured debt like for a car/house.  Sounds like that's what you're saying anyway.You get audited before they allow you to go bankrupt and if they see you did that just after getting diagnosed with cancer you’ll be fucked by the tax guys anyway. \s\sBut do keep in mind I’m pretty sure you can write off some medical debt do some research on it but there was a post about it recently about unsecured medical debts.""But why do millenials like hate capitalism...?""Inverted Totalitatianism devalues the individual while Capitalist propaganda puts individualism paramount in the minds of the underclass.\s\sWhat a racket.Racket?  More like pure evil.    We're not a ""lesser species"": we can perfectly perceive what we do to one another to every last starving child.My grandma was a nurse who loved her job and put in insane hours. She was the only income for her household. She was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in April of 2016 and our road was very similar. Banks threatening to sue my grandfather causing him to become suicidal her insurance refusing to cover any medical bills medicaid refusing to help because she earned too much the 3 months previous to her diagnosis and rapid degeneration having to sell everything of worth they owned just to try to get her treatment we weren't even approved for hospice until the week of her passing. She died 6 months later in October of 2016. The funeral home who took her told my grandpa that he needed to to pay $3000 in full for them to cremate her and they refused to release her body to anywhere else who might help essentially holding her hostage if he couldn't pay (thank goodness for the generosity of a friend). The illness and losing her was incredibly traumatic but nothing topped how insensitive and greedily aggressive these institutions were to my poor grandfather disabled and unable to work himself. They cared about nothing but the money and getting it at any cost. It is terrible and I'm sorry you had to experience this agony as wellSo the ACA regulations and policies did not help with her insurance? I know of a similar occurrence with a family that when they were unable to work and lost their insurance Medicaid immediately approved her application and covered all medical bills. She was even able to have treatments at home. They did not have similar experiences with banks and credit because they did not live off credit and their home was already paid for. Unfortunately people do not read the contracts for loans well which explain what happened to your grandparents. In reality if these institutions did not aggressively collect what is owed the requirement for credit would make it impossible for people to get loans. If they did not enforce the contracts too many people would not bother to pay their loans off. \s\sDeath is a part of life and anyone able should make pre-arraignments so their families don't have to face what yours did. It is hard enough to lose someone let alone the stress of what you witnessed. There is free legal services available for those in your grandfathers predicament. It is a real shame he did not know to take advantage of it.Very evil.  Sorry that happened to her and to you.   \s\sA world run by corporations is a world where every evil thing can be justified by a corporation's profit motives and its fiduciary duties to its shareholders.  They have no duty to act in a moral way to customers employees or the world at large so they over-charge customers under-pay employees and pollute the environment.We're all sorry and sorry isn't enough to put peoples lives back together again.What's worse is the people making the phone calls/sending the letters on behalf of the credit card insurance and lending companies were probably doing it just to pay their own debt bills and mortgages.that's true.  in medical alone you have hundreds of thousands of employees working coding and billing trying to get doctors & hospitals paid and a similar amount on the other side trying to avoid paying.  \s\sit's like Big Sports but less entertaining.Do people realize that not one word of complaint put forth on this site has any nexus to the country which spent time and resources saving lives around the world during COVID19.

I truly hope that China Russia DPRK and others come to realize that they must help protect the world from the coalition of greed that is America Israel Britain NATO et alOther countries treat Americans ten times better than America tests her citizensThat's kind of ironic because as bad as America treats its citizens it treats others ten times as bad. A democracy would begin to slowly change that. However a cellular tiered democracy CTD would begin to quickly change that.\s\sYou may not know that the reasons America had Qaddafi murdered was twofold. First he was proposing a panAfrican currency which would diminish America's MIC IMF and IC powers. But perhaps worse Libya had a very experimental party free democracy where the chicanery that is rife in U$ adversarial politics is changed to a cooperative model with allegiance to the electorate rather than a rich thug club like both DNC and RNC are. Libya was the most successful state. Ameri~KKK~a has turned it into an open slave market.What a profoundly evil *America*. ftfyHorrific. As executor of my aunt’s will I still get contact from all these and more over two years after her death. Soulless our society.So sorry to hear of your struggles. It doesn't help that the party which set the stage for the foreclosure crisis and made it worse will now be in power under the man who was responsible for making it worse. We are supposed to believe times will change bec Trump is miraculously gone. However a return to the status quo the invisibilising of people like you are all that these people want to get back to. Watch how they become millionaires by the end of 4 yrs..Republicans are responsible for this kind of shit that you and your mother went through. All they care about is money and power. They are truly evil people.Not so much. The ACA passed as it is now without a single Republican voter.\s\sThey didn't need any Republicans they needed every Democrat on-board and its current configuration is how they decided it would and should look. \s\sI'm not saying the GOP would be any better but blaming Republicans for the current state of things when literally all of them voted against it and it still passed is completely stupid.\s\sWe need M4A but most Dems are legitimately not interested in M4A. We need to stop blaming ""the other side"" for the current mess that was passed by and designed to appeal entirely to Democrats. That it's a bloated bureaucratic mess is exactly the way everything would be if this was a one-party country.\s\sInstead we need to reach out to the more ""real"" Republicans. The ones who are outliers in their own party. A new consensus needs to form.\s\sUnfortunately the establishments mete out the money and are beholden to corporate donations who are not interested in reform.\s\sWolfPAC is your best bet for a start and then (And only then) does the party lose its total reliance on appeasing corporations.CoUlD nOt HaPpEn UnDeR dEmOcRaTs.And you are truly naive if you see only one evil wing of the American~duopoly.\s\sHowever the JoeyKkkamy show is about to kick off. Let's see. Betting against JoeyKkkamy is voting against the burro that is  running against Secratariat.Don't worry.  Things will get better now that the rapist (D) is in office....Well except for the part about being hounded by credit card companies the health care thing and the foreclosure problem. \s\sBut hey there won't be any more crazy tweets so that's something right?First let me say that it is sad that that happened to your mother or anyone else's mother anywhere on earth.\s\sI get a lot of pushback against my commie politics which causes me to ask any who would do the pushing if they are aware of the fullness of reality that not only is this gentleman's mother's experience of eight years ago or today an experience typical of  capital(MONEY)ist America but such action is anathema to any commun(PEOPLE)ist administration. For example while USSR was doing the civilized thing in such cases for three quarters of a century U$ofregimechangeA was spending post WWII the war U$biz's romance with Hitler and largess to nazi helped Franco Hitler and Mussolini destroy the legally elected government of Spain as a kind of ""spring training"" for WWII and like decades later when Kissinger helped murder elected Allende and install a fasci government in Chile which resulted in torture and murder the nazi~fasci Franco Adolf and Benito overthrow resulted in decades of America approved torture and murder.\s\sBut fullness doesn't just define the moment it also addresses the history and the comparative histories of barbaric world's greatest genocide and likely world's most profitable and barbaric rape and torture featuring and torture murder controlled slavery are what causes such as America to invent sins of commie to balance against the mass of criminality estimated by its politicos as perhaps a million or less but by contemporary knowledge is estimated at about 55 million person genocide and that cried out for the fantasy creation of worse crimes from commie. And like the genocide pegged at less than a million or diminishment from reality in the neighbourhood of 1÷100 the reverse is done in the American psyche. As cappie barbarity is reduced by a factor of ten thousand percent commie fantasy barbarity is increased in the American psyche by a similar amount.\s\sThis reality which folks I have to tell you is as obvious as the false flag treason by the criminal regime of POTUS43dubs+dikkk with help from CIA Mossad PNAC JCoS and Larry ""pullit"" Silverstein that is the miracle fest which was perpetrated on 09/11/01 for the purpose of setting the ME ablaze. But you have to look and you have to be loyal to science.\s\sThe entirety of fantasy that is based on the self serving evil called MANIFEST DESTINY which essentially means that it was gawadu's preferred outcome that €uro or ""real people"" should kill off and it not be murder because the ""injuns"" weren't ""real people"". You know ""pink skin"" And that same gawadu favored quarter of a millennia of slavery... kinda puts a justification spin on the barbarity of a victim a week for a century through lynchings and massacres.\s\sIt twar gawadu's weigh. Kkkood knot bee planer.\s\siT wAs GaWaDu'S wAy. It CoUlD nOt Be ClEaReR.\s\sI'm going with 99% and only because 100% just seems impossible. But I would definitely put a big nickel on it if it was on the Vegas book that in a relative sense to a panel of sane and intelligent America's kkkapitalism fails miserably and pathetically from a Judao~Christian perspective when compared to commie but only if one takes into consideration the barbarity of eight trillion dollars in cold war and a mountain of lies that makes Everest seem a speed bump.\s\sIt is beginning to come profoundly clear that from its start whenever you perceive that to be that your relationship with America is exactly what El Hajj Malik El Shabazz said:\s\sAh I say and I say it again. Ya been had! You've been took! Hoodwinked! Bamboozled! Led astray! Run amok!\s\sPost genocide and post slavery America since 1492 or 1619 or 1776 or 1865 has always been and firmly remains the most racist greedy and warmonger nation on earth faring poorly against all but Israel of its barbaric war hawk buddies and compared to any commie country...???\s\sWell it ain't shinola.\s\sOh and the fedkkkops got it wrong. It wasn't Ruskee or  China or Iran. It's Venezuela and Bolivia that are paying America's enemies to act like America's enemies. Are commies and taliban that civil that after two decades of barbarity that was the cause and effect of bU$h CIA Mossad PNAC and zionazi Larry ""pullit"" Silverstein 911 to create Afghanistan attack they have to be paid to hate their enemies.\s\sAmerican exceptionalism...???\s\sAh yes... you betcha...I think you can enhance readability by using parentheses as an aside or clarification.       \sSo for example: U$ofregimechangeA could be “USA  (U$ of regime change A)”.          \sThis way a reader could see the joke but not have to stumble over concatenated words - that can ruin the joke and the flow of the whole thesis.The ACA was supposed to eliminate insurance companies from denying claims. I guess it isn't quite what it is claimed to be. I would suggest anyone running up credit card debt should cut up their cards and live within their means. Blaming the companies that want to be repaid for bad decisions doesn't seem right. When you make a contract with someone expecting them to just absorb the loss when you fail to fulfill your part of the contract is not rational.Exactly! Well said. Billionaires and airlines need to stop making contracts with the government and their\s cronies expecting them to absorb the loss when they fail to fulfill their part of the contract and then asking for welfare handouts when they can’t meet final quarter profits. Blaming investors and clients that just want to be repaid for their own bad decisions isn’t right. It’s not rational. And for god’s sake these big corporations should really be living within their means. What a bunch of beggars.Your same sentiment is how those that suffered under racism feelgonna have to elaborate a little there friendYou can take your IDpol bullshit and fuck right off back to r/Politics you pathetic shill!Unpaid bills and credit card debt does not make the world evil.You've completely missed the point here *entirely*.\s\sBills and credit card debt for life-saving medical treatment most certainly make the United States (which happens to be the wealthiest nation on Earth) an evil place. This country just doesn't care about people unless they're rich and can pay.\s\sThere's plenty of money for universal healthcare to be implemented. They just choose not to because health insurance industry greed and preying on sick people for every last penny is more important to them.[removed]\show do Democrats expect to get enough people to vote for them in '22?\s\sThey don't care and Marianne should know better than to ask the stupid questions on social media that perpetuate the myth that they do.\s\sWinning the White House is just a perk that increases the party's revenue stream for the duration of time they've been allotted to deliver what their investors need from them.\s\sWhen their owners are finished with them they'll return to their alternate role as the #Resistance the party that fights for the poor and oppressed until their services are needed again.\s\sBeing the party in power isn't the goal.  The goal is to keep the people believing that the two party system of Government Inc. still belongs to them and that there are two competing ideologies fighting each other over how best to serve it's citizens.\s\sThey both work for the same people folks and those people aren't the voters they use to prop up the system that keeps their employers in power.  The blue wing of Government Inc. is the poseur that's occupying and defending the space an opposition party would normally occupy in a Democratic form of government.\s\sUntil the American people grow weary of trying to make the best of the bad situations they're presented with every election cycle stops making excuses for propping up the ""lesser"" evil because it's all that's offered and decides to destroy the fake opposition party the guards their owners gates it'll be the same as it ever was.\s\sAnd the days go by.....water flowing underground...Bernie should of been prez.

Also municipalities are required to provide cheap housing.I don't think I'm voting Democrat or Republican again.

I can’t think of anything progressive at all NOTHINGWell him and congress are on vacation after working 3 weeks.[deleted]He let the transformers to participate in sports. I hear it's progressive these days.They won’t even do a one time $2k stimulus.All political leaders are garbage (except bernie he’s my boy)I was going to say you should look outside the duopoly for good political leaders but the duopoly has made sure that it’s practically impossible for people outside the duopoly to attain political power.Their strategy will be Qanon man bad.and that strategy will fail and more Q's will be elected in 22' and in 24' they will have a majority.If only somebody had told them what would happen by voting for Biden...\s\sOh wait many did and got piles of shit dumped on them.\s\sWell here's your shit back eat it.When you elect a ""centrist"" like Biden it guarantees we won't get what we need for at least 8 years because if Biden/Harris do two terms that will be 8 years of no medicare for all or end to the wars and if they lose reelection then you have a guarantee that a Republican will come in and not help us for their 4 years. So either way you slice it you are screwed for eight years no matter what when you ""vote blue no matter who."" We need to stop voting for these people no ""lesser of two evils"" because evil is still evil.We need ranked voting so we can vote 3rd party without that meaning its handed right to republicans if that vote doesnt work outThere better not be a single democrat showing their face in Georgia when the midterms come around. After what they pulled no one should vote for them again.Yep. You're absolutely correct. And they asked for it. People gave them a chance and the very first thing they did was say go fuck yourselves to their entire base not just Georgia. It's absolute madness.It's almost as if they think voting is irrelevant.

There is NEVER a good time to criticize and hold them accountable and when it's the right time and valid they (w/ social media astroturf) and MSM will gaslight you over it.

They stay to the right to lure the right and the left won't vote for Trump 2.0 so... I mean you see the idea right?

Cuck.I don't like the way Marianne is wording this. It plays into the idea that the Democrats are just the hapless but well-meaning Good Guys. They're not. Following their North Star will lead us off the cliff just the same as the Republicans would.\s\sPeople need to accept that the Democrats have **wanted** to be the kinder gentler version of the Republican Party since the 1990's. They aren't actually interested in helping the poor and middle class but their use of that language is a holdover from the pre-Clinton era Democrats. \s\sThey don't care about helping people who are worth less than 7 figures. \s\sThis sort of language that implies that they mean well but are making tactical errors needs to be aggressively pushed back on.Republicans with kente clothMarianne is so close to actually getting it but constantly refuses to take that one last leap.Keep voting blue and you’ll end up with red policies.So true.So then what do I do.She is right. The pandemic will have run its course  despite zero  intervention from 45 and some talk but precious little action from 46\s\sDump  2.0 will likely  be less crude so Biden or Harris will get badly whooped unless the right is  dumb enough to actually rerun trump himself then the fauxgresives may eek out a victoryPretty likely that Trump would beat biden in the rematch.Trump is the most popular choice within  the republican party. Who knows? He could conceivably run for president the next time around. And if biden really pisses off the people they might just  punish him with a second term of Trump. I dont think it's likely but it is a possibility.But but vote blue no matter what?Relevant: https://youtu.be/BKcWTN8f7zQin all seriousness what is the option here? wouldn't you say that we already did that in 2016...and look what happened we got one of the worst presidency and government in American history. \sWhat is the realistic option here? Vote third party? Again that was more or less what was done in 2016. What else? \s\sIn my mind till people like Sanders become the norm there is little that we can do because neither GOP/Dem will fix the things that we need to get better (campaign finance gerrymandering voting rights term limits electoral college etc etc). For now the measure is what party can fuck us up less and the answer to a large level is quite easy: the democrats...at the very least i don't think they'd keep motivating fascism and white supremacy again for now the game is what party can fuck us up less.\s\sin any case we gotta hold on till the younger generation start voting for the AOCs of the future and hope that people like her are the future of this old ass democratic party that needs some serious new blood.And what do they get in ‘22 if they lose? More time to blame the other side for not getting anything done while having already done all the things their campaign donors needed done and preserving the 1% rule. Perfect play really for them.\s /sI think that’s their plan for successIf we're lucky the republicans will spilt.  Then the progressives can split out of the democrats.

There is only the one party of the oligarchy(1%) and they don't care if the D side of their party doesn't win in '22 because they **the one party always wins**... all while they use slight of hand and misdirection to keep you swinging back and forth between the two sides of one coin... throwing tomatoes at the puppets on stage while the puppet master behind the curtain always wins.There's rhetorical wiggle room on $2k.  They passed $2k stand alone in the House in November.  Moscow Mitch shut that down and left us with $600.

Others could argue in good faith that it should be a new $2k.\s\sThe minimum wage is in the House bill and it's not ""Democrats"" that oppose.  It's Joe Manchin and maybe a couple others.

I can’t understand you with my balls in your mouthI worry about the consequences too.\s\sEdit: I get it it’s an opposing viewpoint but realistically speaking how viable is it to just keep giving away money? I get that we already give away hella money to defense and foreign nation not to mention tax cuts and bail outs for the elite but the opposite extreme doesn’t strike me as any more viable. We need some balance in our fiscal policy one that ensures stability for the American people without bankrupting the nation.I didn't know who this lady is. Is she being sarcastic because if so I don't get that. Two of these three things are things that cane up and are supported. The 2k a month I never heard specifically but Yang spoke of UBI which I like. I am not a democrat and don't follow all these people nor am I on twitter. Im a ""own the means of production end capitalism socialist."" The one Trumpian on my Facebook page actually shared this as a 'they just want free stuff post. The left is pretty damn bad at PR and that is where the Republicans make all their ground.    And again where is this 2k a month coming from? Yang talked of UBI but that's as close as it got. Again back to PR little things like 2k monthly that no politicians spoke of is PR ammo for the right.  \s          \s·                    \s          \s-Edit: I reworded a lot of this because people seemed to not get my point.I'm gonna pretend you're not playing stupid\s\sMarianne Williamson - Google   \sIt's not meant to be an insult it's a genuine question.

If you know they're wrong debate them on why public assistance is not just some irresponsible handout that makes people lazy. That is if you actually disagree...The 2k a month has been floated on the fringes since last year it’s a good and popular progressive talking point but we’re still really far away from that. The 2k stimulus check was an explicit promise from the president to win Georgia. They’ve backed down to $1400 and are adding more means testing to reduce the amount of people who qualify. The $15 minimum wage was discussed between Biden and Bernie as Bernie tapped out of the nomination process. Biden was very clear that he would support a $15 minimum wage and that does not look like it’s going to happen in this package. Medicare for all seems to be off the table “Bidencare” is a weak expansion of Obamacare written mostly by healthcare lobbyists. Both parties in Washington are losing support of the people only 30% of Americans believe their party reflects their interests. If the Biden administration fails to enact bold popular policies 2022 could be a bloodbath and 2024 could see Trump 2.0 except not an idiot.I'm going to assume you're asking in good faith and let you know that all those things she mentioned were what the Democrats campaigned on throughout this last cycle.  The 2k checks we're promised repeatedly while they tried to win the two Senate seats in Georgia.\s\sIf you go to YouTube and type in Biden promises 2k checks Or democrats promise 2k checks there are literally hundreds of videos of it. \s\sIf you're asking why people need 2k checks look around and see the poverty and Devastation that is happening in this country both from shitty leadership and the pandemic.  People are fucking starving and getting evicted.You have to realize that just bec trumpians are def full of brain worms that you can’t just base your platform as “trump bad we good” and not do anything tangible and direct enough to back that up. And those issues listed are def those types of platform points that would raise their base. If just trying to play the game according to what MAGAs whine about you’re gonna have a bad time. Hell I’d argue those issues and the lack of them is some of the reason people are MAGAsThe time is always right to fight.this makes me so mad.

We're all heart that way.\s\sNot to mention that studies have shown that housing people costs society less than leaving them homeless. So it's not even about money.The best research on this subject comes from Finland where they practically did end homelessness and saved a lot of money at the same time!\s\sNumerous smaller scale studies showed it would work in the United States too including some done before Finland's national effort. By housing people they found they saved money on police courts emergency room visits and other social expenses related to homelessness which was significantly more than it cost to house them.\s\s[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/12/machiavellian-assault-on-science-poor.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/12/machiavellian-assault-on-science-poor.html)Bread and circuses. Turns out we're so advanced we don't even need the bread for we ARE the circus.Come now the empire isn't dying its transforming into another form. What apparently is dying is the aspiration to a democracy (or democratic republic) in the way we'd imagined when we were taught as kids. As the repubs and dems bow down to their corporate owners the financial holding companies that manipulate markets and media and governments grow ever stronger. Unions are corrupt! Government cannot be trusted! Socialism is bad! BLM are rioting! (but terroristic white nationalists don't exist) are all ploys used to propagandize and draw the noose around the neck of the people to choke our voice.Fearmongering about ""white nationalists"" is part of the propaganda. They needed a boogeyman even spookier than the republicans so now we have the Alt Right boogeyman to convince you to vote for Biden when neoliberals are the ones with all the power and the neoliberals are already white supremacist fascist Nazis anyways.And hunger. And free college.I'd go for forgiveness of student debt first [edit: before free college] because it cripples lives and robs people of a future and would immediately allow large numbers to cover more of their needs in times of hardship. Along with that I'd insist on the basics that all humans have as a birthright: adequate food and shelter in addition to universal health care.\s\sFree college is good as a concept but there's a problem. As a society we aren't addressing  how we're educating people and what we're educating them FOR beyond the h.s. level. Everyone should know how to read write and think critically to the full extent of their abilities. (imo civics US and world history and foreign languages are undervalued) Beyond that in economies based on consumerism and debt with automation bringing a shrinking workforce and rapidly changing horizons for paid employment the specialized knowledge individuals are educated to have and societies need no longer match. That matters in societies built on exchanges of services for payment. We're educating people for jobs that don't or won't exist. The premises of our economy no longer work for too many people.I have literally asked hundreds of people ""What is more evil than getting filthy rich off the sick and dying and then bankrupting them as they lay sick and dying?""  NO ONE CAN THINK OF A SINGLE THING MORE EVIL. As Congress gorges on the blood and flesh of the dead what are we suppose to do? Congress votes to kill millions of innocent people over seas and they don't vote to kill millions of innocent Americans. I think all of congress has a death wish.The US gov is only good at 2 things ignoring the needs of the populous and endless war. Meaning the USA is really good at going out of it's way to kill innocent people around the world for profits.It's neat to see the public at large figuring out what I've known for years.For context the military budget is roughly $650 billion dollars. America spends the most out of anyone. If you were to take the next 8 countries and combine all of their defense budgets  including China you wouldn't reach $650 billion. Now take the rest of the countries in the entire world and combine their defense budgets and  you wouldn't reach $650 billion.\s\sThe defense budget is irresponsibly large. The entire thing is a gigantic money laundering scheme designed to make defense contractors rich.But don't you like your freedom?! We couldn't be any more freer brother! /sTime to start reading [Rubicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91017.Rubicon) to see what we are in for.Now watch us pretend your health and well being matter to us. Wear that mask!Quit politicizing mask wearing.  If the government isn't going to take care of us citizens need to be looking out for each other as much as possible.  Wearing a mask and proper social distancing is the best way to do it and require zero effort to do.Given its death toll Covid is the most serious national security issue.  Why aren’t we everyone we stepping up as though it were an invasion?  Get the vaccines moving.It's been about genocide since 1492 slavery since 1619 and war for empire since just this side of 1865 perhaps earlier. It has constantly ($)elected warmongers and ignored peacemakers like McGovern Mike and Bernie. In 1972 even chosing one who's first three letters mean ""zilch"" and had to leave in disgrace over one who had the word ""Govern"" in his name.\s\sSad to say that America's history profoundly resoundingly says that the vast number of well over 100 million victims very possibly 200 million victims Natives of Turtle Island genocided vicious dictators accommodated  Africans brutally enslaved and world wars fomented were the epitome of obscene profits. The perpetrators of such would obviously rather destroy earth and humanity before failing again like despots Hitler and Mussolini that U$biz did more than any others to create and make WWII a reality.\s\sSo extreme was the nazi sentiment among U$ wealthy that an attempted coup d'etat of FDR by very wealthiest traitors was ridiculed by the propaganda arm of barbaric permawar fasci M$M. M$M which stands for main stream media is the bodyguard of lies that such as U$ war machine has always required and has always received. FYI the perpetrators of ""The Business Plot"" as M$M cutely named it were the biggest supporters of Franco and the overthrow of the legally elected government of Spain which helped arm and train nazi Germany and fasci Italy for WWII. Union Bank of Manhattan was in a treasonous posture from when FDR declared on Dec7'41 until Oct20'42 when they were raided.\s\sUnderstanding of what transpired with Smedley D.Butler the most decorated marine of his day who attempted to bring the traitors to justice and was ridiculed by M$M is one of the most glaring but by no means only examples of proof that M$M is about massage not about message. \s\sIsn't knowingly aiding the enemy during war time even though it was financial treason? Or is that just capitalism again saying we have too many people and not enough money?\s\sI fear the planet is already past surviving the devastation that America and its current allies like Israel Brazil Ukraine Colombia who will dominate from the extreme right or destroy.\s\s9095 was the number of the warrant that was used to bust Union Bank which was rewarded like a hero corporation for trying the nazi overthrow of America.They will need the military to quell the inevitable uprising.we need to prevent more homelessness first\s then triage... \swe have tons of commercial real estate that is empty\s\s some homeless need rehab and serious medical help \s\sthat is the real reason they do not help the homeless ... it is expensive to help the hard core ones \s so cancel rent now to prevent further homelessnessWell how else are we going to stop China aggression in South *China* Sea?Country is too large no autonomy. \s\sMany Canadian provinces gave stimulus and bonuses why can’t states do the same? Circumvent the DC politics.They claim they’re too poor.We replace them all with an army of Berniecrats.\s\sPart #1 Defund every company that gives any Republican or Dem money.  We cut the Achilles’ tendon. Stop giving even $1 to companies supporting Republicans and Dems. \s\sPart #2 Run a Berniecrat against all of them. Force them waste money defending a thousand ant bites.  Drain their time energy and money. Break them.  We keep winning and never stop grinding. Run 10 people in every big city attack relentlessly and then consolidate forces and fold our candidates into one candidate and staff. We win by sheer force of will. We annihilate them. We bankrupt them. We stomp the the Republican and Democratic party into dust. \s\sPart #3 We rebrand what we stand for and educate the people on how spending on people super charges the economy.  We show how it’s working in other developed nations.\s\sWe take the Senate the House governorships Mayorships school boards city commissions.  Once we have the law (Senate) and the purse (House) we fix this broken country. We grind them to dust. We crush the dual political empire. We end them all.Nothing wrong with living under the bridge or going to work corners...dine all that for well over twenty years.This is literally what Andrew Yang has been campaigning for since 2017!!!\s\sWhere was the support during the primaries? Bernie supporters attacked UBI calling it a trojan horse to gut the safety net (it wasn't) saying landlords will just raise rent and it will cause inflation (the Fed just printed 3+ trillion dollars that largely went to the rich). Bernie himself expressly rejected UBI in favor of a federal jobs guarantee during the primaries. Yang was begging him to endorse UBI.> ~~Bernie supporters~~ **people** attacked UBI.To be honest I supported either one of themHere's my question there's 328 Million Americans.  \sWhy does every single American need $2000?  \s\s22 Million underemployed. Who aren't getting assistance. \s\s12 Million Unemployed. Who are receiving assistance plus $300 additional weekly.  \s\s\s\s I don't need the $600. I want the people who are underemployed to receive targeted assistance. Everyone else seems to be okay otherwise.  \s\sDon't down vote or get angry I want to have some dialogue over this point. Maybe learn something. I am not convinced EVERY single American needs $2000. I understand it would be half the cost of our military budget.>Why does every single American need $2000?\s\sIt phases out at 75k for singles and 150k for couples. A simple 5 minutes of research could have told you this.maybe Bernie can donate one of his three houses?(read this guy's recent history for insight into a deflated bag of braggadocio)Ah this tired rebuttal yet again.\s\sOne is his home in Vermont where he is from. The State he represents in the Senate.\s\sOne is a condo in D.C. because he works in D.C. and needs a residence there.\s\sOne is a tiny little cottage bought by his wife with money that came from selling her parent's home that she inherited after they passed away.\s\s\s&nbsp;\s\sI do feel the need to thank you for your brave sacrifice. It's quite obvious that you donated your brain to science long ago and it is not your fault that they misplaced it.“We just gotta get Trump out then everything will be fine.”All the problems are the result of a man that was President for 4 years. His predecessors left him with a country that was united and prosperous. All he did was raise nearly 10 million out of poverty by putting millions of Americans back to work. You can tell he was hated by the record numbers of minorities and Americans that voted for him in the 2020 election Democrats rigged to their advantage. The Democrats will now save us with a 15.00 minimum wage and guaranteed government jobs for blacks paying 15.00 to start health and retirement benefits and paid vacations and sick days as is being proposed. The back bone of the US economy small businesses of course will be a thing of the past and prices will increase along with taxes to pay for it all but that will make it better.The 1% runs both parties and each tells the 99% that the *other* party is responsible for their worsening conditions. Then the 99% fight each other instead of seeing the bigger picture and rectifying 1% tyranny. It is indeed a brilliant two-headed religion held in place mostly by the 99%'s indoctrinated fear of ""worse"" the media (owned and operated by the 1%) and historical normalization (mass apathy and learned helplessness).It's even worse in that they've made sure that one party is clearly better than the other one. There's a reason Bernie was able to run as a democrat and a reason why it would have been absurd to run as a republican. \s\sIf they were both equally bad nobody could be faulted or guilted into just abstaining. But you're almost forced into voting for the lesser of the two evils whehich ends up being not much less evil.Rotating villains.We’ve been stuck here for decades and I’m tired of itSocialism is even older. Countries with dictators and kings were socialist for hundreds of years. Capitalism came about when free countries came into existence. The US was never intended to be a system of political  parties. That came about when the party that is now the Democrats wanted to distort the Constitution and form a strong central government and divided people by race and class with only white men having the freedoms in the Constitution and were pro-slavery. They still divide people into groups. The Republicans believed in the ideals of the Constitution that all men were created equal including blacks and were anti-slavery and believed in a limited central government as the Constitution called for. Democrats are still some what the same today believing blacks are inferior and can not make it on their own without the help of a strong and powerful central federal government.In the United States the top 10% own 88% of all the wealth[1]. The top 1% have more wealth the bottom 90%[ 2]. 61% of Americans don't have $1000 dollars[3]. 40% of Americans don't have $400 dollars[4]. 78% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck[5]. 50% of Americans take home less than $35000 a year[6] (adjusted ONLY for inflation: $29852.28 in 2010 $23574.51 in 2000 and $17893.08 in 1990). The income for the bottom 80% of Americans are actually falling[7]. Before the pandemic 12.0% of student loans are in default 10.0% are in forbearance and 9.8% are in deferment[8]. Only 61% of college students graduate in 6 years (25% if private for-profit)[9]. There are 1.6 trillion dollars of student loan debt[10]. The systems failing. No healthcare for working class no power in Texas because profits are more important no stimulus checks unemployment unable to pay for months etc.  \s\sThe systems failing and it's all do with capitalism. Profit over people: capitalism. When did it fail? That's irrelevant - we need to fix it NOW. To protect human rights and the environment capitalism needs to be regulated - and when regulations continuously fail... History says revolution. \s\s\s\sCitations:\s\s1 - https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/10/08/top-1-of-us-households-hold-15-times-more-wealth-than-bottom-50-combined/\s\s2- https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/nations-top-1-percent-now-have-greater-wealth-than-the-bottom-90-percent/\s\s3 - https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/41-percent-of-americans-would-be-able-to-cover-1000-dollar-emergency-with-savings.html\s\s4 - https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=63253846 (2019)\s\s5 - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html\s\s6 - https://www.newsweek.com/half-american-workers-made-less-35000-2019-report-shows-1539503\s\s7 - https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/\s\s8 - https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/student-loan-debt-and-repayment/\s\s9 - https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40\s\s10 - https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/less-than-11percent-of-people-with-federal-student-loans-are-paying-during-covid-19-.html\s\sInformation is power. Don't hesitate to share.Rich vs poor.  That’s itThe rich want the poor dead. That's it.It's different degrees of ""villain rotation"" but behind the scenes they're all part of the same big corrupt club.They might have on different colors but the Home and Away jerseys are still on the same team.While this is true it's hardly a uniquely American concept/problem as it exists in most first-past-the-post electoral systems. E.g. sure the UK has representation of several parties in parliament but the vast majority are Labour or Conservative as are all recent PMs. And in Canada they have a fairly robust third party the truly social democratic NPD but they too have never had a PM and therefore never truly get to set the agenda. Now obviously these countries take better care of their citizens but that's more an indictment of certain antidemocratic features in the USA constitution (mostly the Senate) that favor the opinions of the elite. And of course even the other countries at the end of the day are capitalist systems with a lot of labor exploitation and environmental degradation it's just the extent to which their governmental systems allow to opinions of voters to influence policy outcomes.For this country to survive we need to have 3+ parties. The 2 party system is tearing this country apart.The only ones opposed to this are blue and red I wonder why?A third party to do what exactly? Be coopted and owned by the oligarchy and their elites? Will this party be pro-capitalism? Anyways.  U can check out the people’s party tho. But I’m skeptical of their values as most leadership works for or rides with Dems...deeply not just superficially.Did some ""proud democrats"" visit this thread to say ""HOW DARE YOU?!?!?!?"" ?1 party system with two branches.The rich 1% against the people.https://twitter.com/garfxist/status/1362835238791995393Smartest thing Peter Griffin's ever said.Sure do enjoy reading this in peter griffin's voiceWe need to end the two party system and implement rank choice voting. Two parties just trying to be random grab bags of views opposite of the other major party doesn't / can't / won't properly represent 330 million people and they don't even try. If Trump makes his own party and the 45% of Republicans who claimed they'd leave the gop for the Trump party do so there could be an opening for the green party or the dsa to become a serious challenger.Not even ranked choice voting will solve the problem unfortunately. Just look at Australia. They’ve had RCV for a long time and yet their government is not radically different than ours. The government does not reflect the will of the people.\s\sNot saying it couldn’t maybe help a little bit. But it is far from the complete solution some tout it as. The real solutions are far more radical and pose a much greater challenge to become realized but nonetheless they are what needs to be done. Things like abolishing the CIA and other “intelligence agencies” wealth caps banning supragovernmental think tanks like the CFR and Trilateral Commission and ultimately abolition of the republic and implementation of direct democracy. \s\sObviously we will never be allowed to have a vote that empowers the people to do any of the above through electoral means. Change has to come from outside the system by millions of people refusing to continue to play by the rules of the establishment.Yes but over 65% of americans want a 3 party system so it's not really going over anybody's heads everybody is aware. Its like if you blatantly do what you're not supposed to you aren't tricking people they just cant do anything about it.We certainly *can* do something about it. It's just a matter of adding to the recognition of the problem a sense of urgency about fixing it.The two-party scheme is repeated in virtually every major western country. \s\sParis and London.global oligarchy\s\sbillionaires don't have an allegiance to a country. Only to their bank accounts.The Merchant class eventually secured rule of the nations.

You think that the international critics of the last few hundred years of capitalism were just trolling with baseless claims?? And never forget The American Political system was established by capitalist oligarchs. And has since been intensified. I hope you enjoy crises because the new paradigm is crisis time.At least with one party certain members of Congress hold fundraisers to help a little when capitalism runs amok.What happens when civilization collapses because of capitalism-caused climate change? https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/lqzlm7/attenborough_we_face_the_collapse_of_everything/\s\sNone of this is going to matter. There will be no political system. There will be no capitalism. Just chaos death and destruction.\s\sMaybe AOC will hold some fundraisers.....It's sort of best described as a burning sinking ship the lifeboats are gone the lower classes are locked down below and all anyone can think to do is take joy in the others suffering (you know good state bad state) blaming the people they don't like for the state of things without anybody thinking to consider maybe setting the boat on fire and setting off to sea with no lifeboats wasn't a good system of travel.Well there's a good chance a third party is coming with Trump Republicans splintering off.  Saw a poll the other day that almost 50% of Republicans would support a Trump third party.that just means Reps will struggle with how to appeal to ""those people"" thus to keep them within its confines.  the Chamber of Commerce class was able to make an alliance with the damned Evangelists.  so why not the tRUMPistas?\s\sthe Reps looked like they were going to meldmerge with the Dems over the Capital hoohaa but they relish their importance and roles too much to give it up entirely.I am trying to help build Reform party which is a moderate party. I have been trying to capture a lot of the disenfranchised people from the left and the right. \s\sI really like that this party has the belief that no one party should have a deciding majority that we should be working as a coalition that the barriers to entry for new parties and new candidates should be low and that money should be unlinked from electability.There won't be a Third Party spit. Trump will be running the Republican Party for years to come McConnell's faction will lose and they will get even crazier. \s\sThat is because the Republicans only opposition to their policies is politically powerless and the 'fake opposition' Democratic Shit Liberals are their business partners.\s\sThe Republicans will be back in charge of Congress in 2022 simply because the Democrats are circular firing squad who can't even deliver on $2000 checks and $15 minimum wage. \s\sThe Republicans' policies are crap but their political tactics are brilliant compared to the feckless lazy useless spineless  shit-eating worthless corrupt losers known as the Democratic Party.r/RanktheVoteYepIt was an organic develpoment that grew up alongside the development of capitalism in the USA not a top-down scheme imposed by some nefarious political class. Let's be realistic in how we approach history.'Organic development'\s\sAs if money plays no part in the perpetuation of the fake two-party system.> ...not a top-down scheme imposed by some nefarious political class.\s\sLOL.  Dude.  Our entire system was a top-down scheme imposed from the very start by the bourgeoisie and their puppet bureaucrats and coded right into the constitution and other legal and economic foundations of society.  You'd have to be living under a fucking rock and stuffing wads toilet paper in your ears continuously to not realize this.  Did you get your ""history"" straight from good ol' PragerU or something?  Whew!That's an assumption.It can be both. This is largely the natural result of capitalism but let's not pretend it wasn't accelerated by the wealthy owners / operators of both parties.Let's be realistic: Citizens United.\s\sEdit: I misunderstood the original post. This person is correct - I am keeping the original for context to the responses. Citizens United was decided in 2010 and has very little to do with development but rather far more to do with today's modern ruling class.It organically developed as a result of the people in power benefiting more from letting the system break than fixing it.Your approach to USA history is nonsensical. The American Political system was established by capitalist oligarchs. And has since been intensified. I hope you enjoy crises because the new paradigm is crisis time.Nope it was not invented by capitalism when political factions predate America. Corruption is a problem of excess human greed.>excess human greed\s\sCapitalism explained in one phrase.Your statement seems to assume that America invented “capitalism”. This is false https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalismIt’ll not failIt's already failed. It doesn't protect the people. The point of any government is to protect it's people - and the US government can't do that. When will it fall - that's the question. Will the 1% realize the inequality they've great is too much and start to protect the people - or will the 99% realize first?What the blank does capitalism have to do with the 2 party system and when the blank did it fail?When the penalty of a crime is a fine it's only a crime for the poor.It’s failing[deleted]Okay CommieThink this says more about you than people criticising the system. It's not either or. \s\sUS can continue under the current mixed society without going full blown communism; the solution to duopoly doesn't have to be abolishing democracy altogether. More political parties and more de-programming people from Vote Blue/Red No Matter What zombie electorialism would also solve the problemOk sophomore.Bernie is not good for the dems' corporate masters.Take a look at the coordinated effort to smear mislabel and discredit him online and how massive it is. Yang is very clearly hitting a sore spot NeoLiberals can't stand to see.Anything that goes outside the party channels will be attacked by the parties. \s\sThe party requires opposition so the other party is a party.  They share power as long as they both exist in a vacuum.  \s\sSo they protect each other from the people and from any other party.  \s\sIt’s is the same kind of vested interest advantage that all vested interests purchase for themselves once they have enough power.  \s\sIt’s time it stopped but you know people suck.Is it consensus amongst the mainstream Dems at this point that they also did it in 2020? The fact that Kamala is vice president and Buttigieg is SoT suggests there is merit to the theory. Pete and Amy dropped out while Warren stayed in to hurt Bernie right before Super Tuesday. Biden got the Obama/Kamala endorsement right on time and with everybody else out Biden became the de facto nominee even though Bernie was leading.Didn't yang also endorse Biden?Near as I can tell it was more backstabbing media collusion and back room dirty dealing in 2020 as opposed to balls-out fraud like in 2016.  The only obvious exception being the handling of the Iowa caucus results.  They weren't even being coy there the Buttigieg-aligned company that tallied the results was called Shadow Inc.>The fact is the Dems should have let Bernie and Hillary go at it fair and square in 2016 which Bernie probably wins. And Bernie probably beats Trump in ‘16. The Democratic Party sometimes has very anti-democratic impulses.\s\s> Do the failings of the Democratic Party have something to do with the rise of Trump? Sure. Will they change tacks in ‘24?  Probably not.The Democratic Party feared a Bernie presidency.\s\sIf Clinton won the Democratic Party keeps doing their thing.\s\sWhen Trump won the Democratic Party kept doing their thing.\s\sIf Bernie won he would have turned around and gutted the Democratic Party.  That's what they didn't want.  That's why Hillary's win was engineered.absolutely right.  Not only that Bernie threatened the entire status quo and the codependent relationship between Establishment Dems and Republicans.What do you mean by ""gutted""?Funny thing is that Trump did the exact same thing to the Republicans and it was accepted with open arms. \s\sGotta remember this country doesn't just *lean* right it basically embraces it.No. Not true.Finally Yang says something. Why the ""mainstream"" are always slow to the news.They say it when it no longer matters. He'll change his tune later on this year.Yang's happy to speak up now that saying anything won't threaten establishment power.  He's speaking now to garner credibility with the kind of people he wants to sell out against in later election cycles.\s\sRemember when Yang dropped out to endorse Biden and take a CNN anchoring job?Ok but he still folded under Biden[deleted]be careful I have been banned from two subs just for linking a news story about Kamala. Saying anything negative about her makes you a racist sexist.She's almost a blue Sarah PalinI think Ron desantis will run for the Republicans and win their vote. Maybe trump but I think the Republican Party won’t want him to represent them after January 6th[Bernie Would Have Won](https://youtu.be/moNHfeBJ81I)One of the more interesting “what-if’s” for me is if Bernie ran as an independent in 2016. Sure it would’ve handed the election to Trump but he won anyways. It seems to me that this would have at least formed a voting bloc to be reckoned with which could have actually driven change within the Democratic Party.I forgot Yang after the Biden endorsement but BlueMaga's pretty angry over this and I think that's just great 😃If Bernie won would they make more money? I don't think so. Hillary was essential for them whether she won or lost.Ok now do 2020Primary was rigged.\s\sThey screwed Bernie and Yang out of a fair chance.\s\sIf they had a fair primary Biden still might have won. Even if my preferred candidate didn’t win I would have been ok with it.\s\sThat’s not what happened.\s\sEdit: Tulsi tooThe Democratic Party is corrupt beyond repair I think. Bernie wasn't playing along as much as they wanted. He still endorsed Hillary but that wasn't enough for them. They need someone who is a 100% puppet. Biden is very good at thatSaid the man who ran against Sanders in 2020 and endorsed Biden after dropping out.He didnt endorse anybody until it was mathematically impossible for anyone to beat BidenUnless Biden finds a way to actually do something Trump is def gonna win in 2024. The Dems are too weak to actually try to charge Trump criminally.If they were wise they’d have Biden announce that he wont run for re-election and rig their own primaries in favor of a Elizabeth Warren type candidate that is a politician that has the policies and platitudes of Bernie while still softening the rhetoric for the older crowd who still see Socialism as a dirty word. I wouldn’t like it and they’d still be in the pockets of the DNC and corrupt as hell but that’s their best move for 2024. \s\sI don’t think Biden can win a re-election unless the Republicans completely shatter or fuck up by forcing a bad imitation of Donald Trump.Why do socialists align with the DNC? All that happens is they parade them around saying ""see we're the tolerant class."" Then tell them to sit in the corner.Don't rig it. That's what lost Bernie in 2016. Let the people speak.He has a good point but where was Yang when he was helping bamboozle Bernie in 2020 to help make sure they nominated Biden before Bernie could mow him down in more primaries?\s\sDon't. Trust. Yang. More. Than. You. Can. Throw. Him.Ooof I forgot about that. That being said Yang is right about one thing a populist is what America needed. You had Bernie and Trump two populists. The moment they rug pulled Bernie installing an establishment candidate the populist won.\s\s**This isn’t a fight between democrats and republicans this is a fight between populism versus establishment (status quo).** I just hope that in the midterms more populists get voted in and the establishment incumbents are primaried out. \s\sReddit used to be about the little guy but has quickly become pro-establishment with all the China bucks. \s\sPopulist movements work it worked in 2016 a populist broke the establishment I’d be happy with a 2024 populist....dropping out for a CNN gig lol.  Yang is such a piece of shit who wants in to the fold so badly.I don't think he's skinny either.I don't hate Yang but this is the same guy who officially endorsed Biden over Sanders when he withdrew from the election. He's not really in a place to talk.Yeah he's full of it.  Saying this in January of 2022 is useless.  Where was he when it could have made a difference?  Same place as Warren.yup ran straight to CNN and started sharing ""his math"" on how Biden was the only choice completely sold out.Wasn’t that part of the agreement everyone needed to sign? Tulsi did the same thing.He was blackballed from doing it by the democratic party (... is my theory). Look what they did to Tulsi Gabbard this election and look who she supported in 2016. If Yang wanted to run again he had to endorse Biden but it sucks you're right.It's amazing how he talks about as if it wasn't total corruption and brutality dictating those events...As much as Trump is a POS the Dems need to also take accountability and purge their bad apples a large groups of Dems are going to vote third party and I think for the first time they might actually get it done \s\sOne good thing about my generation is we generate a lot of momentum in the polls but one things for sure we need to get rid of scumbags in our party>we need to get rid of scumbags in our party\s\sLitterally most federal dems. \s\sI don't see it happening. The establishment wins by disenfranchising voters. There are people who will never vote again because of Biden. They didn't vote for Joe Manchin as president and now realize the farce that is american democracy.> one things for sure we need to get rid of scumbags in our party\s\sIt will never happen.\s\sChanging the party from within is never going to happen.It was accomplished with one phone call.  Still pisses me off.[deleted]Damn. Never thought of that one. If the Yang with good instincts had been Bernie's VP that would have been a very interesting WH...Not impressed by Yang. He will never get a dime from me.Money for what? Isn’t he just a talking head now?NahAndrew Yang's appearance on Ben Shapiros Sunday show got me out of my right wing conservative bubble. Love him!That was civil as hell. As different as they are I feel like Ben and Andrew would get along as people.Good for you man. More people need to do this. I saw Shapiro on Joe Rogan and thought he handled himself well. While I mostly disagree with the man he did make some valid points.His interview on Rogan plus the endorsement also had a huge impactOK but fuck Andrew Yang.  He is saying this now because his credibility is in the trash.  He shouldn't have ran in 2020 and should have supported Sanders.  This guy is a *huge* grifter.It's the ""sometimes has"" that causes me to roll my eyes and stop caring what he does or says.\s\sStill wanting the inside track.\s\sDems are corrupt and rig elections widely. Often.\s\sIf he cannot or WILL not say that then he is playing inside their lines and corruptible too.I never saw any proof the elections were rigged...Jeez talk about being nitpicky.\s\sYou do realize that not even Bernie Sanders himself has ever said that?Andrew yang… grifter like the rest.  Did he pledge to donate his POTUS salary i wonder?  Ooooooor. Was he just another pocket filler?  \s\sWhy do people fall for the obvious shitbags.Democrats are no better than Republicans. They obstruct real change.\s\sThey prevent any challenge to Republicans.\s\sNever vote blue. Never vote red. Elections and voting are a  distraction.If you spend very little time thinking about elections and don’t let them distract you from the real work that has to be done why not vote blue? Makes people’s lives marginally better in the short term (not by enough but better); plus if Democrats have power and still fail (as they always do) it radicalizes normies very quickly. Biden’s failing to deal with Covid has done more to radicalize my very liberal parents than anything else. If Trump were still president I know they’d just blame him.I often wonder about how 2016 would have gone if the DNC hadn't shafted Bernie. He would certainly have had my vote.\s\sOn the other hand I preferred Trump to HRC any day.It's the reason I don't consider myself a democrat anymore. I don't know what I am anymoreShort of the Trump campaign pulling an enormous scandal out of their hat that the Clintons couldn't find Sanders absolutely would have won in 2016.  Assuming he made good on his pledges and was aggressive with the holdouts in Congress the US would have been entering the pandemic with the fledgling Medicare for All having just got off the ground a much higher minimum wage an essentially eliminated student debt burden a somewhat (not hugely) reduced military presence overseas freeing up resources for dealing with disaster domestically and a lot of fresh faces in a potentially energized House and Senate because a bunch of them would have been torn to pieces in primaries for being little shitheads trying to rob the public of healthcare.\s\sSounds like a fairy tale but if Sanders did what he said he would do and the enthusiastic support didn't suddenly dry up the country would be a massively different place.  I'll never forgive the Democrats for deliberately choosing to kill tens of thousands of Americans year on year for the sake of Clinton's vanity instead.Same.  Hillary was CLEARLY the greater evil.Unfortunately Yang will probably say something shitty tomorrow. Every time Yang says something good he disappoints you the next day by saying something bad.Could you elaborate by any chances please.  \s\sHe was absolutely silenced during the last elections wasn't given a fair platform during the debates.. had a very big following. I do think their manifesto is insanely detailed and forward thinking - read it all. \s\sAre we really shying away from people because of a few shitty posts.. worse..possoble fair statements you disagree with..It's OK to disagree with a leaders stance ..not everything a party stands for is going to represent you 100% of the time.. ever.Couldn't agree more.. I commented on a post here a whole back about how absolutely stupid and a dick move it was for Bernie to step down and ask voters to support Biden. \s\sWhat an absolute cop out.. I know intentions were good. But really what he was saying was.. I'm still a lapdog even though I want freedom peace and liberty for all. \s\sHonestly I wish he was running again.. I really do. \s\sTrump is going to win it.. let be honest. You'd have to be silly to bet against Trump when the democrats are in such a mess and Biden .. omg.. let's not even go there. 😥Trump had his own fans booing him for recommending the vaccine 2 months ago.

Because women don't fight in wars.\s\sThey thought it was ""okay"" Hillary's biggest backers were wall street banks.\s\sWhy? Because corruption is more acceptable to the DNC than Sanders.\s\sAndrew yang is totally on point.Women actually suffer more from war because they lose husbands and sons.Yo u/sexydoordasherdude do you have any sexy door dash stories to share with us> Clinton girls\s\sThose were the PUMAs and like the acronym implies Dem party loyalty went out the window - I can respect them for that.The Democrats aren't democratic.

What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism! But more of this later.\s\sThis is an excellent quote that applies to so many things right now\s\sFor example the stereotypical ""reddit socialist"" that case more about ""ableism"" than material conditionsCan we do a larger discussion on this? I find this book fascinating. \s\sFinally I have found something that articulates why I find the concept of the ""Tyranny of the majority"" so repugnant.Andrew is a little slow on the uptake.Right he’s basically stating the obvious to anyone who has a brain at this point. \s\sI still appreciate it thoughHe’s just pivoting to a new business model for himself. Even if he is correct.Thing is if Bernie is still unable/unwilling to call out the rampant election fraud in the system he stands no chance of ever winning. They cheated both times the first time was so brazen it makes my stomach churn. The second time he made enough mistakes that it wasn’t as obvious. But both times he did not stick up for himself or his base so I have a hard time believing he’ll ever get in the White House at this point.Dem donor Lloyd Blankfein said he would support Joe Biden in 2020 but he and his class would support Donald Trump if Bernie Sanders or anyone like Bernie Sanders got the nomination.\s\sI wonder how Mr. Yang reconciles this with his comments about the ""Democratic Party.""  Maybe he was unaware found it insignificant thinks there's any way to not support the interests of Goldman-Sachs Raytheon Citi Pfizer Exxon/Mobile Comcast etc.\s\sNo Mr. Yang please continue. You were saying?Yang is talking about 2016. Bernie won the unDemocratic Party primaries in 2016 he just wasn’t declared the winner due to the rampant and numerous election fraud committed by the party to get the “win” for Hillary.\s\sTPTB were shocked at Bernie’s movement and Trump was in 2016 reviled by the official Republican Party that I think Bernie would have beaten Trump because I’m not certain that TPTB wanted Trump anywhere near the WH as the whole Russiagate was created to control him. Trump was/still is a loose cannon and if the alternative was Bernie they (TPTB) might have been more comfortable that  Bernie was an experienced enough politician and he DID vote for military interventions (  TPTB only care about that because when Trump acted against Venezuela even Democrats liked him ). So yeah in 2016 Bernie could/would have beaten Trump. \s\sNow 2020 is a different matter because Trump actually had grown his base of rabid supporters that TPTB had to use election fraud to install Biden. \s\sBut 2016 was different. It was a sea change election and the American people were denied.Posing this fact as a question is weak. \s\sThe failure of the Democratic Party caused the rise of Trump. They will not change in 2024. \s\sTrump or another fascist will be elected in 2024 again because of the failure of the Democratic party.\s\sDemocrats destroy democracy.U don’t know these as facts. They are supposition and speculation not absolutes.Bout damn time someone attacked the Dem establishmentSpeaking as a conservative I don't agree with Yang but I do believe he acts in good faith and believes most of his public positions. I didn't particularly like many of the democratic primary candidates but he was one of my two favorites because he seemed to have fleshed out ideas.His UBI idea was not flushed out. I heard that and instantly didn’t want to hear anything else he said.When he raised his hand with everyone else on stage for ""universal healthcare of illegal immigrants"" he lost me.\s\sAt least with UBI there is an economic argument even if I disagree with him. But Yang pandered when he could have stood out.GOP wants to end democracy DNC wants to manage itGop is not against all democratic process\sDnc doesn't understand democracyI’m libertarian-ish and I second this 🙋🏼‍♀️Yang is a loser crybaby though. ""I'll just go make my own Democrat party!""To be fair the Democratic party is a graveyard for progressives so abandoning them is a good idea.Soooo much easier to speak the truth when it doesn't cost ya anything right Andrew?And Bernie broke my heart when he endorsed Hillary after he dropped out in 2016.Is he insinuating that Bernie or his family was held at gunpoint unless he told the truth about Assange and the rigging? Unless that’s true then fuck Yang and fuck Bernie even more for playing along with Democrats. Hell even if it is true fuck ‘em.[One Good Shot against the establishment. ](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/dmw1zi/you_get_one_good_shot_at_the_establishment/) Then they either turn you  or burn you. \s\sSame applies for Trump.Bernie would not have beaten Trump in ‘16. Also democrats don’t want Bernie Sanders as president lolHe would have won. Many anti-establishment voters especially in the rust belt that went to Trump just to despise Hillary would have voted for him.The only reason Bernie wouldn't have won is the same reason he didn't win: because his own party sabotaged him in favor of literally anybody else.All the polls had Bernie beating Trump by 10+ points. Some as high as 15. \s\sThose polls were wrong!\s\sNope. Those same polls remarkably predicted Hillary's popular vote margin over Trump. Say it with me. Bernie would have won!Unfortunately I agree with you. Too many reactionary hogs on both sides. The Republicans would have played the defense against socialism card hard.However if Hillary - who actually won the popular vote if you recall - had taken office oversaw a booming economy acted prudently and decently with domestic and foreign policies and dealt swiftly and decisively with the pandemic she would be in her second term right now and people would hardly remember Yang as anything but a recently failed candidate for NYC Mayor. Spouting convenient ‘what-ifs’ for cheap applause doesn’t erase the Trump years and what it’s done to this country regardless of how one feels about the Democratic Party.> if Hillary - who actually won the popular vote\s\sHillary’s winning the popular vote is as irrelevant now as it was in 2016 became popular vote is not how the US chooses Presidents.   However the Electoral College  usually agrees with the popular vote except in cases of very close elections.  The factj that the popular vote was as close as it was only highlights what a wretched candidate Hillary was given that ahe was running against an imbecile like Donald Trump.   And yet the DNC and nearly every superdelegate insisted time and again that Hillary was a fantastic candidate.  My Senator endorsed Hillary for President in 2014 for fuck’s sake long before Hillary even declared.  \s\s>had taken office oversaw a booming economy acted prudently and decently with domestic and foreign policies and dealt swiftly and decisively with the pandemic she would be in her second term right now\s\sThat’s a big If because 1. Hillary was so horrible she lost the election to Donald fucking Trump 2.  Hillary has shown time and again that she has awful judgement which was certainly not going to change once she got her hands back on the reins of power.   I mean Hillary said that she supported a no-fly zone over Syria at a time when Russian planes were flying over Syria.  A no-fly zone would likely have started a hot war with Russia.  Moreover she also said that cyberattacks should be met with a military response and Hillary made it quite clear that she believed that Russia had hacked the DNC server and released the party’s emails.   I expected a war with Russia during her first term.  So saying that Hillary would be in her second term after governing prudently and decently is patently absurd.  Hillary has never been prudent nor decent.  She is and was an openly corrupt warmongering pathological liar.>acted prudently and decently with domestic and foreign policies\s\sHillary ""Henry Kissinger is my beloved mentor"" Clinton?\s\sHillary ""Single-payer healthcare will never ever happen"" Clinton?Bernie wouldn't have beaten Trump.Perhaps not but at least that while still leaving us at square one would mean the DNC is acting slightly ‘democratic’ and isn’t rigging primariesTrump was always Clinton's stooge.

But Sanders chairman of the Senate budget committee and one of the nation’s most prominent progressive voices said **“People can understand that you sometimes don’t have the votes. But they can’t understand why we haven’t brought up important legislation that 70 or 80% of the American people support.”**\s\s>Sanders spoke to the Guardian on 6 January **the same day he issued a statement that the best way to safeguard our democracy is not just to enact legislation that protects voting rights but to address the concerns of “the vast majority of Americans” for whom “there is a disconnect between the realities of their lives and what goes on in Washington”.**\s\s>He said millions of Americans were concerned with such “painful realities” as “low wages dead-end jobs debt homelessness lack of healthcare”. **In that statement he said many working-class Americans have grown disaffected with the political system because “nothing changes” for them “or if it does it’s usually for the worse”.**\s\s>In the interview Sanders repeatedly said that Democrats need to demonstrate vigorously and visibly that they’re fighting to improve the lives of working-class Americans. “The truth of the matter is people are going to work and half of them are living paycheck to paycheck” Sanders said. “People are struggling with healthcare with prescription drugs. Young families can’t afford childcare. Older workers are worried to death about retirement.”\s\s[snip]\s\s>Sanders voiced frustration with the lack of progress on Biden’s Build Back Better legislation which the Democrats sought to enact through budget reconciliation a process that requires only a simple majority to pass. That effort was slowed by lengthy negotiations with the centrist senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona – and then blocked when Manchin said he opposed the $2tn package sparking leftwing fury and deep frustration in the White House.\s\s>**“We have tried a strategy over the last several months which has been mostly backdoor negotiations with a handful of senators” Sanders said. “It hasn’t succeeded on Build Back Better or on voting rights. It has demoralized millions of Americans.”**\s\s>**He called for reviving a robust version of Build Back Better and also called for holding votes on individual parts of that legislation that would help working-class Americans. “We have to bring these things to the floor” Sanders said.** “The vast majority of people in the [Democratic] caucus are willing to fight for good policy.”\s\s>**Sanders added: “If I were Senator Sinema and a vote came up to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs I’d think twice if I want to get re-elected in Arizona to vote against that. If I were Mr Manchin and I know that tens of thousands of struggling families in West Virginia benefited from the expansion of the child tax credit I’d think long and hard before I voted against it.”**\s\s>Sanders also called for legislation on another issue he has championed: having Medicare provide dental vision and hearing benefits. “All these issues they are just not Bernie Sanders standing up and saying this would be a great thing” he said. “They are issues that are enormously popular and on every one of them the Republicans are in opposition. But a lot of people don’t know that because the Republicans haven’t been forced to vote on them.”\s\sYeah he's being more ""political"" about it than we are but we're saying the same things.> “If I were Senator Sinema and a vote came up to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs I’d think twice if I want to get re-elected in Arizona to vote against that.

We built the Interstate highways then a single income could support a family of 4 on the regular.\s\sWe've had trickle down for 40 years and the results have been absolutely dismal by every metric.Not taxing the rich still increases prices for the poor so let's tax them anyway yeah?When we were taxing tne shit out of the rich people could afford a modest home wife multiple kids on a single worker's pay.Because he owns Amazon stock it’s not cash. \s\sRaising minimum wage hurts the most desperate. \s\sWhy should a minimum wage worker’s salary be compared to 30 percent of the value of Amazon? \s\sThis is shamefully stupid.Here comes the Bezos Brigade with the Stocks aren't wealth bullshit like clockwork.I agree with you when people share these things about Musk and Bezos. They act like they are magically getting money if the share price drops their net worth drops. \s\sI think the thing everyone can agree on that as our nation's GDP and productivity continues to rise along with higher demands on workers then why aren't wages? \s\sPeople cite inflation and higher costs but Id argue the monetary policy of the past 15 years is more to blame for inflation. Wages stagnate and purchasing power loses value eventually we have to do something. Kicking the can down the road even further will cause the solution to be even more disruptive.  \s\sThats why ive become a bigger fan of the idea of UBI. Automate what you want cut costs and be more productive the people they will need to work there will be paid better bc they wont need to and instead chose to work and there will be less of them. Probably see bigger swaths of people starting their own businesses maybe what they would do as a side job now can be their real job to make some extra money for vacations and streaming subscriptions.  Corporate taxes will rise hurting stocks but better growth and productivity will help stocks. \s\s More people with more money to spend buying those super efficiently produced goods and services. More people not feeling like suiciding once a day. Stonks go up USA number one.How do we prevent Biden 2.0?By abolishing the oligarchy lolLOL This is impossible with Biden Pelosi and Schumer calling the shots.And to think there are people who disagree with this list... Quite the world we live in.> And to think there are people who disagree with this list...\s\sIncluding the new administration.Biden *is* Trump 2.0. We are in a unrecoverable downward spiral.Think higher.\s\sIt's time to build a new ConstitutionBiden admin to US citizens: Fuck you peasants. You get nothing. We just promised things to get elected. Psyche!The most simple reasonable list but so many people are against it.I disagree with number one. There are plenty of people who have 2-6 due to number 1 but the problem is their job is pointless and so creates mental distress for these individuals. If a job is mandatory for all persons than we will create so many tedious pointless soul crushing positions in the economy just to satisfy some pre industrial revolutionary morality that no longer applies to modern living.  \s\sI would truly love a UBI because it would remove from the workforce a whole host of idiots who put in zero effort in their job simply because they need it to satisfy their basic human needs of shelter and food. Plenty of people would happily stay in the labour force in a field they take joy from toiling in and quality of work would go up due to better mindset of workers.This touches on a good point.\s\sIn modern society we could almost completely replace human physical labor with automated production. In a couple of decades it's possible we'll be able to replace the majority of all jobs with the help of AI meaning that the majority of people will have no job.\s\sIn any other universe this would be a utopian dream. In ours it's a dystopian nightmare. Instead of celebrating that the necessity of labor has been dramatically reduced people either *avoid* automation entirely or they obsess about reverse engineering a demand for a new type of job so that they can justify giving people a liveable wage instead of you know just giving it to them.\s\sThis is your brain on capitalism.Go back to Russia you dirty commie!FDR managed to get point 5 pushed through albeit with sweeping exclusions (which have to some extent been remedied since). \s\sLBJ got point 4 partially answered (for those over 65 and not without key omissions).\s\sGiven the extreme changes in employment due to the advances of automation (something that was barely on the horizon back in FDR's day) it would be possible to combine points 1 and 2 with ""An adequate Universal Basic Income"".\s\sPoints 3 and 6 still need work....We need to govern this country so everyone has a good lifePrevent it? We're trying to prevent populist movements now?Here's where someone points out that AOC is a big liar not just about M4A but also about $15 minimum wage.

All talk no results.[deleted]Everyone but the billionaires hording assets benefits as minimum wage workers put 100% of their income back into the economy.  Small business would likely benefit the 2nd most.And minimum wage drives up expectations for the next tier of pay as well.Remember when Republicans wanted to get people off welfare?https://www.epi.org/publication/why-america-needs-a-15-minimum-wage/Reports: This is misinformation.\s\s[Seems like the vote did pass.](https://www.dw.com/en/berliners-vote-yes-on-property-expropriation-but-what-happens-now/a-59070328)\s\sThere is a question of how to go about it legally but the tweet is correct information.Yes. It was a non-binding referendum though. As the subhead to the headline of the article at your link points out:\s\s>A referendum proposing that authorities in Berlin seize and take into public ownership more than 200000 homes has passed resoundingly. But political and legal hurdles mean it may never become reality.The tweet is a good case for r/technicallythetruth all the senate has to do now is debate over the issue and cast a vote so it is not anywhere near the strong example of direct democracy the tweet implies it to beStart with abandoned buildings and lots condemned buildings that are not repaired in a timely manner and foreclosures on real estate companies that aren't paying real estate taxes. Build and rehab as needed creating jobs. \s\sAdditionally one form of public private partnerships of which I approve:  As a condition of building or condo conversion require developers to provide in their apartment and condo buildings over a specified size some units of affordable housing. This also avoids creating pockets and stigma though both are preferable to homelessness. (Restrictions on subletting of the apartments and resale of the condos are necessary to keep the units affordable.) If compensation is required it can be giving in the form of an appropriate break in real estate taxes for a time.it's a non-binding resolution that solves nothingThank you.  This post is so misleading.ITT:  REEEEEE MUH REAL ESTATE SPECULATION! REEEEEEE!""Volksentscheide"" are not binding in any way apart from the Senate having to consult on that. This time it's about the big apartment companies last time it was whether Tempelhof should be used to build apartments - people voted to not build there and a year after the decision top politicians already announced that the city could not afford to pass on so much land to build on. By the way the mean price Berlin got per apartment when they sold it to the very same companies was abou 8000€ back in the day. Anyways don't take this stuff too seriously as it has almost no legal consequences.Based Berlin damnSadly it was just a nonbinding referendum about whether the city state of Berlin should buy those units.Honestly the thing that helped me the most to get off the streets was Medicaid and an addiction specialist. Once I got that everything else really started to fall into place for me. I'm not saying it's not important to house homeless folks but I'm just saying that alone isn't going to solve the biggest issues for a lot of these people. \s\sI think trying to tackle the opioid epidemic installing M4A and treating drug addiction as a medical issue rather than a criminal one is really important. For a lot of people on the streets they already do qualify for Medicaid so the next important step is giving them accessible treatment. \s\sI don't think housing isn't an important part of it but I think there's other issues to address to give these people a chance at long term success. If someone has a crippling dependency and you give them a home they're likely to end up right back on the streets anyway if they haven't addressed their other problems.The sheer volume of leftists and activists that are in extreme HOSTILE denial of this absolutely basic set of real world facts about the majority of homeless worldwide in western societies is downright depressing- and getting scary because they are gaining more and more influence and power over the narrative and govt decision making.\s\sAnd it is painfully clear they will NEVER accept responsibility for the catastrophic impacts of their blind fanatical agendas.(It's only a possible forced buy-out not a seizing but it's still) awesome! Good job Berlin! Guck landlords the leeches of society. Have an uncle that works for the post office \s\sHe saved about $2 an hour for about a decade to have enough for a down payment on a duplex.

Stop the internet!  We've got misleading information on twitter.  Shut it down so we can clean up this mess.  Sorry everyone is just going to have to wait.  \s\s\sNice find SibilantSnake.It is. Tweets rarely if ever capture the nuance of the issue they purport to describe. I wish we could require posters not to use a tweet as a proxy of an actual source where that source is not linked.https://www.archpaper.com/2021/09/berlin-votes-socialize-200000-rental-properties-non-binding-referendum/Berliner here :: you understood nothing comma null. The flats „taken away from corporations „ were left NOT RENOVATED and not put up to SAFETY STANDARDS for years from corporations. Who do you think now have to spend millions to renovate?? The Berlin Senate. Corporations gladly freed themselves from a liability which the People now have to cover and the city of Berlin now it’s poorer not richer. Wake up.Is a single individual person considered “private real estate”?It's only for private real estate firms that own 3000+ apartments.Yes but that's not what the tweet is about: You left out the word ""companies."" Funny how things happen.Omg creamyweren’t those home already occupied though?\s\swhat needs to be done is building new housingIt's not an either/or scenario. BOTH need to happen.I dont care how liberal you are that's fucking theft. If they took your home to give to a homeless person you wouldn't say thus is ""based""Liberals are exactly the people that are upset by this. What do you even mean?Further you should consider:  \sMarquis de Sade in L'Histoire de Juliette 1797: ""Tracing the right of property back to its source one infallibly arrives at usurpation. However theft is only punished because it violates the right of property; but this right is itself nothing in origin but theft""  \sSo in essence you either believe that property is theft in its self or that it is somehow legitimized by the laws in which case this is a lawful transfer of property.  \s  \sBtw how do you think wealth redistribution should be done? Shall we ask the billionaires nicely to stop amassing unheard amounts of wealth?I never bothered to read the definition of private property but I will loudly shout about how Marx stole my toothbrush.No it's called eminent domain. Owning property in a country means that you are subject to the laws of that country. If eminent domain is a part of the law then you signed up for the possibility of that rule being enacted. \s\sThey should have known that before they invested. The investor is at fault for not knowing that.Those properties literally aren't anybody's homes when they're owned by real estate companies and/or sitting idle.\s\sThe homeless are literally the ones who have had their homes taken away.\s\sFor real estate companies those properties are merely commodities to sell.  For the homeless those are potential homes.Don't stand up for the morbidly wealthy to become more morbidly wealthy. That is as gross as demanding someone with suicidal ideation be given more suicidal ideation. It's dangerous and harmful.\sBesides that it can't be theft. Theft requires taking from an actual entity. This is taking from an imaginary entity. Like taking homes from Jesus and his church vs taking from the members of churches. One is using them and the other is screeching about their imaginary friend fighting his imaginary nemesis. If use is less important then ownership. You do understand that they fundamentally could not have earned them through non-exploitive means. They had to short and exploit millions of workers millions to gather enough money to support their morbid greed. That makes it a nasty modern form of usury. So if you got offended about the imaginary friend Jesus jokes you need to be furious about the usury actively being promoted in economic systems. One is a joke and the other is a rampant horrible sin so bad that Jesus lost his temper.This sounds like a good solution at first but it actually turns out to severely worsen the homelessness problem by discouraging property developers in Berlin from building any new homes in the future for fear they too will be confiscated by the government.  That limits the available housing even more so by just confiscating the homes now you’re cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Then if the government itself goes into the business of building houses you end up with unattractive government housing of poor quality that is not well maintained (think E. German Soviet-style public housing projects).  The more attractive higher-end housing will always be produced by private developers seeking high dollars.> discouraging property developers in Berlin from building any new homes\s\syou mean *big* property developers from building new right?  because owner-occupied home builders wouldn't have that worry in this context.> This is exactly how you solve the homeless crisis.\s\sConfiscation of private property is unconstitutional and will make things worse.  Civil asset forfeiture is bad enough.  Dan is praising theft by force of government but I bet he'll be singing a different tune if his house was seized by the government and given to some random homeless person.Germany's analogue to eminent domain differs from the United States' takings clause. Although I cannot speak to the nuances. Any German lawyers around?Eminent domain can be used for any thing a city wants. [Public use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London) has been defined as whatever a city says is public use even if they're taking one person's land (after paying them of course) and giving it to a private developer. So taking something for public housing would be public use and it's not even a stretch. Thank that fifth amendment for that.Ah yes this is theft but the wage theft that happens constantly at all times to all workers under capitalism isn't... because some old rich dudes decided it wasn't?cry moar we're coming for your toothbrushThe non-binding referendum seems to have been about forcing sales by companies that own more than 3000 units not about confiscation.  https://www.thejournal.ie/berlin-rental-property-5558921-Sep2021/   However I agree this is not the way to do it.This is in Germany not the US.\s\sI don't give one shit what Germany does to their own people as long as they keep their tanks parked.\s\sSeize all through private property for all I care....give it to the homeless burn it...whatever.\sAin't none of our business what other authoritarian governments do within their borders.History repeats itself maybe funny mustaches will come back too.Yes great comment!

Also tanking the housing market is great the next step is to simply criminalize rent/landlords and make public housing.It's mental health manifested as drug addiction.  If you give a homeless drug addict a house they'll sell it to get their drug.The housing market values are based on scarcity.\s\sThis move if it ever becomes actualized will certainly lower home values for the expropriated homes as well as other homes in the same market. \s\sHowever the ROI for those who can already afford single family homes is obviously not the priority in passing a law like this. Also I don't see where it says the homes will be ""given"" to the homeless?Until it’s your home they’re “seizing”.Mhm because that's what's happening primary residences are being seized and their owners kicked out to the curb. \s\sBoo hoo poor housing speculatorsAnd ther it is folks!!! The slippery slope of ""democratic socialism"" leading into the depths of communism“BE AFRAID - the rich people might lose their homes and businesses!!”\s\sGood.

The reasons on why they don't go to the doctor are varied but mostly they feel okay so why go.  \sAnd some people are just so over the top on having to pay taxes.  I guess they think that all the amenities that we take advantage of will just take care of themselves magically you know like roads bridges food safety water treatment forest fires.........The problem is it’s horribly mismanaged. We’ve repeated seen how corrupt government spending is. It’s tremendously wasteful. Without reform people will always be against more taxes if they even have a basic understanding of money. Plus just because I have my taxes raised does that mean I’ll get better care? Or will this money be funneled into stock market share prices that our generous government officials loaded up on ahead of time. \s\sI’d like a simplified universal healthcare style setup if it meant better care and efficient spending of my money. But life is already hard enough where $1000 a year could add even more pressure to the inability to buy a house car or other necessities. \s\sNot against the idea of M4A but I am against the assholes in charge of it.not to mention that if its coming out in your taxes then you're not having to use taxed money to pay for your medical bills! I started a flexible spending account last year and feel dumb for never having opened one before. I know that I'll probably spend $500 a year on co-pays glasses dental etc so why not use non-taxed money to pay for it!But if you don’t use all of that money from FSA you lose it so you have to guess your limit carefully.[deleted]Plus you can ask for a raise sense the medical is not covered (and not a cost) by employers.Shoot I already pay around $60 a month for medicare that I can't even use. Might as well up it $23 so that I can use it and not have to pay EXTRA for insurance that will probably deny whatever coverage I need anyways.Another often overlooked benefit of single payer healthcare is that it separates employment from healthcare. No longer will you be tied to a job you hate because you'd lose your insurance if you changed jobs. It removes a major bargaining chip from employer's hands and gives it back to the workers.The people support medicare for all. They don't need anymore convincing.No they don't.The current system's failure isn't just because of the greed of Healthcare and Insurance industries. There is also a risk equation that they must balance. There is a ton of ""dine and dash"" with the healthcare industry. People who abscond after a big medical bill and never pay it etc. Healthcare and insurance companies have to price in the risk of these dine and dashers into their product and that's why it's more expensive. \s\sThis problem will also be eliminated from the system and good customers wouldn't have to pay for bad customers in a Medicare for All system because there wouldn't be any bad (i.e. nonpaying) customers.\s\sAnother costly risk factor is malpractice insurance but Medicare for All isn't going to do anything about that.The ""how do we pay for it"" talking point really means ""how do we (pharma insurance hospitals) keep making money hand over fist?\s\sIt will save every American money period. Also having a single payer prevents companies from price gouging. The US isn't going to take one thousand of your tax dollars to purchase a single EpiPen. \s\sThe ""how do we pay for it"" is just a healthcare racket narrative that's promoted solely because they don't want to lose their golden goose.Well to be factual the insurance companies don’t pay the high prices it’s just a sticker price. \s\sThe high cost of healthcare in the US comes from us arguably over testing for more than we need to. In single payer systems it’s often one test at a time where in the US theyll do lots of tests at once to find what’s wrong faster (for better or for worse)\s\sEdit: this also finds things that may not need to be treated but inevitably lead to more tests and visits.But but will M4All pay for my Ivermectin /sOf course it would people still travel to countries where parasites are common.  There's also still a (small) chance to get parasites in the USA.  People with Rosacea also can have it prescribed since it helps with that.  There's also off-label uses but that varies from doctor to doctor.  Which is true for all medications. For example there's a pregnancy/fertility drug for women that has an off label use to restore testosterone levels in men.  Viagra's boner purpose was off label until it became the reason it was mostly prescribed (it was originally for low blood pressure IIRC). \s\sYes I'm trying to dodge the topical issue here... lolYesI recently had to explain this to a relative…..older….avid Fox News watcher.   She didn’t believe me that yes taxes will go up.   I literally was down to using small number math as as example.  I reached a point that I had to walk away.   \sI really believe that in years to come they are going to find a neuro chemical or gene mutation that effected all of these people.  I hope that’s the case.  I don’t want to believe there are this many completely blind and ignorant humans among us.While your math may be solid your understanding of value may be lacking. More money doesn’t mean better quality and no waste.Citizens United has not helped with getting M4A passed due to intense lobbying (bribing) of congress to not pass these types of laws.Nobody is forcing Democrats to take the bribes.  They could reject the bribes at any time.  Why aren't they rejecting the bribes?I've got an idea. Let's start a website or new Subreddit. We'll call it: \s\s""HEY SHOW YOUR COVID MEDICAL BILLS!""  Surely the antivaxxers anti-maskers and the like will be getting the bills and will get a chance to see for themselves that Medicare4All is a good idea.\s\s Eh wishful thinking. I'm sure there will be some circular logic that will come into play.BuT I dOn't waNt thE iMmigRaNts to bE aBle to gO gEt trEatEd toO.\s\sThere are so many people who would gladly accept a worse outcome for themselves as long as others have to suffer more.Bold of you to assume I could afford or even bothered to pay any of that. My broke ass doesn’t get medical treatment 🤣If you make under $34k/yr your taxes don't go upMath is hard....These numbers sound a bit low. Try $9000 total premium per year $8000 deductible plus co-pays and co-insurance. This was what I was paying through the state exchange the last year I bought my insurance under AMA.It's because people who have employer-sponsored healthcare pay much less:  according to one study [in 2019 the average amount covered employees contributed was $1242 for single coverage and $6015 for family coverage](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/average-cost-of-employer-sponsored-health-insurance).  And most people get insurance through their employer.The $1000 tax increase sounds pretty low.  84 bucks a month or thereabouts. Is that supposed to cover the cost of treatment for every person in the US at the same quality and availability?They aren't conservatives because they can do math.How did you arrive at the $1000 tax increase?Really if you look at Medicare for all it's a $34k/yr income minimum so it would be about $1300/yr but that's still cheaper an any private health insurer.[deleted]1000$ a year?  Lmao yall just keep wanting to give and give and give to the government.  \s\sHow bout we re-appropropriate shit like FOREIGN AID and forever retirements and benefits for 2 years of ""work"".  Why don't we start trimming the fat.  \sBecause 1000k a year from everyone is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  I would assume it was a year because there's more than 65-70% of the US population that not in their wildest dreams could they afford 1k a month for SOMEONE ELSES SHIT.No lol universal healthcare is cheaper and more efficient for everyone so if you want to trim fat you should support Medicare for All.If you think Foreign Aid is a meaningful part of our budget then you have been fucking brainwashed by right-wing propaganda (no seriously; the ""foreign aid is a huge part of our budget"" thing is a myth intentionally started by Republicans decades ago).\s\sSo either you're repeating their propaganda unaware it's lies or you are yourself lying.\s\sIf the former please educate yourself before you spread more misinformation.\s\sIf the latter fuck yourself with a rake.Based. I agree. Let's stop spending our money on stupid crap too.\s\sLet's not forget the government is inefficient at anything it does and bureaucrats should not have a say in people's medical decisions that's between them and their doctors.\s\sIt would also open the door for yet more government corruption because god knows our country needs more of that....What turns me off is having our useless government in full control of our health.What turns me off is for-profit ~~anything~~ ""healthcare"" and for-profit ""education"". Having to pay to fucking exist and it's too expensive to grind for diplomas^(1) in order to pay to fucking exist.\s\sdiplomas^(1): Which are given out by for-profit businesses who couldn't care less who actually deserves to have what's seen as a success in higher education and ""intelligence"". Nobody gives a fucking shit if someone's intelligent because if some greedy ass business says you aren't than you can't be.Instead it's a for profit group whose goal has nothng to do with your health.You are both not wrong and wrong here.  Our government is currently corrupt and doing Everything they can to stop single payer.  They WILL try to defund it and bribe corporate news to say how terrible it is.  Want an example of this?  Look at the tories going after the NHS in the UK.\s\sThe issue is the alternative is a private corporation owning it and then you just have what we have now which isn't workable for the vast majority of the population.\s\sIf we were to replace our corruption in Our government with regular working class people it wouldn't feel so bad.Damn don't like governments controlling your body?Uh Medicare has premiums and deductibles.\s\shttps://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/medicare-costs-at-a-glanceThis is why I prefer to call it ""Improved Medicare for All"". The purpose isn't just to move everyone onto medicare but to fix the flaws inherent in the Medicare program (such as the 80/20 split goes away).> Uh Medicare has premiums and deductibles.\s\sIt was an eye opener for me a couple years ago when an elderly couple from Washington State killed themselves because they could not afford the medical costs...and they were on medicare.Medicare for all is not the solution. But I’d take it over the bullshit we have now.taxes would go up more than 1k by a lot and people like me who only go to the docs like 2 or 3 times at most a year only pay like maybe $600 at most too.If you would research how much a single payer system would be (it would be cheaper as payment is more guaranteed so a deal can be worked out)\sYou wouldn't have that opinion. You can't really plan on having a emergency be it a heart attack etc so saying you only go 2 or 3 times a year is also stupid. \s\sAnd before you say ""people are literally dying on wait lists in canada"" that's just not true nobody who is in critical condition has to wait if you go to the er with a broken arm though you may have to wait longer than usual because chances are someone is actually in danger of dying if they aren't treated whereas you're just uncomfortably waitingLike the other person said where M4A really shines is unexpected emergencies. You shouldn't be forced into bankruptcy because you have an accident and end up in the hospital for a week. Unless you've got a really nice job with some killer insurance you're probably going to end up with a huge bill even after insurance.With single payer drugs can't be price gouged. The idea isn't that pharmaceutical companies can still charge hundreds of dollars for a 30 day supply of medication and the US just goes and pays them whatever they ask for. As the single payer they get to negotiate drug and treatment costs and they're dramatically reduced. \s\sIf you're uninsured that's fine. But you really can't just expect to never have a medical emergency. Back when I was younger and relatively healthy I wasn't too worried about getting sick...then I get into a car accident and suddenly have tens of thousands of dollars in bills.Why’d you completely steal the top post of the month lmao https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/p8abeq/not_too_hard_to_understand/Um.

But yes they should also be included in m4a because the costs of them would also go down and there'd be a lot less rural folks with missing teeth and half blind from blurry vision.The problem is when your taxes go up and then you also can't get those benefits either due to what income level you are considered  but yet still can't afford it and now your taxes are higher so you can't afford even more now.That's not how Medicare works. There aren't any income qualification levels with Medicare.  It's simply age determined and nothing else afaik.See that's why its called Medicare \_for all\_. Doesn't matter if you're living in a cabin in the woods completely disconnected from society or a fucking billionaire or anywhere in between. You deserve basic healthcare at no cost to you.The question will be how do we fund the hundreds of thousands of people who work for the predatory healthcare industry who will lose their jobs due to Medicare for All.We are already funding them now...Money to kill good.\s\sMoney to live bad.That’s what they charge the military so it actually costs around $890.

That is bullshit. Exxon can pay for its own protection.\s\sSecondly taxpayers are paying the billionaire class that causes climate change to continue causing climate change. Taxpayers have also been indirectly funding the anti-climate action campaign of Big Oil.\s\sPeople need to demand an end to this insanity.Right now they're thinking... looks like we just found one more problem that another $80000 could solve. ;-)The top 1% of our earners pay over 40% of federal taxes. So how are taxpayers paying the billionaire class? The general population pay less than 30% of all federal taxes.The Javelin brought to you by Raytheon.I might be wrong but wasn’t it developed under Texas Instruments? My grandpa was one of the engineers behind javelin and that’s who he worked for. I was always confused why the people who made my calculator was also making missiles.Something something we have to em over there so we dont have to fight em over here.All I said was defend foreign interference.\s\sNow I'm an antisemite because I don't want to fund isreal's iron dome.\s\sA weapon of war is a weapon of war.If visa is not issued to them they won't be able to come. 9/11 guys were in USA officially learned how to fly officially and both CIA and FBI failed to stop them. But why? You know why.American capitalism isn't about making sense. It's about permanently defending and expanding profits and power at the expense of logic humanity and our collective futures.

The issue here is one of how we do the business of war moreso than the fact that we own the kit if we didn't have cost + contracts we'd be much better off we wouldn't get scalped on equipment essential for national solvency.I feel like this comparison leaves out a few important people.  1 $80000 Javelin round is:\s\s* Designed by a guy that makes 2x the cost\s* Built by a guy that makes 0.5x the cost\s* sold by a guy that makes 10x the cost\s* purchased by a guy who makes 5x the cost\s* fired by a guy who makes 0.5x the cost\s* fired at a guy who makes .007x the cost\s\sI just pulled all of those number out of thin air but I suspect they aren't that far off.\s\sEdit: changed built to designed and added more accurate estimate of build labor costs...Eh I'm pretty sure they're built by a guy that makes .5x the cost like the guy firing it. I think you're thinking about the engineers that designed it.First I make one component of that system and I make 1x the cost......\s\sSecondly they would not use a javelin on 1 individual. It's an anti vehicle weapon mostly tanks.ObligatoryMeetTheHeavyJoke.pngAmerica!!

I get that it’s a BHA but it’s still not exactly the same as income even if room and board is an unavoidable expense.Just saying they do probably make that in a year. Most of the military gets free room and board in very expensive areas of the country/world… accounting for that a lot of these guys actually make more than 80k a year.

We don’t pay attention to things like real world facts here we just hate the military ;)intelligence is not completely lostDo socialist countries have armies? If so what is the ratio between what they pay for missiles and pay their soldiers?This post is more lamenting the fact that the missile is fired in the first place. It doesn't matter how much a missile costs if they're rarely used. However that's not the case. Everything about the military industrial complex encourages conflict whereas the opposite should be true under a logical system.TBF I'm pretty sure he'd rather have superior weapons that keep him alive than get paid more before his inferior weapons get him killed.Almost like if we weren't putting his life in danger in the first place we wouldn't have to pay for it\s\sFunny that!I don't even wanna know how much that camera must've cost!

Not to mention will eradicate unemployment.You forgot the /s[deleted]If you seriously think this post is just people complaining about the fact that they don't make the kind of money it requires to fire one javelin missile you have a seriously flawed and myopic worldview[You know you shouldn't do that in this sub](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-wrong-twice-claim-about-defense-bud/)If only 7 billion people would realize only 2300 people are holding the entire globe hostage.Instead powerful people are reimagining how to fuck us over some more with ""Build Back Better""/""The Great Reset""Does anyone wonder why the world worships paper? Money has no inherent value in this world. It only has the power that the people who believe in it give it. Money is the illusion of power. An illusion that 99% of the world believes is real. The accumulation of wealth has never been about the money (You can live a very comfortable life with very little money). It’s all about having power over others. A very ego driven lust for power. If 70% of the world woke up tomorrow and decided that money means nothing to them the world economies would collapse all power would cease to exist and the world would be a very different place. A place where mass groups of people don’t have to suffer at the hands of a few greedy people. Yes we would very much lose much of the luxuries and comfortability we have in this modern world but it would very much work itself out in time and we’d all be freer and happier than we are now in this prison of a system designed to benefit a slim few’s ridiculous and narcissistic views of what a good life is. Those are ideas that will get you assassinated if you try and bring them to the public’s attention. This is very much the matrix and the reason  why Economic equality will never exist within the system. It’s the first step in ripping down the entire systemI don't think it's too late to organize for those changes.

Hearst was a well-known US newspaper proprietor known as the ‘father’ of the so-called ‘yellow press’ i.e. the sensationalist press.  William Hearst began his career as a newspaper editor in 1885 when his father George Hearst a millionaire mining industrialist Senator and newspaper proprietor himself put him in charge of the San Francisco Daily Examiner.\s\sThis was also the start of the Hearst newspaper empire an empire which strongly influenced the lives and thinking of North Americans.  After his father died William Hearst sold all the mining industry shares he inherited and began to invest capital in the world of journalism.  His first purchase was the New York Morning Journal a traditional newspaper which Hearst completely transformed into a sensationalist rag.  He bought his stories at any price and when there were no atrocities or crimes to report it behoved his journalists and photographers to ‘arrange’ matters.  It is this which in fact characterises the ‘yellow press’: lies and ‘arranged’ atrocities served up as truth.\s\sThese lies of Hearst’s made him a millionaire and a very important personage in the newspaper world.  In 1935 he was one of the richest men in the world with a fortune estimated at $200 million.  After his purchase of the Morning Journal Hearst went on to buy and establish daily and weekly newspapers throughout the US.  In the 1940s William Hearst owned 25 daily newspapers 24 weekly newspapers 12 radio stations 2 world news services one business providing news items for films the Cosmopolitan film company and a lot of others.  In 1948 he bought one of the US’s first TV stations BWAL – TV in Baltimore.  Hearst’s newspapers sold 13 million copies a day and had close to 40 million readers.  Almost a third of the adult population of the US were reading Hearst newspapers every day.  Furthermore many millions of people throughout the world received information from the Hearst press via his news services films and a series of newspapers that were translated and published in large quantities all over the world.  The figures quoted above demonstrate how the Hearst empire was able to influence American politics and indeed world politics over very many years – on issues which included opposition to the US entering the Second World War on the side of the Soviet Union and support for the McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts of the 1950s.\s\s William Hearst’s outlook was ultra-conservative nationalist and anti-communist.  His politics were the politics of the extreme right.  In 1934 he travelled to Germany where he was received by Hitler as a guest and friend.  After this trip Hearst’s newspapers became even more reactionary always carrying articles against socialism against the Soviet Union and especially against Stalin.  Hearst also tried to use his newspapers for overt Nazi propaganda purposes publishing a series of articles by Goering Hitler’s right-hand man.  The protests of many readers however forced him to stop publishing such items and to withdraw them from circulation.\s\s After his visit to Hitler Hearst’s sensationalist newspapers were filled with ‘revelations’ about the terrible happenings in the Soviet Union – murders genocide slavery luxury for the rulers and starvation for the people all these were the big news items almost every day.  The material was provided to Hearst by the Gestapo Nazi Germany’s political police.  On the front pages of the newspapers there often appeared caricatures and falsified pictures of the Soviet Union with Stalin portrayed as a murderer holding a dagger in his hand.  We should not forget that these articles were read each day by 40 million people in the US and millions of others worldwide!\s\s---\s\sfrom [Lies concerning the history of the Soviet Union: From Hitler to Hearst from Conquest to Solzhenitsyn](http://www.mariosousa.se/LiesconcerningthehistoryoftheSovietUnion.html)Such as?We call them ""Socialist by name only"" people.That problem is inherent in the nature of communist revolution itself. The material conditions that are necessary to bring about the revolution also preclude the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.Confirmed serial rapist Joe Biden is scared of socialism.

Them nasty commies after centuries of Tsar barbarities awoke to devastation and America attacking it.\s\sGO FIGGER...Y’know you can agree with their civil rights ideas while disagreeing with the communist part right?Ya know it seems wildly suspicious when the school system leaves out a very specific and important detail to the story of civil rightsWhen literally every single civil rights activist is involved in socialist organising I'm pretty sure you're at the point where they're intrinsically linked.noNòn[deleted]No they're saying that every civil rights activist was ALSO a socialist.During the Cold War supporters of the Soviet Union offered support or targeted disenfranchised groups in the US to increase domestic social unrest.   Soviet propagandist and ideologues often saw African Americans as natural allies against the West.  So its not surprising that many activists from the Cold War era would have some linkage or affiliation with Communist or Socialist movements.  Very similar to the way the Chinese Communist Party targets disenfranchised or marginalized groups in the US today.love this fucking framing as though it were the soviet union's fault for bringing attention to the lynching of black people not their atrocious treatment by the USA. get out of here with this anticommunist garbage.These are two interesting thoughts to juggle.\s\s(1) we should help those less fortunate\s(2) countries can do this to sow discord as an ulterior motiveHmm maybe they were the good guys[Maybe if they weren't systematically marginalized and abused....](https://youtu.be/wZqR2KEd_hk)Yeah fuck those commies for “targeting” black people to help them organize and demand rightsThis sounds awfully similar to a fascist conspiracy theory.black people don’t have the mental fortitude to organize and support their communities so it must have been those damn communists who won over their minds /s\s\soh snap I realized as I wrote that sarcastic comment that it kind of describes trump supporters and their representatives.Could it be that the school system doesn't want to demonize civil rights figures? Communism is a pretty shit thing to believe in these days imo\s\sEdit: If the communists are down voting you you're doing something right lolWait until you learn about capitalism you are going to be shocked!Why is it a shitty thing to believe in?Eh it's no worse on paper than any other system. \s\sThe problem that every system has is when people gain and retain power over others.That is 100% face palming bologna.how? why?[removed]Lmao people will know MLK Jr.’s name for hundreds of years. You’ll be forgotten within a generationplease jump into the path of a trainIf activist preached capitalism and the idea you get what you work for the sheep would never follow them. The idea of taking from those that were intelligent enough to succeed and willing to work for wealth sounds much better to those that have never figured out how to succeed and gain wealth.> you get what you work for\s\sSo you understand when we say Workers should recieve more of the capital produced by their labor.Scrolling through your comments history... you must really think you’re out here doing God’s work...You do not under capitalism by any stretch of he imagination ""get what you work for"" you absolute joke.You people will always praise and support the boot that tramples on your face and others because you hope one day you will own the boot.The khmer rouge are the only real socialists.Why do you say that young man (I'm guessing) what about Khmer Rouge makes them the only real socialists?Because I believe no one is wanting to kill for it we saw the overall deal with that a lot of people do not like to be violent they are pacifists killing isn't something they want to do and nobody wants to die by losing their only lifeline of making money to survive. \s\sSomething has to give.

I'm not just talking about the ""1%""... But also the top 10-20%... Liberal and conservative elites who just sit at home and click to make an Amazon worker run around like a mouse in a maze in some sick excitement... to send them some frivolous non essential products.I disagree  the top 10% of the people make $100000 or more  if you see it statistically they are still employees or small businessmen  not super rich people.\s\sAnd as someone who is in the top 2% and makes $380000 a year ( this varies per year  not fixed )  I can tell you that I have no power over system and I get fucked by billionaires and $100-millionaires every day. The system favours the top 4% ( statistically ) and yes they have gotten a lot more richer ( like me ).\s\sBut the ones who have significant power over the country are only the 0.1%What are you doing about it besides complaining online? You can keep saying what's wrong and how bad it is but if you're just going to sit there and do nothing about it then you're just a hypocrite.\s\sI'm saying that with the best intentions. People need to stop acting like they're spectators. Live by your ethics organize build and strategize. The People's Party is a good initiative but you need to look at a more concrete and personal level. You can't change a system if you can't even change yourself.>	What are you doing about it besides complaining online?\s\sThis sub does nothing but complain and when I’ve pointed it out in the past I’ve been told “this place isn’t for activism.” WOTB exists for one purpose only — to leave you feeling dejected hopeless and depressed enough to stop voting.\s\s Several months ago one of the mods admitted to suffering from depression; I was canceled by WOTB because I pressured the community to DO SOMETHING about the problem. They kept saying “we can’t afford health insurance” but I was providing them links to FREE TALK THERAPY and offering to go with the mods who suffer from this. No one was interested. \s\sI’ve reached out to some here complaining about their low wage job that I would be willing to help them jumpstart a career in sustainable construction. I have risen from an untrained draftsman to an architect over the last 8 years and would be happy to point anyone to the right resources. None are interested. It goes back to the toxic culture on this subreddit that celebrates not taking care of oneself. \s\sAfter 5 years of this I know it will never change here because progressing is difficult especially in the area of mental health. At a certain point the best thing you can do is try to warn others. Sometimes the truth hurts.\s\sI like turtles.Fuck Manning! That little shit is a goddamned traitor and a fraud. Several of my family members got their identity’s stolen because of this bitch. Use literally anyone else but Manning.""Exposing war crimes is treason! Our boys were just doing their job by blowing up that ambulance!""Well no one wants to get shot. Or Manninged. That’s why.Perhaps we're looking at this the wrong way.  Maybe the system was never designed to support people during period of crisis -- we were just lied to and told that it was.\s\sIf the system hasn't changed in 200+ years maybe it's not broken -- maybe we're just not looking at it the way it was meant to be.\s\sDon't forget Social Services that we are grateful for like Food Stamps/SNAP Social Security & Medicare aren't even 100 years old.  (Social Security wasn't enacted until 1935 Food Stamps weren't enacted until 1939 and Medicare wasn't a thing until 1965.)I think you're right the system was never meant to help us or be for us in any way.  As Chomsky said: the primary role of government is to protect property from the majority.\s\sOf course he still said ""vote Biden"" because the orange boot is scarier.The System was designed for a benefit of a relatively small group of white property owners. It is people pushing back against this system that has made it better over time. We have backslid in a lot of ways over the past 40 years. If enough people can be engaged positive changes can be made once again.Thats exactly her point. We pay trillions into a system and we were lied to that it was a system for the people when its not.\s\sIts a system of siphoning assets to banks and military manufacturers in blowing up foreign lands.Dual power time?No matter how fucked up the system is\s\s\sPeople only get angry enough and dedicated enough to change it when they their bellies are empty.\s\sRussian Revolution\sFrench Revolution\sSee any revolution when the system was changed.\s\sAnd in our system only 12% of the people are food insecure ( not malnourished ). So no one wants to overthrow the government and change the whole system or at least they don't feel the extreme urgency to do so. That's why we have a lot less revolutions in this century than other centuriesAnd due to a lack of suitable/expanded social safety net and a myriad of other things enabling  Americans to be struggling one paycheck to another they are hardly in the position to strike or riot as the French. And even if they did I bet you MSM would label them as violent if they even covered it and or the FBI and law enforcement would work to crush the movement just as they did with Occupy (and even BLM) under Obama.""Have you seen the other guy? - Vote Kudos!""To make money for the richest at the topI wish people would specify when they talk about ""the system"".\sIt's about as vague as complaining about ""the man"".\sI'm left to guess what ""system"" is being referred to.\s\sIf I had to guess it sounds like it's the economic system specifically that has failed us.\sThat's the system that manages the production and distribution of goods and services to the people that need them.\sAnd that economic system that has failed us has a name.\s\sIt's called ""capitalism"".Also what’s meant by we.  That’s a big one that does a lot of work for a lot of people.\s\sAt his best Chomsky once said people mistake end goals for a plan to get there.  You ask them how to deal with wealth inequality and they say “general strike”.  \s\sThere isn’t a ‘we’ yet at least not in any actionable sense.  Posting and reading relatable posts gives the impression there is but there isn’t.It exists to rule disguised as a choice like a casino. Yes there are a few winners to keep the lie going but it’s the house that owns everyone who comes through the door. The masters don’t want to be bowed down to. Force begets uprising. Through the invention of money and the manipulations of it one can own you through deception instead of the whip. This is neofeudalism.Because it still functions enough to be able to kill a whole goddamn lot of us if we were to do shit about it.Probably the single most undeniably heroic daring courageous and principled member of the trans community alive today yet that community (as a whole) does not even know who Chelsea Manning is. \s\s.\s\sWeird isn’t it?No they know rupaul or other trans celeb.

I'm the weekly free drop.capitalism isnt supposed to take care of the poor etc. it is designed to benefit the bourgeoisie and thats exactly what it's doing. the only reason the welfare state exists is to pacify the masses enough to hold back desire for a change (socialism).Because revolution is very difficult and uncomfortable and reform makes some problems better but others worse.Yep.\sBut poverty misery and economic injustice is also very difficult and uncomfortable.\sWhen material conditions get uncomfortable enough revolutions (or at least attempts at revolutions) can happen.Americans aren't looking for a Revolution. -Joe Biden\s\sAs out of touch as Hillary and Pelosi are.

For years I've listened and read an awful lot but have yet to see proposals that have even a glimmer of a chance of producing positive results.  \s\sFor now I'll be supporting the People's Party.

You might also consider joining their [Socialist Equality Party](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/pages/sep/us/home.html) which is part of an international network of parties working to independently organize and mobilize the working class against the bourgeoisie.America is probably the most soma drugged society which explains the lethargy. But it only takes about 20% to create critical mass which then creates an avalanche and if you get lucky like the Russians did you topple the Romanovs (read DemRep oligarch duopolist dictatorship). When the avalanche begins direction not force will be the problem.\s\sIf however on the other hand there is a burgeoning America to attack America even whilst the revolution like America did Russia it will probably fail. And regardless of how well you pick up the pieces like the Bolsheviks did a greed that is halfway to fruition and was your former ally might spend the equivalent of eight trillion that U$ et al spent. I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that a racist at its core like America ""built on"" faux religiosity and genuine genocide will lead that charge.\s\sLook at Netanyahu and tell me that slab of rancid pork doesn't want to control and torture humanity. At its core zionazi is as evil as the original nazi.It takes much less than 20%. \s\sSignificantly less. \s\s3.5% of the population is all that's needed to enact revolutionary change.\s\sGive this a listen. https://youtu.be/YJSehRlU34wThe tweet makes no sense.  If you think there are other countries that you'd rather live in you can move to your preferred country.There isn't another livable planet. If we want a **good** one we have to make it so ourselves.Moving costs money and the process of leaving is made as difficult as humanly possible by bureaucrats who understand that America needs a passive population of wage slaves. Will you be contributing to GoFundMes to help people leave this shithole country?Oh yeah.  Up and relocating to another country is easy as pie.  Nevermind the fact that other countries also have their own rules regarding immigration and work 🙄Or we could protest and agitate for political change *here*Human complacency and the need to have power over others.\s\sMost of us are complacent. Those that aren’t are either power hungry or too few to enact real change for the better. \s\sWe just need people to not be complacent because the majority of us would not be driven to have power over other people.Apathy and tragedy of the commons. People are distracted and brainwashed into embracing tribalism and shunning those who reach out for class solidarity. They are also not liable to protest (or form a union even) as they are afraid of losing their job/what little they *do* have.Well duh. We have to support Raytheon in building bombs and planes to kill brown children 4000 miles away. If we have money left over than it will go to banks or pharma companies for any losses then we can consider helping the people that paid into that pot. consider.>Why do we allow this system to continue to exist?\s\sBecause the overwhelming majority of us are to chickenshit to sacrifice everything for what we believe in.  We want our comfort and conveniences and stable lives.  Power is taken not asked for but obtaining real power takes real risk.  I might be projecting but it seems the overwhelming majority of us are content to be cowards.It's time to break down this useless system and create a New one from scratch.Hurry up and ""invade"" the capitol already.\s\s/sI think folks are pussyfooting around an ugly realization but violence and the the threat of violence locks this current system in. America has made greed money and violence its true religion. At a grassroots level politicians use the threat of hyper-violent police to create compliance. So what happens when the people no longer are affected or give a damn about the threat of police? This is why there is no police reform and why they come down hard on the populace and especially the disenfranchised African Americans. Because the African American first and foremost has proven himself to 1. create movements (a ""Black messiah"") that challenge that status quo and 2. no one (apart from indigenous americans) has more reason to see the status quo change.   \s\s\sI dunno if its too late...  society is like the alcoholic who can't go cold turkey or he will die. We are sick and the sickness is sanctioned by the state the madness is as much a part of the american ideology as the time tested cliches of love. It is what America does... the greed the violence the hypocrisy. We tell ourselves there are only a few bad apples amongst cops but then you realize the entire concept of policing (as it exists) is bad and the good cops are the few.   \s\s\sI'd like to see things change in my litetime but I'm not holding my breath.Loses some cred because of his stupid faux progressive bootlicker hat.Ad hominem fallacy. Stupid people can and do occasionally make good points.Yes that is the sentiment beaten into us from a young age by a paid-off propagandized media and school system (*you don't want to grow up to be a trash man do you?*).\s\sTurns out trash men have it pretty good and regardless deserves the same treatment and respect as any 'educated' profession.Mostly it's actually anti government sentiment that power corrupts absolutely. That things like UBI enslave people and make them rely on a government who essentially wants to enslave them. It's a compelling theory tbh. Also there's the anti communist propaganda which is stupid in my opinion.Who cares if most people are more or less unspectacular normies without remarkable aspirations or talents? What does it matter? We shouldn't rank people's access to a good quality of life based on their potential to be a savant or whatever.The Democratic Party is now the party of Meritocracy you are either rich highly educated or have an extraordinary talent or expertise in order to have value. Or you can be a token working class minority who is used to virtue signal an elite's wokeness. But as soon as they are done with you then you're sent back to the meat grinder (our predatory economy).Here's the tweet in case anyone wanted to retweet:\s\s[https://twitter.com/IsicaLynn/status/1328087512133238786](https://twitter.com/IsicaLynn/status/1328087512133238786)Honestly I don’t ever know what people mean when they say socialist. Some people are talking about European style capitalism or the Nordic system other people are full blown tankies. Nobody also ever seems to bother differentiating between socialism and communism regardless of whether they’re a hardcore libertarian or a Stalinist. \s\sI don’t like the socialist label because it’s too loaded with negative connotations. I would like a form of capitalism that that puts heavy restraints and regulations on larger businesses to prevent them from abusing people. Our current system is cancer. \s\sI guess I consider myself a populist or an FDR style Democrat.FDR style Democrat is known as social democrat. But here's the thing: the New Deal was FDR's bid as he put it to ""save capitalism."" \s\sSprinkling crumbs on the peasants isn't enough. Socialism means collective democratic ownership of production.People are lazy. They are lazy at forming their own opinions. Americans in general are in the dumb side of things ready to give their individual minds over to someone who presumably agrees with their short sighted beliefs and who they learn to trust to think for them.I always try and remind people who say the first part that that's their perspective of humans *coming from* a capitalist society. They're like that because of the world we live in. Humans aren't naturally lazy or miserable or dumb or whatever if you see them as that think about what kind of society those humans live in and compare them to humans who lived peacefully and sustainably in indigenous tribes. Were they selfish and lazy?Absolutely. Otherwise why would we have had to SpReAd DeMoCrAcY?It’s both there are lazy people and there are people that would do great things without being in dire straits.  Neither beliefs are wrong. I think that what everyone can agree on is that bad luck seems to fall on people in the lower class exponentially and we would like to create a system where the bad luck is more evenly dispersed not all pilling up on one group. \s\sThe general concept people who are anti socialist have about it is that it’s a system that wants to tear down the top and target people who have been successful. I doubt that most anti socialist people would be opposed to a system that works to create more successful people on every level. Perspective and language plays a big role in the persuasion.\s\sThe phrase eat the rich equates to many as being anti success. It’s hostile language that sounds like a system of pure revenge. And why would anyone want to support that?? If you want to gain allies in creating a better world you have to start with maturity and respect for other peoples perspectives and experience. Then discovering where you differ on a subject is half the battle won. Avoid blaming and emotional revenge talk to start. All people rich and poor have great value. Romanticism of either group leads to a failure of awareness of the other. You won’t build a better world by political violence or emotional revenge. Intelligence and creativity is how you build a better world.You chalk it up to “bad luck”.  Really? What’s next bad karma or Jesus didn’t want to joke a player up? Nah.  It’s by design.This is really well said. I'm a contrarian cunt by nature so when I went to a super left-leaning college I tried to find arguments to counter my friends' socialist beliefs. It took me arguing some of these points aloud for me to realize how idiotic the idea is that privation is somehow necessary for the economy to function. Even older conservative thinkers like Dostoyevsky revert to this point that ""man does not live by bread alone"" in order to argue against redistributing wealth. The argument basically boils down to: even when the poor do have those basic necessities like food and shelter they will still be unsatisfied/without purpose. This is such an irrelevant argument. The point of regulating wages/welfare is not to give the lower class a sense of purpose/satisfaction or somehow aid them with spiritual development it's to give them enough to stay alive.You don't have to go socialist--government and/or workers owning the means of production--  to ensure that a population is not perpetually in dire straits.  Scandinavian nations are capitalist but with more (and better) public programs than the US.[deleted]Work is also voluntary in the US.  No prison needed.Why would you choose to work in prison?Even if this was a real thing and not just some uncited claim on the internet I don't believe it's out of ""laziness"". Prison is mind-shatteringly boring. Literal staring at the same 4 walls for years. The only reason I can think of turning down optional work would be out of conscientious objection.Its interesting that people are trying to find rational reasons for what is essentially the result of [decades of propaganda](https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/fifties/essays/anti-communism-1950s) directed at the [American public](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/22/anti-communist-laws-california-trump-russia).We do not need your studies. We can see every day what people on welfare are like.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThere is several generations of urban poor that have virtually every expense covered from healthcare to rent. Zero real pressure to secure funds. For 10s of millions of mostly urban poor there has been UBI for decades.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sWhat have they done with it? Reached excellence? Hardly. It has destroyed their once proud culture and delivered them whole into the antagonistic hands of globalist warmongers.I agreeIf it was true that people need the threat of poverty to keep them working everyone with a million plus dollars would immediately retireSuccess is addictive. Being successful is itself an art. And people who are a little good at it tend to get better and better exponentially. The same goes the other way. If you have very little you can become very good at it. Psychologically speaking happiness isn’t exactly linked to wealth either. Which seems counterintuitive but nonetheless is still true.Exactly!None of the what's in the tweet are pro's or con's of socialism though.  The tweet is about welfare.I think it's less about suffering and more about motivation.  How do you propose we motivate people to succeed under socialism.People don't need to ""be motivated"". Humans are naturally driven to improve their lives the state of their community and to leave a legacy for future generations.\s\sWealth allows you to do that but only if you have a sufficiently large excess of wealth to invest in things beyond basic sustenance. And that's the rub: the average american lives paycheck to paycheck. They toil all day long to afford shelter food basic healthcare and little more.\s\sPeople today are honestly not that different from feudal serfs who farmed their land to put food on their table while all of the excess went to their lord. Where's the motivation in that? Why should anyone work harder than necessary if they receive no benfit from that extra work.\s\sIf you empower people with financial security they not only perform their work more efficiently (due to lower stress) but they will tend to use a greater portion of their free time investing in their work their family and their community.\s\sI know this from personal experience. For years I struggled to make ends meet. Lost my job at the beginning of the pandemic and landed a much better job six months later. I make about 50% more than I did pre-pandemic. I find myself using my spare income and time to finally repair all the broken shit in my home pay off debt invest in my art/several community projects and working overtime to deliver the best possible product. And I feel great doing all this. When I'm at my desk I'm concentrating on my work rather than stressing out about how I'm going to pay rent next month. I can buy a sandwich at the deli without having to try 3 credit cards before finding one that's not maxed out.A better life for everyone is pretty great motivationdo you think people inherently want to fail and starve in a ditch or something without some kind of external motivation?I disagree with the idea that payment is the only possible way to motivate people to work but you do realize that you can still have a work system based on paying people under socialism right?Simply the fact that people can work to benefit their community as opposed to lining pockets of their paymasters. It is how we prospered as a species from our tribal days onwards.Automation will create joblessness and poverty under capitalism.\s\sUnder socialism it will bless many people with a lot of free time.\s\sThat's the beauty of socialism you don't need to be motivated to succeed you can succeed by just not hurting others. I'm sure there's people that would love to do whatever tasks cannot be fully automated. If you search long enough you're going to find someone that's like ""Oh my god that's awesome I wanna do that!""\s\sAre there going to be people just not doing anything? Yes. But to that I say look at nature and see what animals do in their downtime. Nothing. Except for dolphins. Dolphins get high on puffer fish-poison and have sex for fun.Autonomy mastery purpose.

I think people would be surprised by how many politicians actually support some kind of socialism.Not really.  A lot of anti-socialist sentiment stems from the tremendous concentration of power necessary to achieve a truly socialist state that would be incompatible with liberal democracies.  Socialist ideals requires government officials to be dispassionate economic technocrats who don't react to the preferences of their constituent bases in managing the economy - that's never going happen.  All you'd get under Socialism is a long road toward increasing autocratic governance to control competing constituent groups.  \s\sCapitalist systems should have well-managed social welfare systems such as those that exist in the Nordic states.  But resorting to socialism would not remedy the challenges inherent in capitalism and would make many challenges worse..> from the tremendous concentration of power necessary to achieve a truly socialist state\s\sAnd who's arguing for that? People are arguing for policies and programs like M4A that benefit everyone instead of just the few and that gets dismissed as scary socialism.have you ever heard of a worker's council??I've definitely experienced this myself. When you're working 8+ hours per day there is little time or desire to do anything other than relax when you get home. \s\sWhen that time is freed up you can spend it on educating yourself and all sorts of creative and useful projects.Lazy is a medical diagnosis \s/sI would love to walk in nature for hours and deliberately collect garbage plant trees and help restore nature areas.

As of right now I can sort of try to do some of these things half assed or not at all because of time/money/resources.Ironically this how people lived before the Industrial Revolution. The business model of overproduction and overconsumption is killing us as people and killing the planet.Wow. Most of the people I know (and work with) do amazing things every day and work hard because it's a part of their DNA. They're not rich nor oppressed nor poor nor in dire straits.I literally don’t understand that. Do they think you will not get paid in socialism? Do workers not engineer and make everything in capitalism as well? What’s the problemIn socialism you are not rewarded for working harder or being smarter. You make what everyone else makes.Maybe they have never seen all the volunteers that keep things running smoothly.

If the people are happy healthy and strong the country would benefit in the long run.Read about Positive Psychology M. Seligman. Nothing to do with socialism everything to do with people being more creative and healthier and happier when they are not suffering. I mean this shit should be common sense by now c’mon.Why is the argument always one or the other capitalist or socialist as if a nation is only allowed to have one single system? \s\sI mean America already employs certain aspects of socialism in areas while also being labeled as an exclusively capitalist country but I figured most people were aware that we aren’t actually a purely capitalistic nation. \s\sWhenever I see debate about this topic it’s almost always an all or nothing argument from both sides which is never beneficial in any way and serves as a distraction from the actual issues. \s\sUnfortunately this basic ass two-sided construct is how most issues are discussed in America which is probably why so much shit is fucked up but for some reason I thought economic discussion could at least be a bit more in depth.I don't think it's that simple. This interpretation strike me as facile.\s\sThe deeper reason for conservatives distrusting socialism has little to do with a belief that people are fundamentally given to sloth and will do nothing if provided for. Though there might be a bit of that negative perception of human nature.\s\sthe primary reason they distrust socialism is that it is almost by definition centrally administered and it is that central government role that they have issues with. They'll tell you that any large federal program requires a large bureaucracy which they view as 'wasteful"" and ""inefficient' at best. Incompetent at worst.\s\sThey have a point if one looks at say Soviet Russia but the point disappears when one looks at Germany or Denmark which are Social democracies. Also France. The reason being is that those countries have fostered over decades and decades a tradition of civil servants who are educated dedicated well trained well paid and respected. There is status for the public servant in Europe - I have seen that in person.\s\sNow this isn't always true (there is Italy which is a basket case and the UK - another basket case of administration that's both inefficient and insufficiently responsive). \s\sStill even in the US there are well-managed programs one can point to. Specifically medicare Social Security and the Military. By contrast the MICs - private entities that they are are notoriously wasteful and inefficient - always coming in over budget and late. When I use this line of argument - pointing to the good federal centrally administered programs - and some of the bad - private large companies that are too hierarchical unfair and inefficient I usually score some points.\s\sUnfortunately the line about ""original sin of laziness' and their supposed belief in it won't fly too well and may get a serious push-back.\s\sOnly Twitterati see the need to resort to such shallow argumentation alas. Not easy to do deep observations in 100 or so characters.....It’s a shame answers like this will remain in the single-digit upvote doldrums.I’m not sure. Some policies actually reduce beaurocracy\s\sAn easy example is Medicare for all. Currently roughly 31% of costs in medicine are a result of administrative and beaurocratic fees. Countries which have centralized healthcare have far lessGermany and Denmark are two countries that were homogenous societies with well developed work ethic. Denmark restricted the influx of refugees and deported most that would not integrate into their society and labor market due to the burden on their welfare system. Germany is struggling because they freely allowed refugees and now are facing political and economic backlash. Assuming the US which already spends more on welfare and social programs then any other country could have even more generous social programs does not take into consideration the cost. Burdening the workers and producers with more taxes to give the non-producers better lives and give them even less incentive to become producers is probably not a great idea. Adding more government and bureaucracy to manage it only increases the cost. The policy of Opportunity Zones which gives people a chance to become producers and get off welfare seems to be a better idea. Incentives to keep fathers out of households should be reversed to encourage strong families which will aid in raising children that become producers and responsible member of society. \s\sSocial Security Medicare and the Military are very wasteful and only seem to be run efficiently because of the amount of money spent to manage them allows for the waste. If a private business operated in the same manner they would not survive.I'd just stop working it's not like if I had the means to live without constant stress I would save money up start a business and give back to the economy and its people...\s\sEdit: Guess the joke wasn't interpreted  so adding a /s to thisAnd there's where you're different from a lot of people. When friends who play the lottery talk about winning it's not big houses they want it's a fund to help people in greater financial straits than they are themselves. Some of the most generous people I've ever met were borderline poor themselves some of the least generous have been people who were financially comfortable. Some of the latter did give in other ways like volunteering their time to charitable organizations.this is just such a completely BS argument. not all rich people are hard working not all poor people are lazy. there is simply no correlation between wealth and .. hardworkingness.. I'm sure there's a better word for thatwork ethic or character maybeThat idea that hard work yields success has some merit. If you don’t prepare for winter you will freeze if you don’t hunt or grow food you will starve. But it isn’t isolated there are other markers for success attitude personality and intelligence are right up there too. The idea that nothing but hard work is how to be successful has more to do with Protestant philosophy. Very few people that are successful are successful through passion or luck. It does happen from time to time. But that idea is mostly bs. Passion and luck are not something you can count on. Systems work goals and passion are bullshit.Mark Knopfler disagrees.His solo stuff is good too so he did amazing things in and out of Dire Straits.IMO it's worse than that:  A good number of Americans are just mean.  For example studies have shown that it's less expensive to society to house people than to leave them homeless.  Not only do we prefer to pay more to keep them homeless but we won't even provide basic facilities like a coin-operated shower.>For example studies have shown that it's less expensive to society to house people than to leave them homeless.  \s\sAnd who benefits from this? Anyone that wants people desperate enough to accept shit wages. And so they have 0 problem with ""wasteful"" spending when its to keep the plebs in line.Homelessness is not solved by acting like a 5 year old and saying ""let's house/give houses to the homeless and then they won't be homeless anymore!"" That is how you fail to look at the issue behind homelessness and just exacerbate the system.\s\sThe majority of homeless people are that way due to mental issues. If you just house them they'll destroy the housing or let it fall into disrepair and neglect which people forget because they seem to think houses are magic and eternal without major upkeep.  I'm willing to concede its because our generations aren't  homeowners so we don't think of these things as readily but that doesn't  mean we should ignore it and then have a bunch of homeless people and destroyed property.\s\sMany homeless are on the streets by choice because their issues make them uncomfortable in available housing for the.homeless or they cannot.function in society and the homeless life is easier than the stress of society.\s\sIf you want to fix homelessness you first have to come up with a solution for the mentally ill then that would enable you to focus on the much easier issue of ""down on their luck"" homeless.\s\sI'm saying this as someone that has gone broke and homeless multiple times in life.shes wrong. shes giving the reactionaries too much credit. They have no idea what socialism is or why they hate it. if you ask them what socialism is they say whatever the prevailing narrative is at the time lately its Joe Biden back when the pandemic was going beginning it was China. The anti-socialists have no idea what it is or why they hate them they just need to take their rage out on somebody and that is a convenient enemy.Don't forget about VenezuelaWhy this is very true. I mean I’m from China so I feel like I understand the danger of communism. Most Americans actually have no idea what they should fear about communism or that most of the fear that they have is already happening in America but it’s just done by corporation.They also seem to love our police and military which are both socialist institutions. We don't have private corporations doing police work or forming a navy. \s\sIt's sort of like how a lot of Dems define Facists as anyone they disagree with politically. The right just defines socialists as anyone they disagree with lolI am the first kind of person and I'm sorry for ruining it everybody.Well you are wrong.I mean not everyone but I'm telling you if I don't have to do something to get something I will definitely not do it. I'm just lazy as fuck I honestly could (maybe also did) play videogames all day long every day which is why I have my doubts.Which does not mean that I think that capitalism doesn't sucks assYes this is exactly what I always hear from people skeptical of socialism. They always claim human nature is lazy and selfish.Those ppl are the lazy ones projecting their faults onto othersYeah they need to join a different bandI know I would.We seriously need to stop looking at the poor people when we talk about these issues. \s\sLook at the rich muthafuckers. YES their are some shitheads who don’t work and live off of their trust funds. But their are a bunch that go get educated and go do something they love to do. I’m willing to bet all these people who say that the poors won’t work are lazy pos’s themselves and it’s just projection. How many people have dreams that get shattered because of overwhelming adversity and the need to claw and scratch to survive. I’ve known tons of friends who let their dreams of being a photographer or pilot or many other numerous thing go because they couldn’t afford it. The only fucking thing that would happen if you gave everyone a liveable wage would be the VAST MAJORITY THRIVING going to school getting skills. You guys do realize that ALMOST EVERY SINGLE INVENTOR of the past 200 years had a WEALTHY PATRON SUPPORTING THEM. How many of you have dream jobs you would pursue if you had financial security. EXACTLY suck it haters.Capitalism is currently destroying my dream to one day not feel like pulling my insides out violently through my mouth because that sounds more pleasant than looking in the mirror because gender dysphoria is fun. I mean there's an easy fix. (not really quick but easy) but government says no.Why do you think the capitalists fight socialism so very very hard? Because once the cat's out of the bag the cat's out of the bag. Once people figure out how much better life is in a socialist democracy the capitalists are sunk. They HAVE to keep the blinders on the rest of us.There’s a much bigger incentive to work to have actual nice things than to just toil to surviveI've always worked primarily for my leisure time to be able to spend it somewhat comfortably doing a few of the things I enjoyed doing and without having to stress over how the bills will get paid.Talk about your classic straw man argument. Socialism has a world class history of producing maximal suffering so there is a hint of comedy here.   \s\s\sReduced to simple terms Socialism is based on theft on crime against the victim via overwhelming force by the state. It is criminal in the worst of ways. It leads to the ruling class being able to get away with murder and do anything they want.   \s\s\sThe rights of man are based upon NO ONE being able to harm the individual or for the state to commit crimes. Loathing of socialism is obviously the only logically moral stance one could take.First off a Market socialism would still promote hard work not laziness but it would benefit people directly for their hard work no longer would your work enrich someone else you'd be the one profiting from your effort.Yes not being debilitatingly depressed from capitalism does wonders...I was getting ready to leave the same comment!yascame here to just thatUnder Democrats....\s\sNever vote blue.Under both teams.don’t you see common folk? i’m a humble celebrity who hates the rich just like you! now if you’ll excuse me i’m going to go the party on one of Leonardo DiCaprio’s boatsThis. Actual socialism would in fact abolish the capitalist class.They think that somehow a de facto wealth cap (discouraging accumulation above a certain point) would stifle innovation. Why invent anything if you only make X billion dollars? They ignore that the ultra wealthy made comfortable livings off of initial ideas. The billions come in when you corner markets and stifle innovation to extract more money just to watch a ticker track upwards. We would not lose out on any innovation by preventing this last stage. Invent your cool thing make a few million then fuck off till you've another good idea. Even that is a compromise I'm barely comfortable with given that it's often (coughElonMuskcough) just a rich failson paying other people to invent shit for them.Exactly right. Billionaires have a suffocating stranglehold on the economy.In Sweden mask-wearing is **illegal**.\s\s[Sweden Bans Masks: ‘No Scientific Evidence’ They Prevent COVID](https://principia-scientific.com/sweden-bans-masks-no-scientific-evidence-they-prevent-covid/)\s\sSeems to be one of only a handful of countries left on the planet with a shred of scientific integrity.

Think about that. Our ""left"" wing party here is further right than the Tories or the Likud party. \s\sWe know what the solutions are. The democrats are just helping republicans block them. The system was designed to only take the opinions of the rich into consideration. They've bought ""both"" parties and literally own the media. Acknowledging this sucks but it's the cynical fucking reality.I am to the left of democrats but I am not aggressive. And actually I think that's the problem. Most liberals are not aggressive we want people to be kind to one another take care of each other and protect our civilization so all humans can have better lives. I think that's partially why democrats are soft and give in so much. Conservatives don't have these morals. They only care about their own kind and value aggression competition and violence. It's very hard to compete with them because they are ruthless and really do not care about hurting you. Sorry if this is a loose tangent from the post lol.\s\sI guess what I'm trying to say is that having a strong aggressive alliance to the left of democrats would force some of our efforts into policy. I've heard this suggestion before as it helped during Roosevelt's time having a strong coalition of unions. But it's difficult I think due to our passivity.\s\sThat's why Bernie is such a unicorn he's an aggressively good person.[David Graeber on liberals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9afwZON8dU)> Most liberals are not aggressive we want people to be kind to one another\s\sLiberals are ""woke"" pseudo-conservativesScratch a liberal (or their enabler) and a fascist bleeds.That's an extremely low empathy take.  \s\s""Only we are kind.""yep pretty much.Here's an idea America. Universal healthcare is not actually a leftist idea. It's just a common sense thing everyone sort of agrees with.We need to stop referring to things as leftist and rightist. Why not refer to things as human rightist and non-human rightist?\s\sEither you believe in taking care of everybody for the bigger picture or you don't. Quit beating around the bush with East West North South. There's no color for taking care of people. You either take care of humanity when it doesn't necessarily benefit you immediately or you only care when it's your turn.Universal healthcare is supported by the majority of centrists in America. The Reform Party for example America's leading centrist party wants to solve our healthcare crisis by putting these plans up for a national referendum vote. Our current politicians are the ones standing in the way of what America really wants. What we are doing today in America isn't working for too many people.Good Idea let's put this country that spends every spare cent murdering minorities overseas in charge of what kind of care they get here.

Americans aren't going to vote for weak shit that won't stand up and fight back.  I seem to remember Bernie repeatedly tanking his own campaign by calling Joe Biden his ""good friend"".  Bernie was so soft on Biden during the debates Bernie might as well have been Biden's weighted blanket.  When Biden was grossly and openly racist and Bernie said nothing that was a massive cuck move.  Everyone saw that Biden owned everyone in that room that he could rub his trump stink all over every candidate and nobody dare say anything about it.  That's power.\s\sBernie repeatedly embraced Russiagate which invalidated his entire presidential campaign as a co-conspirator in that baseless conspiracy theory which is exactly what the Democrats wanted him to do.  I seem to remember Bernie abandoning the campaign trail before Iowa and South Carolina to play silly government games that amounted to nothing.  This person clearly wasn't taking the campaign seriously.  We all saw it.  Taking a vacation from the presidential campaign is death delayed for a presidential campaign. AOC was played perfectly by ""master legislator"" Pelosi in that political coupe to align the Trump impeachment trial specifically to hurt Bernie in the critical moments of the primary campaign.\s\sBernie when faced with a clear conspiracy to wrap up the primary for man that didn't even know where he was at his South Carolina victory party repeatedly said nothing and slowly let it all slip away.  Bernie refused to go on the offensive at all during the entire campaign.  It was so pathetic it was shocking like they had a black mail video of Bernie committing a sex crime.  Bernie was practically giving every little shitlib that came by a slobbery knob job during that campaign. What we're we supposed to do?  Carry a dead man that too limp to even stay on his knees for the shitlib's knob job? \s\sWeekend at Bernies was supposed be a silly 80s movie about young men hauling a dead uncle named Bernie around a vacation destination.  Not a 2020 horror movie about an old man that took forty years of good will and spent it all in four months on sheep herding millions back to neoliberal's passive complacency.  Bernie's 2020 collapse was an unforgivable grotesque misuse power.  We threw him the crown and he kicked it into the mud and demand we lick it clean and put it on Biden's ""head"".  Bernie has lost all credibility.Don't shit on me. I believe the ideal Healthcare solution is a truly free market system. Shit on my idea but not my intention.

I completely disagree that innovation is a result of a profit-driven system precisely because the research that is being done and funded by public money will continue no matter what. Researchers barely see any profits to begin with and most of that money wastefully goes to middlemen and giant corporations that exist for no other reason than to extort the population.Your intention is irrelevant because your idea is so dogfuckingly stupid and has already been proven a failure so many times that you should not expect anyone to engage with your ideas.I think the problem is that healthcare should really NOT be profit driven in any way-shape-form.Yeah this kind of attitude is why Bernie has been the president since 2016!!

You either have a bank account anyway and pay fees for not maintaining the minimum balance or you don't have a bank account and pay fees to cash checks and for money orders.

Our system is so messed up that there is no one solution that would benefit everyone. For example I work for a small company and we are reimbursed for insurance premiums.

I can’t afford any of that premium  co pay medical costs to begin with. So I don’t. So now if you take away 1k. I’m paying 1k more then I did before. I can’t afford to live after thatDo you live off of your income tax?> I’m paying 1k more then I did before.\s\sNo you're not.\s\s>I can’t afford to live after that\s\sIf you're on welfare you pay no taxes if your income is that low you pay no taxes.\s\sWe're already paying for your healthcare.You can thank the government for a longer life later. If the govs aren’t protecting their people… even from themselves what are they doing? It’s in societies best interest for everyone to have access to preventive and diagnostic care.i dont even have health insurance so i dont go to the doctor. i will not be a part of this broken systemI'm sorry for you because you're planning on never getting old.  The denial of healthcare may be America's greatest crime against its citizens.My hesitancy is having dealt with government agencies they are extremely unreliable and rarely held accountable. \sCurious ??? why Berners trust any government institutions after the DNC debacles in 2016 & 2020 (fucking over Bernie for Hillary and Joe)Because the DNC is a private entity that owes the general public exactly nothing.ah yes my favorite government agency the DNC> Curious ???\s\sWhy do you trust capitalist entities like corporations in the same way?Its not about their bills... they don;t care. As long as the blacks and the poors are fucked... thats all that matters. have to maintain the social order don't you know. /sSo people are paying thousands more to maintain systematic racism? Sounds like you’re reaching.Why do you think they cut education budgets and don’t increase tea beer salaries?? So they can continue to scam us all!!Are there actual people that really believe that private insurance at these rates is a good thing?Morons who have zero healthcare never go to the doctor have lost half their teeth but still think they're about to become a billionaire any day now.Rich people can afford healthcare now.\s\sThat's all that matters.When I've talked about it with people who are against universal healthcare it's never about actual costs. It's literally because they don't want to contribute to somebody else's healthcare especially if that person isn't from America.Do they know how insurance works?Well tell them they already do.  Hospitals can't turn away someone because they've immigrated illegally.For some people it's the right to pay more while denying others the right to healthcare. Compassionate conservative politics.Vote vote voteWe get reports!\s\s    user reports:  \s    1: If we had Medicare4All you fools would be going around with conspiracies about how guvmut run healthcare is trying to kill you with vaccines.

You would have to wait for all of those facts before you could make this judgement.And another 🐷“Sleeping” family member?Say his name.....Duncan Lemp. Check your facts. Not your privilege! Systemic racism nor white privilege is even close to being an undisputable fact. So why do elites Including bipoc upper-class want to pretend it is? Because they can dangle a cure all for racism while preserving classism for their elitism. Systemic Racism is only 1 out of several forms of bigotry that is a symptom of a disease within our institutions.  Classism is the most deadly symptom.  But the disease itself is Systemic collective narcissism. And our constitution is the remedy for that.Oh thanks for letting me know the cops actually did a good thing for once and killed a terrorist shame they didn't do that at the capitol though.https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\s\sThose seem like abundant facts.\s\sMayor of Louisville Metro in 2020?

Holy shit gunna have some pork tonight boys!There are aspects of this tweet which are just factually inaccurate. That doesn't justify Breonna's death — in any way — but if you want to persuade anyone who cares about evidence repeating falsehoods about the case doesn't help. \s\sThis is a [20-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6_QM8h_u5E) by a former NYPD cop turned lawyer Nate Broady explaining the known facts about the shooting.Rand Paul actually put up a [Justice for Breonna Taylor Act](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/502392-rand-paul-introduces-bill-to-end-no-knock-warrants) to federally ban no knock warrants. Even though I disagree with him on lots of issues this is one I can support. But there is nothing but crickets from Democrats.And put these kids with guns and a badge back in school.

How the fuck was Taylor and her boyfriend supposed to hear it in the middle of the night? He was totally in the right for defending himself and his girlfriend.\s\sFuck you broThere was no reason for a no knock warrant. Their reaction to fire at people invading their home is completely justified. \s\sEven just from a strategic breaching standpoint the lack of accountability for all officers involved is an issueOh yes let's all support her drug dealing boyfriend who blamed the shooting on her after she died for his shooting at RANDOM people who burst in the door screaming ""police"". People forget this chick was found with a dead drug dealer in her rental car and knew 2 different in jail drug dealers who were recorded bragging about keeping shit at her house.This has got to be one of the stupidest posts I’ve seen on Reddit. The one situation where we can all agree that cops can shoot is when they are shot at first. Everyone knows that owning a gun increases the likelihood of being shot. Had the boyfriend not had a gun Breonna would have survived the police raid.\s\sBtw I can always count on Bernie supporters to downvote comments that make sense. Downvote to your heart’s content. In Bernie subs being downvoted means you’re comment is reasonable.> The one situation where we can all agree that cops can shoot is when they are shot at first.\s\sThere's a big ol caveat in that... do the people shooting at the cops *know* that they are shooting at cops? If not then as far as they know they would just be shooting at people with guns who *may* be shooting at them.Damn that leap in logic between ""Boyfriend had a gun"" and ""shoot a sleeping woman"" do you also think black ink on newspapers is somehow a leftist conspiracy?Please tell me you're joking?You can fuck off4th but technically original 🐷This sounds Less like Real life and more like the plot to a Liam Nieson Movie.No[deleted][deleted]You just told the universe you are perfectly willing to allow cops to go into go to your house and kill you or another loved one “for evidence”\s\sYou best be hopin the Law of Attraction isn’t realI thought her boyfriend shot at the police and When they shot back one of the bullets hit her? \s\sNot trying to be hurtful that’s just what I’ve heardImo if you aren't wearing a badge and uniform you arent the police and cannot be expected to be treated like the police.  You're effectively a civilian even if your job title might  be ""police officer.""\s\sOtherwise criminals can easily take advantage of pretending to be the police because they don't need to prove actual authority.This comment got downvoted because it had the truth LMFAO.  She was dating a drug dealer who shot at the police and they shot back.  The left totally ignores this.  They even say some bullshit like they weren’t even cops LOL what do you mean? They had their badges and everythingWhen I saw the posts from my family demonizing this person I didn't know what to do.People are selfish and evil get used to it.\s\s\sEdit: oh also this is not to disregard the efforts to fight injustice. This is more for the snowflakes that don't understand pain. Also for the evil people that don't understand they are evil.That's a pussy way of looking at a system that needs changed.The cops were already tried and one was found guilty of reckless endangerment.  So unless you have some information that the jury is wrong on this one you're SOL.Of which the jury is now suing the ag over due to the corruption associated with the case. Fuck you bro.[removed]What the hell is wrong with this thread. I don’t tolerate white supremacist talking points and neither should this sub.Arguing for justice for Breonna Taylor's murder will never be white supremacy.Cops are tools/pawns they do what they are told. We gotta change the laws and how they enforce em. Fascists love following orders we just got to give them new ones. To be clear talking about the criminal justice system in general not Brianna Taylor's tragedyThey weren't looking for Taylor's ex-boyfriend they were looking for evidence so why is this tweet trying to misdirect what the purpose of the warrant was for? Also by the time the police entered the apartment Breonna and her boyfriend were awake and standing outside of their bedroom.""Well officer it's totally OK that you mowed down my family. After all you were after evidence that could be obtained at any time and my family *was* standing outside their bedroom when you blew them away!""[deleted]They did finally the corrupt AG threw the case.I'm sorry are you people seriously upvoting a post lobbying against letting all the facts come out before making judgement? Fuck no knock warrants but this shit is fucking retarded.I found a 🐷[deleted]Um...which party is that?  I'm guessing the uni party since fighting and cheating the working class is the favorite past time of both blue and red and one of the things they tend to openly agree on.You cannot stop using fossil fuel - millions of people would freeze to death or starve to death without it. \sIf you’re poor enough to not afford health insurance you could be on public assistance. \sSocialism leads to communism. \sYou’re being conditioned to view your freedom as selfishness.Nobody is saying to stop using fossil fuels they’re saying that the threat level of global warming is at an all time high and it’s time for a transition into cleaner renewable energy sources. You don’t need to point out to the rest of us who support Bernie and the green new deal that fossil fuel transition doesn’t happen overnight. We know this. The fact is that fossil fuel companies are selfish conglomerates that put the money in their pockets over your and your families health and safety. They funnel millions of dollars into the effort of denying climate change even though scientist have proven it to be true over the last 30 years. This has nothing to do with socialism and even if it was there is no substantial evidence that socialism leads to communism you’re just spitting out opinions at that point. You’re being conditioned to believe that capitalism buys your freedom when in fact capitalism is what gives millionaires freedom and keeps everyone else towards the bottom. There’s a reason the middle class is dead and struggling in this country and I’ll give you a hint it has nothing to do with socialism. I make almost 3 figures a year yet still can’t buy a house. I pay $4000 a year in health insurance I don’t use and anytime I have used it nothing is covered because I can never meet my insanely high deductible. Technically if I were sick I wouldn’t be able to afford the insurance that I have cause the coverage Is terrible. I’m just living day to day hoping I don’t end up in the hospital because of the fear of getting sued by the hospital. And you can say that’s normal all you want but consider this: Americans are the ones dealing with this problem because we are the only ones with such a broken and segregated economy and health care system.FO 26 DAY OLD ACCOUNT!! \s\sTROLL!!Take your bullshit on down the road asshole. Fossil fuels are already old news.Let's suppose you're driving 80mph in your car. If you were to suddenly stop the car going from 80mph to 0mph in an instant you would be thrown forward and get seriously hurt.\s\sWhen we say ""stop the car"" - that's not what we mean. We mean apply the brakes and slow down until the car is no longer moving.\s\s""stop using fossil fuel"" means to transiting to other fuel sources in a gradual manner that allows us to keep people alive and save the environment with the goal of eventually not using fossil fuel.Do NOT comment with abuse vulgar insults or threats like the Nazis you are. **pretends to care about people while cursing and threatening someone for their opinion 🤡🤡**I want to see all of these people that were voter shaming on a daily basis come out and support their Corporate King but they won't because they are spinless frauds who are in positions of privilege. Anyone who's been following this shit show and been a part of the Progressive movement could have predicted what Biden was going to start doing because we've already learned better.Few men change their playbook after 50 years. Especially when it lands them the presidency.What has Biden started doing?“That’s why I didn’t start a third party after being cheated in 2016 and didn’t run as an independent after getting screwed in 2020 because this is all so important”Normal as in airstriking Middle Eastern civiliansI take it this was prior to the Great Capitulation after which Biden was the Savior Of The World who would heal the land once the evil Trump is ousted much like the end of The (original otherwise known as the actually good) Lion King.\s\sBiden is terribleas terrible if not worse than Trumpas we predicted but Bernie won't have any cred to point it out after that whole long stint of hard selling literal shit on a shingle as the cure or what ails us and calling dissenters to the idea reckless children.  His only remaining hope is to actually defy the establishment consistently no kid gloves and go for the well-meaning useful idiot who saw the light and fucking stick to it.  Like Daou.Bernie advocated for Warren as Secretary of Treasury. The guy is a hypocrit. I'm no longer surprised by his lack of an opposition during the primary. You let the country down when you were needed the most.Yes I'm sure she didn't mean anything bad when she lied to the press and told them you scoffed at the idea of a female president and certainly would never stab you in the back again.Then... maybe... you should have actually attempted to run for the presidency instead of just handing the whole thing over to Joe the oligarch bro. Only person you have to blame for this ruin is staring at you in your bathroom mirror.Third party time. Enough is enough. I voted Joe to get Don out but never again. Movement for a People’s Party is where I will be moving forwardPeople always say that but then the next Republican us just so much more obnoxious that they always go ""well just this once more then I'm done"".  It's literally the basis of uni party strategy for curtailing our votes between two identical parties and accepting any form if fascism as long as its not *that guy's* form.if fascism.  They've mastered the art of political vaudeville.> I voted Joe to get Don out but never again.\s\sNever again until next time when they give you a choice between shit and shittier.Yeah way to stick it to em! They’re gonna get the message in the millisecond it takes to count your vote for himfuck third party for now.  Look at what Alaska deep blood red Alaska went and voted themselves ranked choice.  It passed by a cunt hair but it passed and now they can hopefully move the needle.  If your state can get to ranked choice vote for libs or green or what the fuck ever but if you vote for them now without ranked choice you really are throwing it away.

Twice.What actually happened? I'm not american but I've seen huge support for Bernie and then out of nowhere he ""dropped out of the race"". What was the cause or reason provided?As long as you keep fighting in the primary...Then why did you endorse the “nothing will fundamentally change” guy?Lol this was during the primaries. When it looked like he was boutta win. 😢that's nice.  maybe Bernie should run for president.  but actually run.Don't be naive. He doesn't have a chance in the corrupt 2 party system.And this is why the stop Bernie movement can never be forgiven or forgotten""This Joe Biden character seems pretty terrible. Good thing I endorsed...""\s\s[checks notes]\s\s""...I've made a huge mistake.""This is true just kinda is contradictory for him to be saying after he immediately endorsed Biden after dropping out. he was endorsing biden BEFORE he dropped out.This is an old tweet.Endorsement doesn’t mean you’re 100% agreeing with them. Well maybe if yorue a trumpie.... lmao.Okay Biden shills you made your bed now lie in it!Looks like Bernie is a giant hypocrite who sold out his own movement by endorsing a corporate plutocrat.Bernie is cancelled 😞You know what Bernie should do for the rest of his time in office? Take every single one of those bullshit omnibus bills break it up into individual bills and reintroduce the parts that aren't total bullshit. AOC should do the same in the House. Then the two of them can go out in public and talk about how they tried to avoid more corporate handouts but the speaker and the house majority leader wouldn't bring the individual bills to a vote.But I will bet neither of them do anything of the kind...Dude you phrased it like a swear in the begining i legit thought those littke pieces were gonna end up some were else.[removed]Already too late for that.

These days Bernie is just running interference for the bad guys. It'd be awesome if that changed recently...Bernie must know that he's not going to get the Labor Secretary position he's been lobbying for! Uncle Joe is a Scorpio like myself and we don't trust Bernie so we're going to leave him right there in Congress where he belongs!I can't tell if this is a joke or not but if it is be careful there are people who actually think like this lolI guess something changed between the time he posted this [March 9 Tweet](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1237067549688332290) and when he spent like... *seven months* [repeatedly](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/14/bernie-sanders-says-opposing-joe-biden-irresponsible/2993775001/) asking [everyone](https://www.voanews.com/2020-usa-votes/sanders-urges-progressives-keep-agenda-alive-vote-biden) to [vote](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/05/bernie-sanders-job-biden-donald-trump-presidential-campaign/3623526001/) for Biden?\s\sI get that you're not mindless robots who have to do whatever Bernie says but ya'll spend a lot of time quoting him when it suits you and ignoring him when it doesn't.Just a few weeks ago your comment would have been heavily upvoted on this sub. It looks like the DNC troll farms are still in full swing and have set their sights on this sub.Yea it’s almost like some people can have some takes we agree on and some that we don’t. It’s really not that hard. He said that and he’s right he also said everyone vote for Biden which most of his supporters did. I’m hardly seeing any argument hereI'm gonna be really happy when Bernie Sanders dies. He's pretty old so it won't be long hopefully.> I'm gonna be really happy when Bernie Sanders dies \s\sAnd nobody will give a shit when you do.I bet your parents are disappointed in you. At the very least they should be.\s\sAlso FYI there’s more people like him and we’re growing in numbers...and we are far less conservative than he is.\s\sThe future is bright comrade get used to it.Damn right. Too bad there are a ton of people in the country who don’t get and likely never willThey are brainwashedVote blue and then fuck youThan why bend the knee without extracting concessions from Biden ?Idk. imo they threatened Bernie with something. Maybe throwing his wife in jail about that land deal. Or maybe Bernie would have had another “heart attack” had Biden not won? \s\sI’m just glad that Bernie’s back. I know this isn’t a popular opinion here but Biden being in the White House prevents the brunch liberals from losing their minds over every Trump tweet. Now Bernie and everyone else can focus on the matter at hand.Because the military industrial complex fossil fuel companies and big banks et al control Biden can bribe Trump and own both parties - prefer Biden but would rather Trump win than give in to progressives at all. Bernie chose to help Biden get in (lesser of two evils) and hope to reason with his admin or build a progressive squad that is big enough to have negotiating power but there is no leverage (yet) for progressives to force their hand at anything.\s\sThat is changing slowly based on the power of progressive policies to win this cycle but Democratic neo-libs are still trying to identity-politics their way into the hearts of the American Public - at least enough to calm the mass unrest while changing nothing.\s\sThe Democrats Mass Media hell the voting machines wouldn’t let Bernie win. The most that Bernie could do was torpedo Biden’s chances by speaking out against him or doing nothing - but the alternative was Dumb Hitler. So what would you do?\s\sBernie chose harm-reduction (even sad incremental harm-reduction) and threw his considerable weight behind Biden because he cares about individuals and lived to fight another day. \s\sEssentially Biden’s masters would rather see him lose to Trump than accept the Green New Deal. Because of this Bernie had no leverage.Haven’t you read Biden’s platform? On paper Biden’s been moved really far left relative to American politics. Now whether he’s lying or not...What concessions could Biden give you that you would believe he would follow through onBernie is so great.  If only he ran for President.  Oh well.  He at least has that trophy wife.He got his goal of getting Trump out and now he's going to push Biden. I like it.[deleted]He got the goal of replacing one corporate puppet with another. YayAlso means getting more involved with the Middle EastBlast from the past.\s\s It is getting to be that you need to consult a timeline to keep track of Bernie's ever changing positions.I was gonna say that's not recent right??Basically what Biden was saying without saying:  That was a nice tantrum you threw America.  But classic political corruption is *back on the menu!*Lmao missed ur shot my dude. Got cuckedIf you are talking about Bernie you’re right. He missed his chance to get any kind of concession from Biden by demanding it before dropping out and endorsing. BTW those concessions would have benefitted you and your family and every other working-class American so maybe you shouldn’t be so happy about the shit sandwich you are eating brah! Unless you are rich in that case get fucked then go die. Or just die.Bernie is getting to Grandpa Simpson levels of screaming at a cloud.  Bernie you had opportunities to make change happen.  Instead you threw in with the very people preventing the change you wanted.And fucking laughed about it publicly without fear of consequences.  ""I beat the socialist!""Yet bernie rolled over like a dog to biden[removed][deleted]So predictable. Now that Biden won he's back to being angry. But wait. In two years he'll be back to endorsing the same crappy neoliberal corporatist Democrats. After that election he'll go back to being angry.\s\sAnybody see a pattern here?This is from March I think.Time for him to join the People's Party. Fuck the DemocratsI've read speculation the Bernie  was going to be a progressive pain in the ass. I hope he is. We shall see.Oh yeah he's going to write some tweets and give some speeches on the Senate floor. I bet the ruling class are shaking in their boots!Fuck Bernie for endorsing Biden.  All of this means shit now.[removed]When did he tweet this? I don't see a date.It's from last spring when he was still running in the primary:\s\shttps://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/posts/we-cannot-return-to-normal-we-need-real-change/2912554885466163/😆😆😆 seeing as how 250000 - 400000 people die a year from medical malpractice according to johns Hopkins wouldn't the number of deaths from medical malpractice also go up and undermine the supposed 70k that are being saved? Also shes an idiot if she thinks a government program is going to ""save billions of dollars""Why are you even here?All that money we save...""BUT WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR I- oh wait""Well would you look at that the Democratic party murdered 70000 people in 2020. Chump numbers if you ask the Republicans but respectable nontheless. It's diary must look very strange; woke up this morning death death death death death cup of coffee death death death death death death Sex in the City death death death...> Well would you look at that the Democratic party murdered 70000 people in 2020. \s\sWe have seen nothing yet.\s\sJoe Biden is popping Viagra at the thought of throwing 15 million people out of their homes in the middle of a pandemic.  He is going to shatter Obama's 5.1 million numberClearly your priorities are twisted. What is more important? 70000 lives a year or hundreds of billions of dollars of profits?\s\sAre you a commie?The progressives should demand a vote on this in the house or threaten to withdraw their vote to elect nancy pelosi as speaker. Easy way to get medicareM4A...??? That's more a Beijing thanks to Mao Caracas thanks to HUGO Moscow (left over from commie) Havana thanks to Fidel Che and the other heroic revolutionaries or Shelbyville just to be silly kinda thing. Except that in times of humanity threatening pandemic those evil commie bastid Cubanos make house calls... with medicine... the horror the horror. Nothing is too vicious for them. So as a result you can be assured that U$ propaganda will fabricate or propigate evil about them like El sexto jailed for months for insulting Fidel and Raul. That might be true but what is definitely true and unstated is that during the time el sexto was apparently incarcerated U$ kkkops murdered three people a day in land of the brave and free. Largely racist motivated. One of America's biggest problems is its ku klux kops. No matter how you slice it Amerikkka imprisons more and certainly murders many more extra judicially than the zero cuban extra judicial murders. \s\sThe $450000000000 will be money taken from the poor but that same poor will have 70000 fewer mouths to feed.\s\sLet's attempt a total.\s\s50~100 million murdered in the genocide probably half a million dead in the slave passage 5~7000 lynched and massacred post slavery. Actually relative few murders but as barbaric cruel and painful as possible during slavery. Profit and property management. Since the civil war America's incursions and U$biz involvement in WWI and WWII would seem to put much of the well over a hundred million deaths on America's plate. U$ military industrial complex being by far the planet's worst polluter... well you can see that how much to credit America with keeping the population down is difficult to ascertain.\s\sYou can also see that it is very difficult to put even vague numbers on it and we must just accept that no country since the beginning of time has come close to the theft and murders on Americas blotter.\s\sKkkop murders are over a thousand a year currently and if we assume that there were none the day that largely U$biz fomented war ended round it down to a thousand annually and assume the increase was gradual and consistent in the 75 years since WWII it estimates to  37500 killings by cops. That's not the good look America believes it is. It is the look of stark racist barbarity.Unfortunately the pandemic is revealing to America just how expendable so many of us think our fellow Americans are.And how hypocritical our ""caring"" about other people's heath really is.Of course it would. There is only one reason we can't have it--profit. I don't have any easy answers but we need to fight this militantly. There are now millions of new uninsured people and people forced into expensive Obamacare. This should be easier than it is but our politicians are intractable.\s\sedit to add: I'm watching Sirota on Jimmy Dore now. He makes a good point about politicians being willing to do harm. They aren't there to govern for all the people only the owners of the country. So the only things left are strikes and revolution.How stupid is this!  Obamacare has destroyed our healthcare and this will increase the decline.You base this on what?The lancet study has a lot of problems with it. I suggest you guys read this fact check on it it goes over it well: https://khn.org/news/bernie-sanders-embraces-a-new-study-that-lowers-medicare-for-alls-price-tag-but-skepticism-abounds/Your alleged refutation of the Yale study is an article on a Kaiser Perm website. Ignoring that conflict of interest you've linked an article by a journalist as opposed to research study with the time rigors and resources of an academic paper.\s\sI think on this sub at least many would not give a darn if there were 0 savings as long as people had access to quality care and didn't have to wager their (and their family's) financial future to get it. to be clear our current system does not remotely accomplish either of these goals. Again i think many on this sub would admit M4A is not perfect nor would the implementation be easy - insurance companies would/do fight teeth and nail to hamoer it by any means - but unless someone has a better plan it seems to be the best we've got. \s\sAt a minimum unless you have something that stops tying Healthcare to employment ensures minors total coverage abolishes the fanciful concept of ""pre-existing conditions"" reduces the cost of prescriptions and ends medical related bankruptcy especially for emergency care when people inherently cannot price shop then M4A looks pretty sweet.\s\sAlso your username checks out. If only you could see a doctor for help with that. Too bad they don't take reddit awards lmaoI'd love to see you take the time to discredit 22 studies stating Medicare for All would save money not just one.\s\shttps://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/484301-22-studies-agree-medicare-for-all-saves-money\s\sIn science it's called replication.

What’s also insane is that the very people who would benefit from healthcare for all scream ‘socialism’ whenever it is mentioned. Did I say insane?52% of Republicans support Medicare For AllWell yes *but* it would also deprive the middleman insurance industrial complex from extracting wealth from people in exchange for their well-being.And we cannot allow that now can weWhAt aBoUt tHe uNiOnS tHaT nEgOtIaTeD cOvErAgE?!?!I like how there's a million people screaming about the ""cost"" of M4A but whenever a study like this comes up they flatly refuse to see it. I recall one of the ""Biden shamers"" back in October straight up calling the study ""fake news"" and if that doesn't demonstrate how little difference there is between the MAGA crowd and Biden's people then I don't know what does.Yes centrists moderates neoliberal the whole entire right wing don’t want m4a. They don’t want progress. They want to keep things the way they are or regress things to how they were. Center-left and left from there want “progress” for the people. Shorten the wealth gap more rights for the common citizen human rights like healthcare and a livable wage. Unfortunately because of propaganda only a portion of Americans want progress for themselves. They want to keep things how they are and brings things back to how they used to be mostly socially. The good thing is that the youth want progress especially the educated ones. They want equality even if they currently have privileges now. So the hope is that in 25 years our youth of today will be the country’s leaders and we will progress thenit was really surprising how ignorant and spiteful some of them can be on this topic I've had ""debates"" where they sounded exactly like a Trump zealot backtracking pivoting and posting random talking points whenever you corner them on any particular point ignoring every link you post to back your argument and offering none to back their's ending every sentence with ""you dumbfuck"" or similar treating ""socialist"" as some kind of insult.\s\sit really gave me the impression that Trump doesn't have a monopoly on militant belligerent easilly manipulated people who have no idea wtf they are talking about. at least Trump supporters  have the whole ""destroying our way of life"" mentality to fuel them whereas  these are simply different implementations of the same basic end goals.Does this include tax revenue from the 70000 people who won't die and quit working? Or how they can stimulate the economy by not being dead?We need to be fighting tooth and nail for this. The fact that there's so much pushback against forcing a vote on the House floor shows just how many people have been propagandized to fight against any push towards it.But the wealthy would suffer from longer wait times\s/sI’m so sick of hearing this argument and the whole “well WhO’S gUnnA pAy fuRrit?...nUt mE I tELL u wHuT!”Capitalism depends on and therefore creates difference. \s\sIt uses difference as a cudgel - ""serve the system or end up like those people without insurance."" It uses difference as markers for the meritocracy - ""you worked hard now you deserve to live in less fear and more comfort."" \s\sBut most of all it uses difference to keep people from coalescing around shared material conditions - ""now you'll never get enough numbers together to oppose the owners of this country.""\s\sSame can be said for housing food education.\s\sSo another way to look at the problem is - how do you give people healthcare without disrupting all the necessary differences? How do you tell people they're still better and more comfortable than someone else?Anyone interested to figure out if this is actually true?\s\sIf so I am certain there is way to get this passed.\s\sAs long as private insurance market is still available.Fuck the private insurance market. The only way to make sure that it's a quality program is for rich and poor alike to have the same coverage. It's also the only way to ensure lower costs through monopsony. And that the program isn't rolled back. Private insurance needs to be eliminated from the face of the earth.I’m pretty sure “Medicare for all” implies that it’s supposed to insure everyone with Medicare. Making it so there’s only a public option and not private options is part of what makes it so much cheaper so private insurers can’t refuse to insure certain people that are more costly to insure and dump them onto public insurers making the public system a more expensive system.https://pjmedia.com/trending/great-news-medicare-for-all-would-save-450-billion-a-year-and-save-68000-lives/Or we could think of it as: Private for-profit health insurance kills nearly 70000 Americans and wastes (or makes rich people richer) $450 billion each and every year.He’s a disgusting piggy[removed]Stop applying for jobs online.

They own all the important land they own and control the corporations that've long since bought and paid for the senate the congress the state houses the city halls they got the judges in their back pocket and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and the information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want. Well we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.STEM classes involving hydroponics and food production could provide the schools with fresh greens and vegetables should they choose to adopt such pre-existing programs.My school had an agricultural science class and people just dismissed it as a class for rednecks that wanted to ride John Deere tractors all day.

These things are just common sense acts of humanity and civility. You don't need ideology just basic principles.[deleted]I'm with you.  I don't actually believe it's ethical to make more humans to live on this planet right now.Yep wife and I have decided not to have children due to healthcare and childcare predatory costs.  We would just be setting them on the debt train for the rest of their lives.  Disgusting.Not really. They'll just learn to survive the old fashioned wayI was 18 when Obama ran against McCain. All through High School I was really interested in politics but was just a standard Blue MAGA that thought the GOP were the bad guys and the Dems were the good guys. Like I'd watch fucking CNN and Crossfire when I got home from school (no wonder I didn't have any friends). \s\sMy mom was a big supporter of Nader and said both sides worked for the same people. I just thought she was too jaded or cynical. A lot of my world view was forged during the Dubya years and the War on Terror... I was absolutely disgusted by him and I totally bought all of Obama's bullshit hook line and sinker. \s\s08 was the last time I voted for a Dem. Felt pretty betrayed by Obama but I also realized why my mom was so ""cynical."" He really wasn't all that different from Dubya.I was 34. My son had been born the month before the election. I had voted for Clinton in 1992 was fairly new Democrat at that time and agreed with the Clinton style/approach only to move further and further left after I got out of school and experienced life a bit. I remember a poli sci teacher at uni telling me the only way to change politics was blow something up. I saw how swiftly things got done for the bad with an unpopular cheater like Bush ... but I had hope built up with the blogs for a revolution. Obama wasn't my first choice in 2008 but by the time he got the nom I was sold. And we got 60 Senators. Holy shit this was a dream. But hijinx ensued with getting Franken seated and then Teddy dropped dead and so for a drink of water we had 60 but nothing got done because the Liebermans and about 7 others all made sure that we needed bipartisanship. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sThat was when I was out. Never voted for Dems again outside of case by case basis. Also my tolerance for pols who backtrack on promises is now 0.Same the Obama betrayal opened my eyes to the shit that had been going on. Before that I thought Clinton was some kind of saint and then the sheen started to fade the more I read. \s\sThen the warmonger Hillary acolyte of Kissinger did her bit too. And the adulation she received from people around me just seemed too much of a cult without any attention to what she was actually doing. \s\sThen Bernie and on and on..\s\sRead the book *Listen Liberal* if you get a chance.I gotta say I love your mom. She's a smart lady! I voted for Nader in 2000. Even before this I knew but 21 years ago I said the same thing. Bill Clinton showed us that the Democrats are just as bad as the Republicans and were basically on the same side. Nothing has changed except gotten worse maybe.\s\sSmart woman and raised a smart person!I been poor and felt embarrassed of subsidized or free lunch. But those kids traumatized before school starts should be ready to learn right? All lives matter as long as they can pay their own way. GTFOH! Priorities Priorities!San Diego schools have a total budget $1.6 billion btw. About 3 times that of the police budget.Do you have sources?Sounds less like capitalism vs socialism more like local corruption.I will never forget the feeling of being $20 in lunch debt and having my food taken away. They gave me fucking crackers and I had to watch everyone else eat full meals. Nobody helped.Not to sound rude but why couldn’t your parents provide lunch?How in the sweet ever loving fuck can a child in the United States accrue debt while attending public school? \s\sI'm not American but you guys have some serious shit to work out.[deleted]I think at one time the cafeteria was part of the school budget. Now they've hired outside vendors who want to be paid. The debt comes from their parents not paying school fines or for students' lunches. It's the parents' debt the kids are paying the price for. And it is still disgusting on each and every level.Pure unfiltered Capitalism that is practiced only in the United States is all fun and games when there's plenty to go around with enough for all the mouths to feed. Say for example you just won a world war and all the remaining wealth and means of production are in your country. It's great then. \s\sNow on the other hand when you are competing with other rising economies across the globe you start to see the cracks in the system.\s\sThat's what nobody really wants to talk about. Capitalism goes hand in hand with war it's predicated on the necessity for war and it cannot thrive without the continued perpetuation of war.I’m a former ultra conservative. Seeing what those people believe and having believed those same ideas at one point I now see that they must be stopped at all costs.What changed your mind? If you don't mind me asking?Bernie going soft on the Democratic Party.  If Bernie can be turned after hanging tough for four decades there is no way to salvage this mess.  Clear the chess board the sunk cost fallacy is killing us.Can we do a gofundme and get these KIDS “debts” paid?Not directed at you but how can Children legally have ""debt"" in the first place?Just vote for candidates that will give more money to public schools.I lived in the Dominican Republic for two years a very impoverished country compared to the US where collection of taxes is extremely difficult. Despite this they provide bread and milk for the kids at school once a day. Given how much Americans pay in taxes the pictured lunch is a fucking joke.Wait so if all lunch ladies just stopped following those rules and gave all kids fair lunches who gonna stop them? They can't fire *all* of them.\s\sAnd if politicians try to say some shit about it just use ""so you do t care about kids eating properly?""\s\sI was lucky at my school our lunch ladies didn't give a single fuck. You could go through line with 2 full trays and as long long you paid you were OK (rule was 1 tray per person) everyone pretty much knew the free lunchers and the lunch ladies wouldnt care if they got normal lunch so long as they paid the $2.25-$4. Forget how much it wasHow long ago was that? In California at least even giving out a free slice of pizza is ""stealing"" and a write up offense. These ladies make less than 35k a year in California and are usually older with health issues that require medical insurance. You want them to risk their health insurance so kids can eat a little better? Instead the parents should be standing up to the school boards and other entities that dictate the school meals. Vote out the superintendent vote out the school board vote out city council and take over. \s\sIt isn't the lunch lady's job to secure funding for student meals it is the parents/community votersYeah not sure I was just doing my job is a great defense.I kind of have a hard time believing this happened being that my daughter had lunch $ acct in debt a # of times bc it's hard to stay on top of everything and i wpuld just get robocalls until i paid it but she got to still get whatever she wanted at lunch. Sounds like a really shit school principal if this actually happenedMy mom worked for years for SD schools as the pastry chef many moons ago. After she retired she wanted to keep busy and worked on call as a lunch lady a few times a month or to cover vacations and such. There was one elementary school she hated being called to because they more often than not ran out of food at third lunch. Of course this was in a disadvantaged neighborhood and some of these kids would have this as their only meal. She had to give them corn. Just a pile of corn on the tray. Any concern she raised was met with an apathetic shrug. She finally quit and just volunteered at a senior center to keep herself busy.San Diego schools have a budget of 1.6 billion. More than enough to feed kids.Where the fuck is it going then?&#x200B;\s\sbooksIsrael can promote laws in the US but we can't even get the minimum wage increased.I don’t know why people aren’t freaking out over this.

Try defunding the Central govt and abolishing central banking. 💁The central government would really like to take over policing since the the locals are doing such a poor job.Slavery never truly went away.

It's a system of training a culture and a cultural approach to our entire criminal justice system that's seriously in need of an overhaul. Sure convict the killer cops but destroy the system that has made them all too commonplace as well.That's because slavery  was meant to control a particular race of people  for their rich masters.Police racism is different.\s\sPolicing is part of our system of INSTITUTIONAL racism which is meant to control us ALL.\s\sFor OUR rich masters.\s\sIt divides us up and sets us against one-anotherrather neatly.\s\sAnd its self-reinforcingtoo.\s\sWhile I believe that institutional racism arose organicallyI also believe it didn't take too long for the rich bastards that run this country to recognize it as an excellent tool for controlling the peasantry.\s\sIts entire PURPOSE is to exacerbate race relations and keep the Public divided.\s\sthat's why it isn't going anywhere.\s\sIt exists to protect the rich donors that both parties rely on for donations.\s\sI would also posit that we ended race-based slavery not because it was brutal and morally repugnant; we ended it in favor of a cheapermore efficient system of slavery that would encompass the entire non-rich population.[deleted]if you say what the hivemind echo wants to hear you get rewarded. if you bring up difficult and complex issues on twitter with dumbed down simplistic ideology you get a cookie. sure people get that twatter is accessible to the masses and they haven't banned or censored any of the lefty ideological rhetoric yet. independents are some of the more knowledgeable political candidates out there in this country this ain't it.\s\s>Policing is part of our system of INSTITUTIONAL racism which is meant to control us ALL. \s\swould that mean its no longer about race then. are we actually back to occupy 2011 before the masses got swayed away from injustice and inequality and threw themselves into the media gauntlet of partisan division and segregation by race. that likely will not happen until race is removed from the ideological rhetoric and citizens return to focusing on people as human beings not different races who cant read drivers licenses or have childhood knife fights. if really concerned about people take a break from making mean tweets on your iphone it was made in china with the lefts beloved slave labor.\s\sno were just going to go about our child hood knife fights alrighty then.Are you high on crack?

Even the most die-hard thin-blue-line-idiots don't think that.Even when people are killed while complying people defend the police saying the guy had a record or the cop perceived him as a threat.\s\sYes people do believe this. Especially cops.""well he should have just complied"" is one of the most common responses any time someone gets killed by police. Nobody likes to explicitly admit that they think like this but a lot of people justify itFrom qualified immunity to the 1000 annual killings by police that result in little to no consequences I'd argue there's a legitimate point being made here. Nowhere else in the industrialized world do we see such rampant police brutality.You’d be surprisedIs it damp under that rock?BuT iT’s HaRd To Be A cOp It’S dAnGeRoUs\s\s/s“Burnout from the workplace” should mean immediate re-assignment and counselling for any officer\s\sPoor work performance increases the risk of fatal negligence \s\sIgnorance can’t be a shield for passivity and lack of vigilanceImagine a cop asking someone to put their weapon down and they instead shoot the cop.

And just maybe the public would be less likely to run away scared from armed individuals deciding wether they should die or not die on personal perception of a crime.Maybe yes but also what if the cop didn’t do things they were supposed to do. I got a compromise cops stop being bad and criminals start being good. And if you are an innocent person who’s life was taken away ummm... good luck?\s\s\s\sYes less people would die if they listened to cops. But maybe if cops could handle certain situations better among other things then maybe they wouldn’t be in all of those positions in the first place.That is absolute horseshit. Of course there is an absolute lack of accountability around police violence/murder. There is SO much work to be done around policing beginning with ending the war on drugs. But no one thinks cops should get to kill compliant people. And very few people believe cops should get to kill non-compliant people.

That means my self awareness (if I dont black out) cant supersede the involuntary reaction my brain has. Even if im not being difficult the stress in itself can cause my body to shut down. Imagine all i do is collapse to the ground many people would definitely deem that as non-compliance. Ya know if I have a male cop trying to touch me in uncomfortable ways is it a surprise that I could have a ptsd episode? I feel like people seriously do not think about situations like this.Shoulda followed the law sweet heart.

But society believes this because we aren’t taught anything about this stuff in our educational system.

So yay!Billionaire Trump himself said in 2016 Presidential Debate with that LOSER Hilary that it was smart of him to pay no taxes. I loved that Trump was so open about telling the shenanigans 1% play and how dirty are our politicians. 1% pay no taxes because their wealth is tied to stocks. You only pay taxes when you sell those stock which creates taxable event but they off set it by donating same amount of money made from that transaction so end result is ZERO tax.Ouch. That stings cuz it’s so sad but true[deleted]Smugness is mostly to other countrie at home we mostly complainThe US does good in education. In both terms of quality and how educated the population is.\s\sI can’t find a ranking for the Netherlands though perhaps lack of data taken there?The Netherlands has mandatory private insurance. https://wise.com/gb/blog/healthcare-system-in-the-netherlands Really glad this is true but I’ll be more impressed when the Dutch do this for 300+ million people. They’ve done it for 17+ million.So what you're saying is that our economy and workforce is so much larger we can easily do this? Awesome.Size of New York basically. So what you’re saying is that all of our states the size of New York or smaller can do this. That’s awesome because only 3 states are bigger.https://spendmenot.com/blog/what-percentage-of-americans-are-millionaires/It doesn't cost more per capita you idiot. If anything it probably costs far less per person if you have a larger insurance pool.\s\sI mean are you really so stupid that you don't know how health insurance works?Let’s not leave out the tax rate of the Netherlands.(50-60%) But their government also requires all adults living or working in the Netherlands to have basic insurance. The basic plan will cost € 100-120 out of pocket. Seeing a doctor can be easy when it’s something deadly but anything less than that and it becomes difficult due to the shortage of doctors and increases in patients. Another factor in the Netherlands that plays a role in costs is their diet it’s one of the healthiest places in the world to eat having a low obesity rate plays into costs. \s\sThey have a big bike culture there because owning a car is a luxury granted to those that need it less cars on the roads equals more people using public transportation the more people using public transportation the better it becomes. \s\sHigh quality education comes at a costs to the tax payer too that of which the government has regulated it’s costs like their healthcare system but it’s not free.\s\sNow as an American I can choose to insure myself without the expense of everyone else’s bad habits I could get treatment for minor issues faster than any Dutchman could ever dream of emergency care as well in addition to driving myself in a vehicle that I have the choice to own.You're missing the point that it is about the people that can't afford those things not the people who can.  No doubt being well off sure is nice and gives you lots of options in life but that's not the discussion.  Also if you lost your job because of something out of your control like say a pandemic then everything you just mentioned that you thought you had is pulled out from under your feet.The thing that I don't think a lot of people realize but you're almost touching on is that a healthy population is essential to public healthcare.\s\sIt's so essential infact that the government puts a LOT of emphasis on making sure their population stays healthy by use of things like Sugartax fat tax maximum and minimum requirements of foods subsidizing fruits/greens/dairy/healthy living **making it cheaper and more convenient to ride a bike than a drive a car**. \s\sCountries with public healthcare have healthier populations because the governments actively try to stop the citizens being unhealthy as it's a massive expense they can cut. Currently there's very few of these systems in place in the US and it makes it harder and harder to start public healthcare.Great stuff as long as you can afford it which is not the case for too many peopleIn Europe we want the same tax regulation for everyone...\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Sandwich?wprov=sfla1As a Dutchman you also get to skate on the whole “slave trade since time began” thing I call that a win!& this country is built on ""the dream of a good life""!They have one of the best education systems in the word.As Americans we also get to pay for the Dutchman to get universal healthcare excellent roads good public transport and easily accessible high quality Dutch government propaganda.No it’s Israel you’re referring to. In Europe everyone pays taxes and the governments use those taxes to provide healthcare education and infrastructure to the people. You know...the things that taxes are meant to be used for. Not billions of dollars in corporation bailouts and a trillion dollar military. Along with some billions to Israel’s apartheid state.What do you mean?They're also brutally shutting down peaceful protests over the continuing draconian lockdowns... 💁> drsconian l\s\sHaha wappieOn the bright side we don't get to be that smug about it.I mean at least they have something to be smug about. :(Definitely man. The outside world could learn a thing or two about humility from America. You guys are pioneers in that space.We also get endless virtue signaling buffoons that obsess over America and use iPhones and Twitter and reddit to exercise their moral narcissism.Facts.My fellow dutchmen are so self absorbed and arrogant that they don't even know we have had a fully neoliberal government for the past 10-20 years. I can't stress enough how much I hate people like this because the current governing parties are comically incompetent and corrupt(the most recent but not necessarily most notable being the obstruction of our democracy in March-April in which the governing parties colluded to suppress a politician who was critical of the government for illegally denying thousands of people child support and falsely accusing them of fraud) yet somehow consistently win the elections literally just because people don't actually know the politics of their own country.\s\s\- We have universal healthcare but we're the only country in Europe (I think) who don't have FREE healthcare anymore. Our healthcare system is commercialized resulting in doctors being dissuaded from referring patients to specialists or starting treatment plans that are too expensive for health insurance companies. Moreover even if you get treatment that's officially covered under insurance you have to pay the first $300-$900 out of pocket(it depends on your copay) because the government considers it your 'own risk' (Being born with chronic illness is on you Jack). The counter for how much you've spent on treatment covered by insurance resets every year. Of course this is all how it should work theoretically. In practice many of laws are routinely broken without consequence. Moreover our general practitioners are extremely overworked due to heavy savings on healthcare workers.\s\s\- Yes our government loves roads. So much in fact that it perpetually builds more at the expense of biodiversity for no apparent reason.\s\s\- Our public transport is quite good relative to other countries though it could be better if it weren't commercial.\s\s\- Education is fine but disproportionately expensive compared to other European countries. Many students are struggling with student loans especially because housing prices are soaring.\s\sIf you're going to live in Europe and can live without weed you probably shouldn't move to the Netherlands at least now. It's much more a facade of excellence that dutch people love to circlejerk over than anything else. That's why we've had a strongly liberal cabinet for the past 10 years without people even realizing it.Why is that happening?Not to mention that the Netherlands are literally the country with the highest wealth inequality in the world. No kidding. Look it up.This is a good and accurate take.They require immigrants learn Dutch and pass tests within a period of time or be deported.is this like a *learn to speak merican'* comment? really? what does that have to do with anything?Dutch always had it right. Dutch could have stopped Pakistan from going nuclear as Dr. Khan stole the design from URENCO. His coworker complained about it to higher up but he was ignored. They thought it was Americans job to stop spread of nuclear weapons around the world. Johan Cruyff arena in Amsterdam is the greenest football stadium in the world.[deleted]Comments like that aren't meant to make you feel good.

You know people like Joe Biden who wrote the Crime Bill the Bankruptcy Bill and drafted the Patriot Act. When the country moves further right it's because the ""opposition party"" went along with our political enemies and refused to hold the line and obstruct against regressive policies. No one party is responsible for the horrible state of this country right now. This is the result of a bipartisan project more than half a century in the making.Or you know the guy who saw the arsonist then went to help him deserves blame for it too especially if people went on to try to say the person aiding the arsonist is actually a hero. Everyone other then conservatives knows how bad the republicans are but people still treat the democrats like they actually care about stopping anything the republicans do.I blame the fire department who showed up to the burning house too their name too literally and started spraying gasoline on it.I too attack dems more repubs are open about their intentions dems are two-faced which means that more energy has to be spent on them to reveal their true nature dems have successfully fooled many progressives into buying into the “vote the lesser evil just this once” argument I need not waste my energy on republicans beyond “I hate republicans too/this also applies to republicans”I feel like the whole dem voter strategy is literally ""vote for the lesser evil just this once"". Like the main draw to their candidates is ""WELL AT LEAST HE'S NOT THAT GUY"".Something something parahnas....With Republicans you know what the party stands for.

They’re the firefighters telling us they’re gonna stop the arsonists but leaving out free gasoline and matches.They are all in the same tax bracketGreat discussion going on here.\s\sI wish I could contribute but you're all too good.My reason is because I already agree republicans are terrible preaching to the choir rather do something productive with the time I would be wasting complaining about republicans.I've watched leftest fight for Democrats for the last 20 years.  Republicans score victory after victory totally unopposed and overtly assisted by the Democratic Party.  The leftest get stabbed in the back by the Democratic Party at every opportunity.  Yet here we are continuing to play out scorpion and the frog year after year.Wow this was really well saidWe've been saying this for years here.Liberals are the cork in the leftist bottle.Those black bars above and below the image really made me think the reddit app had glitched.The backstabbing is a deliberate part of the strategy. That way liberals can be defensive and say to the left ""You need to grow up and realize that you can't get 100% of what you want"" when Dems fail to fight for anything and ""Dems had to support bad legislation because they don't have the votes"" when Dems capitulate to the Republicans. We've seen it constantly for the last 30 years. These arguments are specifically designed to make the left seem unreasonable while the neolib ""center"" is portrayed as pragmatic. So we get nothing the Republicans get 75% of what they want and billionaires and multinational corporations get 100%. \s\sThe problem with voting for Dems is that they lie and make it seem like they want what you want but when you actually look at their record they are antithetical to a leftist policy agenda and actively work to suppress it. Look at all that bullshit Biden said during the election and compare that to his cabinet appointments and how much he's backtracked on a whole host of issues. He will even refuse to do the things that he doesn't need Congress' help on like reducing student debt which could be done with an executive order. Dems like to spout the line that we need to be satisfied with incremental progress and that change is slow but it's all bullshit designed to placate you and convince you that you shouldn't be demanding more from the government that claims to be on your side.I wish this comment was on the frontpage of political reddit. Encapsulates exactly what I think a lot of us feel.I don't disagree other than the ""what Biden said"" part.  Obama legitimately ran on a ""hope and change"" ""we'll stop the rise of the oceans"" ""everyone benefits when we spread the wealth around"" agenda before doing almost nothing bold or Leftwing as president.  Biden's agenda was largely two things--""Return us to some lesser iteration of Obama ca. 2014"" and ""Not Be Trump.""  There was no way he was ever going to push a spate of systemically significant Leftist policies and he never really gave an impression otherwise.  Like Obama Biden thinks that his Center Right corporate policy IS Progressive and everything to his Left is ""how are we gonna pay for it"" and ""The American People aren't there yet man.""  \s\sThe Left very largely voted for Biden this time full-well knowing that he was the second or third most Rightwing candidate in the Democratic field that he valued working with Republicans as his primary m.o. above any preference for policy.  The Left wasn't duped this time or robbed.  It was either frightened and disgusted by Republican fascism enough to not go scorched-Earth against Biden or it's just too small to be able to win a primary against the entire Establishment at this stage.  Either way it has to massively build and probably change quite a few strategies in order to prepare for 2028 when we'll have an even bigger fight over the future of the country and the planet as now and when the AOC's of the world are now serious contenders.>It's funny to me that democrats didn't do shit to fight the supreme court appointment that they just spent months telling us was the apocalyptic horror we had to prevent by voting for a rapey segregationist  \s>  \s>Also the house majority could have stopped a great many things they just spent months telling us were apocalyptic horrors we had to stop by voting for a rapey segregationist but they didn't  \s>  \s>Literally every reply to these tweets: Liberals to poor people on the internet: you sonofabitch this is all your fucking fault you worthless piece of shit fuck you  Liberals to their elected officials: it's ok baby there's nothing you could have done\s\s[https://twitter.com/jediofgallifrey/status/1320882715202359296](https://twitter.com/jediofgallifrey/status/1320882715202359296)Plus Bernie kept telling us that Trump was a very dangerous president and yet Pelosi didn’t even bother to impeach him for his real crimes.

($4.22USD)That is one of the biggest of all propaganda lies. The price of goods is determined by what the market will bear not some magic multiple of their cost. Since McDonalds can obviously make a satisfactory profit in Denmark it should be even more obvious that the wages they pay in the US being only a fraction of the wages in Denmark are purposely set as low as possible only to maximize profits not because they “have to be”.And they never ask if paying a CEO $3000+ an hour will raise the price of a burger.22/hr in Denmark?

No minimum wage and give the bargaining power to the unions. Across the board minimum wage increase does nothing substantial in improving lives.  Unionize.Why do you believe a minimum wage hike to $15/hr does nothing substantial whereas a union negotiating for $15/hr is different? Isn’t the net result the same?

That's the wrong standard and until it changes we're going to see the slaughter by cops continue.\s\sIf a non-violent suspect is running away cops should not be allowed to draw their guns or even use tasers.  They should have to chase and tackle the suspect to subdue them.  Keep in mind the expression ""innocent until proven guilty"".\s\sCurrent policing is not only racist it's classist as well.\s\sImagine some corporate executive selling dangerous products or cheating on his tax returns and having a cop break into his office with his weapon drawn.  Imagine a cop shooting a white-collar criminal.  I wonder why that never happens.  Never ever.\s\sCops are bullies.  They are people who seek power over others.  They dare you and double dare you to give them an excuse to escalate the situation and they feel so righteous and justified because they hide behind their badges.  Bystander videos and body-worn cameras are showing us the abuse that has been going on for decades.  We're shocked by the daily incidents we're seeing but they are nothing new.\s\sWe're getting lots of coverage about this even in the corporate media.  It's not enough.  The focus is still ""this bad cop or that one.""  What's needed is systemic change to policing.  What's needed is a much more clearly defined standard for when force is appropriate.\s\sThe bottom line is that using a weapon should only be permitted when there is an imminent life-threatening threat to the officer or to the public.  Anything else is police abuse and a violation of a suspect's civil liberties.  Again evading arrest by running away or driving away is not justification for the use of a gun.\s\sThe sooner we demand this as the national standard for the use of force by police the sooner we'll see a reduction in the daily carnage.And people are criticizing an actual child for not “complying correctly”. “He should have verbalized he was throwing the gun etc”. He was a child in fear for his life and the fact that people are analyzing his actions instead of the police officer’s is just disgusting. Apparently only cops panicking and reacting poorly is justified. Give me a fucking break.It was a report from Shootspotter not a report of people being shot at. The cop does a fast waist patdown first on the adult then chases after the other ""suspected armed suspect"" down a dark alley with no cover?\sWas this the only cop on-duty?  No backup to call?  Did he have a hero complex?  \sHe put himself into a no turning back situation and forced himself to make a split-second decision in darkness.  \sA guy named Custer sought his own glory and forced his own poor hand in a no turning back situation.Put simply:\s\sThat's a truth close to poetry.When public policing collapses it is up to the people to police \s\sMeaning we should just shoot ourselves instead of waiting for the cops to do it\s\sJk\s\sForm your own community police[It’s wild out there. ](https://youtu.be/4in8yihefEU)This country can either do some very heavy police reform or expect a very high price from failing to do so.

Hard pass.I think our chances of helping that guy are much higher if we don’t call it “socialism”And yet it is socialism. It's in use all over the world including in the US.\s\sThe only issue with the word 'socialism' is american education. And there are a *lot* of issues that come from american education or lack thereof. Maybe you'd be able to help a lot more people by fixing *that* instead of giving in to the self-censoring game that those assholes want you to waste your time playing.[well you ain't done nothing if you ain't been called a red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Tk9QxvZHo)Change the term and they'll demonize that as well.The problem is thinking taxes will help and not be used to fund pet projects. Taxation isn’t the answer especially with a corrupt government.I think I'd go with the meme.\s\sI believe the argument in opposition boils down to:  The sun hangs in the sky therefore all governance should disproportionately represent the interests of a small number of rich people instead of the interests of poorer people.It isn't the *sole* answer. The corruption issue needs to be fixed obviously but *then* properly taxing the rich and getting back the money they stole from workers is still needed.\s\sYou can't redistribute wealth if you don't take it from where it's been hoarded for all this time. So either taxes or just taking it from their bank accounts I'm at peace with both options.Taxes will help at least as much as insurance :)Billionaires will never be taxed the way you think they should they can hide money too many ways. Changes in taxes will always effect the middle class disproportionately. The question is if they can create money at will why tax anyone at all?There is a lot of room between a healthy group of public programs and government controlling the means of production. \s\sI'd be happy if legislators and executives would permanently extract their fingers from the wallets of the wealthy and keep elections honest.welfare liberalism |=| ""socialism""\s\s""socialism"" is not when gov't does stuff nor ""taxes the rich"" either.That’d be the dayDemocrats most definitely don’t want to stop Manchin Cinnamon or any of the centrist Dems. They take cover in being “blocked” by R majorities. And during the brief interregnums where they don’t have an R majority to block them in their posturing by necessity they must elevate one or two “centrist” Dems to prevent any progress from accidentally being achieved (I am sure they have a deep bench of centrists that would be happy to take on this role). Just the way it is in our system where both parties are owned and operated by the same 20 or 30 plutocrats.Exaxtly. This is part of the core rot that needs to be excised.For the life of me I'll never understand why every just shrugged their shoulders when the DNC rigged the nomination for Hillary and stole it from Bernie.I can understand that part it was confusing and no one was really sure what had actually happen d it's not until the DNC was sued that we got clear evidence that proves it could have been rigged as the DNC argued ""we don't have to hold fair primaries we can nominate whoever we want."" Says it all right there the whole system is broken.The corporate media cut coverage of Bernie off and most voters didn't understand what was happening and the DNC wanted the money Hillary would dispense.  It is largely about power and money and politics attracts those for whom money and power are the sole motivators.That was a conspiracy theory spread online by Russian bots Bernie Bros and nazi Trump supporters.\s\s\sEdit: I can't believe I need to edit in a /sDemocrats want what Joe Manchin wants. They just don't want us to know it.Kinda bold to assume that Democrats want to stop Joe Manchin.Joe Manchin is just doing what Joe Biden really wants.  But the same might be said of Bernie of late.Downvote farmer incoming...\s\sDo people honestly believe Bernie could have achieved more? Does anyone believe Manchin would be more liberal and open to things like killing the filibuster if it were Bernie instead of Biden? Odds are it would have been even harder to get anything done.\s\sThats why this whole focus on Biden/Bernie was always wrong if you want to get stuff done.\s\sManchin is not the problem. He is from freaking West Virginia. Thats Trump country. Odds are no other Dem or leftist would even get 30% there let alone have a chance of winning.\s\sThe huge problem is that Susan freaking Collins won Maine again. Biden vs Bernie or leftist vs establishment is so stupid to me if you are left-leaning in the US.\s\sIf you won't ever get 50+ reliable votes in the Senate you are screwed. Thats what people need to understand. Because then you can either kill of the filibuster or use killing it as a threat to get people to cave. Then you can make DC a state and gain 2 reliable Senators. Maybe even Puerto Rico and shift the balance in the Senate more towards the left (currently its heavily biased towards Rs and thats probably the biggest of all problems that needs to be adressed). If you achieve that leftists can still whine about the establishment Dems.\s\sBut right now they don't even have a real case because the freaking system doesn't even work properly enough to have it become a real issue (again Manchin is behaving like he is because he wants to get re-elected in West freaking Virginia. Nobody would need him if freaking Collins wouldn't have won in Maine for some weird reason AGAIN.)Bernie would've at least forgiven student loans through executive order something that Biden still refuses to do. He also would've signed other executive orders to push for progressive agenda that's completely within his power. \s\sSo yes Bernie could've easily achieved more.Democrats are right wing and LOVE what Manchin is doing.Yes!It's a mistake to assume that Joe Manchin is just one guy. He is only the decoy providing cover for other neoliberals so they don't have to face the heat. Why spoil legislation with 10 nays when 1 will do? Half the party agrees with him that if you improve the lives of Americans too much they won't keep voting Democrat out of desperation. Cut one Manchin off another will rise up (e.g. Sinema). We need a more widespread progressive takeover of the party.Joe Manchin is the only one standing up to mob rule at this point. \s\sThe filibuster is a fairly essential part of the federalist system. But democrats just want to steamroll their opposition which is not very cash money.Giving Democrats any credibility is self defeating.  Dismantle the Democratic Party.Dismantle both corrupt parties. Fuck just abolish government at this point it's demonstrated that we cannot trust people in political power they abuse it for self gain.> Democrats may want to stop Joe Manchin\s\sWhy?  Did Joe Manchin do something bad or wrong?Depends who you ask.I would assume at this point that the dems actually love Joe Manchin. They can use him as their scapegoat.Joe Manchin is one of the only people stopping the abolition of the filibuster lmao. Based DemocratRight? If it weren't for that heroic man Democrats would have to out themselves as being yet another party against the people.Fuck Joe Manchin burn in hell scumAnother Dem would step up and replace him.\s\sHe's the Democratic villain of the day. There are many more like him.I have zero love for Manchin however apparently he's very left of center compared to his constituents in WV.Why would they?\s\sManchin toes the line for them all the time.Exactly Manchin is running interference for the party apparatus.Bingo.That implies they actually want to stop Manchin.\s\sLet's get this straight: Democrats love and support Sinema and Manchin because they are playing the role of the rotating villains beautifully.Baked into this is a fallacy that needs to be destroyed in the hearts and minds of people.  Democrats don’t want to succeed their number one priorities are to fail with plausible deniability drum up campaign funds with next time promises or republican fears and work across isle on pro corporate bills.    \s  \sManchin is the best thing to happen to them.It's professional wrestling and Manchin is just the heel. People need to realize that there's really only one party in this country.I can't believe people still don't see thisWell besides Lieberman Baucus Nelson who played Manchin during Obama and Clinton. Then they lose the midterms on purpose because they failed to help again and then they help republicans pass their bills. Pelosi even gave Trump more power to spy on us. lol he spied on democrats! That’s funny.If Democrats wanted to stop Joe Manchin they could easily do so by withholding party funds and campaigning against him. They don't do that.\s\sThis should tell you that the Democrats are perfectly happy with what Joe Manchin is doing.yup Schumer keeps appointing him to committeesHow would withholding funds hurt Manchin if he's not running for reelection? Schumer had to beg him to run in 2018.And if people actually stopped drinking lattes they'd freak the fuck out. How many people self-medicate with sugar and caffeine to help them ignore the meaninglessness of their day to day lives? Ten million? Twenty million?

Millennials aren’t drinking coffee anymore! How are they getting the energy to make it through their gray meaningless lives?”Why not both? Businesses definitely need to pay a living wage but people should also have basic money management skills.No this is about attempting to blame the individuals for systemic failure by pointing to frivolous spending to avoid talking about the larger issue causing the problem.  If your buying 6-7 coffee cups of coffee a day at 4 dollars a cup.  You got bigger problems than rent.People having basic money management skills is obviously not a bad thing but it's also not an answer to crushing poverty and a base standard of living that is increasingly out of reach.  No individual can buy enough coffees in a year to off-set the fact they will never afford a downpayment on a house or a $10000 emergency room trip.  People are annoyed at being told to be wiser with their money because the problem is they have nothing like enough money and their indulgences are relatively petty.But I don't want to give up my full body latte's.$3 latte for 52x 5x = $780.00.

(Short-term capital gains have been taxed at the same rate as ordinary income for this entire period.)[16] This approach was dropped by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 starting with tax year 2018.[2]\s\s\s\s\shttps://taxfoundation.org/biden-capital-gains-tax-rates/\s\s\sTop Combined Capital Gains Tax Rates Would Average 48 Percent Under Biden’s Tax Plan\sApril 23 2021\s\sPresident Joe Biden’s American Family Plan will likely include a large increase in the top federal tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends from 23.8 percent today to 39.6 percent for higher earners. When including the net investment income tax the top federal rate on capital gains would be 43.4 percent. Rates would be even higher in many U.S. states due to state and local capital gains taxes leading to a combined average rate of 48 percent compared to about 29 percent under current law.Good because most of the income for the ultra rich is capital gains. This is an excellent way to tax billionaires.**[Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States)** \s \s >In the United States of America individuals and corporations pay U.S. federal income tax on the net total of all their capital gains. The tax rate depends on both the investor's tax bracket and the amount of time the investment was held. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the investor's ordinary income tax rate and are defined as investments held for a year or less before being sold. Long-term capital gains on dispositions of assets held for more than one year are taxed at a lower rate.\s \s^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | Credit: kittens_from_space)Fuck Biden.

By the time the hangman's noose went taut it's too late to do anything about it.   The oligarchy offers easy credit to Americans then smash their wages into the dirt to force them to take on horrendous medical student car housing poor decision debt.  As a result 80% of Americans are over leveraged to the tits just to bridge themselves from debt to debts.  The majority of Americans are involuntarily and voluntarily perpetuating their own misery.  If we want a general strike we must buy and retire as much of Americans debts particularly medical debts.Without some multi-bilionaire suddenly switching sides  (and believe me they won't) this will never happen.

Yeah about the last thing on earth I'm in the mood to hear right now.The climate crisis reveals that no politician has ever listened to scientists when the narrative does not support their ends.

You say a business owner should profit from their product/service. No one is arguing against a business owner/ceo/corporation profiting from the service/product they offer especially if it's popular - what IS being argued is that our system allowing so much money to find its way to so few people is a symptom of a broken system. \s\sThe problem ISN'T that a lot of money is going to business owners - the problem IS that it's NOT going to:  \sa. its employees  \sb. taxes that fund the system that corporation is using to provide its service/product like how they use public roads and employ people educated in public schools. \s\sAs one example that Amazon went for so many years without paying ANY taxes is obscene and a symptom of a broken system. And the Bernie/AOC-ers are proposing reforms to the systems that allow this much money to ever make it to these owners but not the people/systems that make those things possible.That would be okay if they paid their share of taxes but they do not>if what your producing selling or creating is worth all the money in the world then you deserve it.\s\sI'm trying to think of what could be so important that the person who produces and sells it deserves to have 100% of the world's riches (in which case everyone else has 0%).\s\s🤔 I'm not coming up with anything.

Its like the 1% will allow you to say all the progressive shit you guys wantso long as nothing of value is done about it.Both are controlled oppositionsAOC always had ""nice words"". For example check out [her first interview with Jimmy Dore from about a year before she won her election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl5mpr7hUwc) and the establishment co-opted her.

Money can buy excellent PR.\s\sBillionaires are literally a threat to life on the planet.Gates is not a eugenicist. The reason the world's poorest people have so many kids is simply because of the sky-high infant mortality rate.

Both says = kerching!“Liberal democracies” stage eternal duels and offer voting as a pacifying ritual every four years or so: Democrats vs. Republicans Liberals vs. Conservatives Labour vs. Tories etc. Every election is the most important election. Figureheads and partisan pundits are always “tearing each other apart” publicly in elaborate and spectacular kayfabe full of scandalous barbs that make their way to the front pages. And then in the evening those same rivals go on have drinks together send their kids to the same private schools and “put aside their differences” for important transcendental matters such as war (for) and the environment (against). [[10](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/01/the-curse-of-bipartisanship)]\s\sThe result of this grim state of affairs is that the oppressed classes understandably become deeply cynical about the entire notion of “politics.” Or to put it in terms of political tendency regardless of who they vote for at the booth they begin to become dyed-in-the-wool *Libertarians*; “incompetence of government” becomes their main transcendental political truth. This becomes especially apparent when they discuss the choking and overthrow of the government of *other* peoples in Venezuela and Syria and Korea. Normally disillusionment with one’s government would lead to demands for *better* government or *different* government but Westerners are so ingrained with the idea that theirs is the *best* government that instead they reject the very idea of good governance altogether. And so the masses learn to passively embrace the encroachment of private corporations over all aspects of the economy and indeed life in general. \s\sThe concept of *brainwashing* was invented— by a CIA agent posing as a journalist— precisely because Westerners needed a way to reflexively dismiss the phenomenon whereby their own troops were being persuaded of communist ideas during communist captivity:\s\s>The idea of “brain-washing” can be credited to Edward Hunter a CIA-funded writer and editor who in 1950 started writing articles and books on the subject. His thesis was that Red China and the Soviet Union could control the minds of their respective citizenry— which explained how susceptible Americans captured on foreign soil would be. [[11](https://daily.jstor.org/brainwashing-history/)]\s\sThis new category supposedly qualitatively different from normal ideology acquisition itself turns out to be simply an ideological distinction without a difference.\s\sEvo Morales a man accused of “dictatorship” for repeatedly winning popular elections summarized it well in 2019 after his party was temporarily ousted from power in a US-backed coup:\s\s>As far as I can tell American democracy deceives its people into voting but neither the government nor the people actually govern. It’s the transnational corporations who govern. [[12](https://mobile.twitter.com/theintercept/status/1206308962234224646)]\s\sV. I. Lenin agrees in 1912:\s\s>Since the emancipation of the Negroes the distinction between the two parties has been diminishing. The fight between these two parties has been mainly over the height of customs duties. Their fight *has not had* any *serious* importance for the mass of the people. The people have been deceived and diverted from their vital interests by means of spectacular and meaningless *duels* between the two bourgeois parties. [[13](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1912/nov/09.htm)]\s\sAlso in agreement from the opposite side of class struggle is Grover Norquist a powerful Bush-era republican known for his “Americans for Tax Reform” project in 2001:\s\s>I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub. [[14](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1123439)]\s\sThough he is a sworn reactionary Norquist rejects the notion of abolishment. He simply wants to ensure that elections have no ability whatsoever to impose any restrictions on his bourgeois dictatorship. German Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble advocate of austerity policy in Europe was less crass yet no less succint in 2015:\s\s>Elections cannot be allowed to change economic policy. [[15](https://redsails.org/brainwashing/#fn:Sch%C3%A4uble)]\s\sShielding capitalist interests from “tyrannical majorities” has always been a core value of liberalism finding full apogee in the bourgeois revolutions in France and America. [[16](https://redsails.org/brainwashing/#fn:Losurdo)] The only exception to this overt expression of power occurred partly during the post-war international class struggle known as the “Cold War.” The rise of the Soviet Union led to some tactical concessions on part of the Western bourgeoisie which infused the working classes with illusions about the welfare state which made them particularly vulnerable to endless propaganda denigrating all socialist revolutions as “degenerated” or “authoritarian.” The fall of the Soviet Union naturally led to the clawback of those original welfarist concessions. By this time however having absorbed all of that propaganda so unquestioningly Western workers simply couldn’t entertain the idea of socialist statehood (with all of its trade-offs and complexities) which inevitably led to total historical nihilism and a complete inability to organize towards socialism.\s\sIt’s clear that the main targets of US propaganda are its workers and those of its vassal states all of whom continue to wallow in the darkness of despair the light at the end of the tunnel fully blotted out. Therefore undoing this *brainwashing* is a principal task of the revolution.\s\s---\s\sadapted from https://redsails.org/brainwashing/did you post this up as its' own post?\s\sbecause it needs discussion.\s\si mean yes...it is pretty obvious that if they can't get you to join them in the superbowl political arena to pick a side they'd rather you cynic out and let them do what they were doing anyway--pretending to drown the ""gov't"" in a bathtub while using it as an instrument of oppression against us.\s\sbut what aside from full on mass general strikes and revolution neither of which anyone wants to even countenance much less try to arrange is the solution?\s\sit's a quandary i've been in for some time now.You should not waste your time typing that long responses.

Expecting millions of people living in vast slums with a considerable organized crime element to conform to american ideals is arrogant stupid and unrealistic and borne of pride poor education and lack of understanding of the rest of the planet.Correct the US makes up for 15% of carbon emissions we need to figure out how to pull it out of the air at a resonable cost otherwise we’re just wasting our time.What if we bought the man an electric bike?If customers start to put their money in companies that help save the planet instead of just making a profit it will work.If those companies are more expensive then that is also not going to work as many people are just struggling to get by and can't afford to pay more.That is some Victim blaming if ever id heard itThe neoliberal solution is to co-opt the climate change movement to lobby for solutions that aren't harming capitalism on the contrary it's benefitting it while pretending to be noble and ""activist"" because they're not denying climate change.\s\sThe Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement were a sham what we need is to tackle overpopulation and consumerism but this will never happen because capitalism is based on growth including population one it can literally not exist without growth. So the human race will continue to be delusional and irresponsible until overpopulation will be ""tackled"" on its own through death famine and destruction. The rich fucks don't care though they're already buying New Zealand.They are working on the ""overpopulation"" part as we speak. It's quite terrifyingBased and insightpilledOverpopulation isn’t so much a problem it’s more about distribution of resources>U.S. climate envoy John Kerry on Tuesday said he believed the private sector was more likely to find solutions to climate change than government.\s\s>“I was convinced and I remain convinced no government is going to solve this problem” Kerry said in remarks at the Institute of International Finance’s 2021 Washington Policy Summit.\s\shttps://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/545125-kerry-no-government-is-going-to-solve-climate-change\s\sUh yeah real genius Kerry just like the MIC is going to end the endless wars.\s\sWhat a dumb fucker.That's why people like Kerry need to get the fuck out of public ""service"" so they can at long last be replaced.The private sector responding to capitalism is the reason that coal plants are shutting down all over the US--the total capacity from coal has been halved in the last decade.\s\sI'm not saying that the government shouldn't make certain moves to reduce carbon emissions because it absolutely should.  But to pretend that the private sector hasn't already responded to outside forces to reduce its independence on coal as one example is ignoring the reality on the ground.You don’t get it and your point about the MIC proves Kerry is correct the MIC is a business and their incentivizes are money in order to make money they need to produce state of the art planes/bombs/guns etc what would happen to their government contracts if they were unable to deliver the goods? They’d be given to someone else. If the governement was to offer say a nuclear power plant company with a government contract to build the latest carbon free nuclear power plant they would also need to deliver on the goods. \s\sAnd yes the MIC needs wars to survive but the energy sector doesn’t need climate change all they need are houses and businesses that need power because thats where the money is. \s\sThinking governments are able to solve these problems   when we all know politians only care about clout and lining their own pockets.They could figure out how to endlessly profit off the destruction of the planet but couldn't find a way to profit off saving it and thus themselves. Ironic.It wasn’t always a contest. \s\sGovernment and companies are supposed to complement and grow *together*. That’s how it was pre-1964.It always was profitable for governments but only in the long run.USA consumers consume  more stuff than Europe and china combine to fight climate change they need do something about this.As of the present the neo-lib establishment is the driving political force behind the 'fight climate change' agenda.And the ""fight climate change"" agenda they're pushing is ""do essentially nothing and hope it becomes profitable to fight climate change""Except for the part where they're all bought out by big oil and they're giving huge subsidies to fossil fuel companies.This is wrong in so many ways. Neoliberals aren't hoping sustainable energy sources will be profitable because they already *are* more profitable than fossil fuels. What they're doing is 'hoping' companies will invest in renewable energy and move away from fossil fuels.\s\sThe problem is that the market strategy is too slow because fossil fuel companies don't have incentive to transition to sustainable energy as quickly as they need to if they're guaranteed to have the largest share in the sustainable energy sector once they do anyway. From a business perspective it just makes more sense to sell both instead of one or the other.Isn't the definition of Neoliberal mean RepublicanThe worst part is they don’t even hope they literally don’t care and tell us to hopeThat’s not true the neoliberal solution is a carbon tax.\s\sIf you raise it high enough there won’t be enough money in the world to pay for harmful levels of emissions rendering all unsustainable businesses bankrupt>rendering all unsustainable businesses bankrupt\s\sbut there's that special word that's used as a wild card called ......""BAILOUT""Yup but the government should be funding/subsidizing nuclear and green energy in areas where coal plants are situated as well that way when a carbon tax is applied peoples power bills won’t go through the roof.Agreed.carbon taxes like most taxes fall on US.\s\sso we are going in hock for them.\s\swe need actual set limits and genuine strategies for reaching them not ""invisible hands"" of the market.sorry but it will work.\s\swhy?  follow what just happened with the Covid ""vaccines"" to find out.\s\sthey have been working THAT plan for 20+ years.  they already know how they're going to make money off of it.  the problem as in most things is making us at least compliant if not outright begging Elon to make all of us slaves so he can ""save"" us with ""his"" solar/cars/satellites.\s\sthe question remains whether this will actually do anything for the environment or not but we will all believe it will much like we believe suddenly that kids aren't in cages or that ""racism is over"" or whatever BidenTime has been put in there to sell us.\s\s((btw Elon is a cover story.  much like HOward Hughes was back in the day))The habitability of Earth for humans is a lost cause at this point.\s\sAs we die out at least the neoliberals can state around blankly and say who knew this would happen?\s\sWe fucking knew and Bernie would have been a real attempt at fighting that battle.\s\sBut at least the kids are still in cages...I can't fathom why there is a need for signs like this but I'm guessing it's something an American would get. What the sign is suggesting is pretty damn common here anytime a homeless tent is set up people can always be seen dropping off warm drinks food blankets etc. What the hell are y'all doing to your homeless peeps?I don’t know where you are from but in the US there are now so many homeless people that it’s not one or a few tents.There are so many that they've become 'tent cities' on every available public space. In Chicago (very harsh winters!! ) there is a large tent city on the public land adjacent to a freeway ( expressway ) and also underneath the expressways themselves because the overpasses and bridges provides some protection from rain and snow. The problem is endemic.\s \sWe are the “wealthiest nation” on earth!! Yippee! Yes homelessness in the “wealthiest nation on earth” which spends more on it’s war machine than the next 16 nations *combined*! The “wealthiest nation” on earth has infinite money for it's warmongering but never enough money to assist it’s own citizenry. We the “wealthiest nation” on earth are much too busy making citizens of other nations homeless to help our own. ""American exceptionalism” at it’s finest.So a wealth tax would be taxing unrealized gains now?that wasn't even a good tryThis tweet isn't for people that understand how stocks work.Hey folks stop ordering crap from amazon.  Pass it on.I'm waaaaay ahead of you there : )And... not only would THEY then get massively capital gains or income taxed and half of that vanishes into govt coffers immediately-\s\sBut the jobs disappear permanently!\s\sYep because you forced liquidation of the primary nestegg/asset of the corporation itself not just Bezos when wealth taxation is on the market value of all stock issued not at it's personal sale.\s\sDid I mention the stock price will crash too- so most peeps would actually realize less than 10% of that 100k in the fallout?\s\sOh and that it would probably destroy numerous retirement funds in the WS chaos? So moving in with older family won't save these suddenly unemployed Amazon workers either...1. They get taxed about 30% and everyone would receive 70k that's a lot of money\s1a) Tax doesn't vanish.  Taxes are used to fund public services especially at the local level.\s\s2. Amazon employees work to fulfill various roles at Amazon related to operations.  This does not change when stocks are traded on the open market.  Stock value does not affect the operations or the income of the company. It's the other way around.\s\s3. The tweet clearly states Bezos not Amazon issuing new stock.  If it was new shares it would devalue the current shares by 5% to keep the same valuation.\s\s4. Bezos also has assets not associated with Amazon.  The tweet does not specify where the cash comes from. Private owners selling 5% of the company to other private owners doesn't affect much anyway.  Remember that anytime someone is selling another person is buying.  It doesn't just disappear.\s\s5. There won't be any WS chaos.  Large transactions are made all the time on Wall Street. Travis Kalanick sold his entire 5% stock share in December of last year.  It didn't crash the stock in fact Uber went up in December.  Neither would Bezos selling 5%.  Jeff Bezos is selling all of his stock anyway.  He regularly sells 1000000 shares at a time.  He did so again in August. The stock went up anyway.  Your fears are unfounded.\s\sPS: If you're still worried about it then read the tweet again. He's not actually advocating for Bezos to sell his shares and pay his employees.  He's advocating for a wealth tax. He's advocating for a more egalitarian society.  Do you know who would benefit from that?  You would.*pops Raytheon made camo party-popper that sadly farts out a poof of camo confetti*\s\sYaaaaay! $18000 well spent.Better than having trump though right guys?!Yes it still is. Trump is and would be as corrupt as any politician in office. We’d have an infrastructure package that is full of corporate giveaways like selling valuable assets to pay for it and I’m sure it would include the same or bigger tax cuts for the wealthy except in this case his supporters would blinding support it and dismiss anyone that doesn’t like it as antifa.Yes yes it is.

I don't know who's side she's on.Did she not buck Pelosi's status quo when she fought her on the stimulus bill? I don't know why she hasn't endorsed Shahid (is she the only one who hasn't?) but I don't assume she has any love for Pelosi not after the comments Pelosi has made towards her the squad and the progressive left.Reminder: https://www.nationalreview.com/news/it-was-like-pulling-teeth-aoc-backed-away-from-sanders-campaign-after-joe-rogan-endorsement/ \s\s-=-FAKE PROGRESSIVE-=-It's not even ""capitalist healthcare"" it's health insurance as a concept.  The whole concept of insurance is that an insurance company is betting that most of their customers won't use it all the time.. like car insurance.  Health insurance just can't work if everyone needs to go see a doctor.  Back when people only saw doctors when something serious was going on or twice a year checkups and only really sick people got prescriptions.. health insurance was feasible.  If we want everyone to be healthy and have all of the ailments looked at by experts we need a new system.Yes. It gets worse though; people having insurance allow hospitals to charge more than most people would be willing to pay without insurance. So now if you don't have it you pay ridiculous prices almost nobody can afford. Applies to medications too. \s\s\sIt takes a supply vs demand curve used to set prices and completely jacks it up in this way. Insurance companies are great with it because it makes them necessary while they also have an excuse to charge more.And scumbag Biden is overtly against Medicare for All yet AOC endorses him.\s\sAOC is fake.Bernie endorsed him too even though Bernie obviously supports Medicare for All while Biden doesn't. I'm voting green anyway because fuck Biden and the DNC but if you're calling AOC fake for her endorsement than Bernie is too.So did Cornell west.. you mean to tell me he's fake to?Not saying Biden will make things better. I agree a Biden type isn’t in anyway inspirational\s\sMy fear is that Trump will make tho he worseWhy give consent to either? Pull lever A thousands continue to die but (supposedly) ""it doesn't get worse."" Pull lever B thousands keep dying and (supposedly) ""it will get worse."" How do you justify doing either as a moral person? Is there a policy limit or death count before you'll reject the choice as inhumane nonrepresentative and sociopathic?  \s\sThe 1% duopoly is holding us hostage. Vote Green wake your friends and organize mass protests. Anything else at this point is culpability.""Moderates"" (they're neo-conservatives at this point let's face it) are all about being ""inclusive"" as was the argument Pete Buttibot made for his billionaire wine donors while shouting down Bernie in the debates.\s\sDems never were for the people just for profits. Never Biden Harris Butti or any of their ilk.I can see how people can call her radical or can disagree with what she says. \s\sBut I have yet to come across one single argument against this rhetoric that makes ANY sense. Like? ""BUT THEY NEED 18 NUMBERS IN THEIR ACCOUNT. IT FEEDS THEM. IT GIVES THEM ENERGY."" ?? Like. I really don't get how anybody could be against reducing the copious amounts of money healthcare providers make in America.Then AOC should have actually campaigned for Bernie instead of going into the shadows when it mattered most.I don't think that's fair at all. She literally endorsed him right after he had a heart attack. If that wasn't solidarity when Sanders needed it then I don't know what is.>AOC: Over 100000 Americans are dead and Congress won’t extend Medicare to the unemployed bc it’s too busy protecting a corporate system that makes pandemics insanely profitable for Wall St. ANd I refused to support senator BERNIE R. SANDERS BECAUSE A PODCAST HOST ENDORSED HIM!!!! \s\s#\#FUCK A O C !!And yet when you bring this issue up and mention the fact that Biden steadfastly refuses to support medicare for all you get accused of being a Trump supporter. The Democrats consistently fight against real healthcare reform then offer up what is essentially the moderate Republican approach to healthcare namely a mandate to buy insurance.Biden is horrible. But Trump is worse. What are the real choices? To me its getting Biden in and then supporting down ballot progressives in their primaries. I think the time. To bash Biden is immediately after the election. Then we go hard. I think we need to get rid of the worst thing first.This should have being in the first bill but like always dem play good cop bad cop give republicans everything in the first bill then later help the working class why would republicans do anything if they got 100% what they wanted in the first bill Obama played same game when he was in office to this day people still thing he was progressiveGreat message.\s\sNow bigoted SJW wokescolding and/or unforced praise and support for an establishment shitbag in 4 3 2...And this is why the Democratic Party spends so much money AGAINST Progressive candidates.It should also be pointed out that this is what people can expect from any effort at privatization which is being pushed hard by 'rump & pals. Privatization results in a loss of accountability transparency and control.[deleted]>she is not perfect but wonderful in many ways\s\sShe isn't wonderful in any meaningful way. All hat no cattle.So let's do something about this? Are we done crying online yet? Let's take these fuckers down.This woman literally supports the book ""White Fragility"" lol.   And why should only the unemployed get Medicare?  She's changing her terms because she backs the far-right rapist Biden.this comment is the definition of ""bad faith""The People: ""We need M4A!!""\s\sDems and corporations: ""Wear a mask.""\s\sThe People: ""Okay.""Medicare for All won’t save you from coronavirus.  You get put on a vent you will still have the same chance of dying whether you get off it with a $1 million hospital bill or not.  Wearing a mask however is something you can do to not die.What does she say about the $7 trillion that Pelosi and House Dems like herself gave to the billionaires?\s\sI mean wtf? How can she spew this bullshit but not condemn her own party? AOC is part of the problem. She is seamlessly moving into Bernie's position of marginalized progressive who gets nothing done but whose false outrage camouflages the Dem establishment's right-wingery.So granting that everything the comic says (or implies) about the inequities of capitalism is true what are the options?\s\sOn the one hand I guess you could try to concurrently acquire a supermajority in both houses of congress as well as the presidency composed of true progressives but well... America's system of government was more or less designed to prevent that from happening-- elitism isn't a bug; it's a feature!  And never more so than the era of Citizens United!\s\sWhich leaves... violent revolution I guess?  How will *that* work?\s\sI mean I'm *totally down* for taking most of the DOD budget and fixing all of America's socioeconomic problems but I have no idea how you get there and I don't think voting for Bernie Sanders Howie Hawkins or whoever every four years is going to do it.And probably the only reason many are noticing is because of the the absence of sports.Even though I'm a mild fan of a few sports I've always thought Chomsky was on to something when he critiqued sports as a means of distracting the populace right down to funneling an average person's capacity for deep uncensored analysis into the politics and economics of sports rather than the politics and economics of society. An average dude can call in to a sports talk station and argue intelligently with an authoritative analyst; he can't do the same (outside of CSPAN) with a congressman or the mayor. \s\sPro sports are not just a distraction they're like a safety valve for dissenting thought processes among the lower classes. Like the lottery for the proles in Orwell's *1984*.Opiate of the masses.Mother Fucking Bread and Circus!!!

I finally get ahead of the curve only for the whole game to change.Pay for what?😂😂😂😂😂 no.> 'Self Made' is a myth\s\sIt's not but whatever floats your boat.I don't agree with the Bezos one. It's never been easier to get funding for a good business idea (where like or dislike their current business model there's no denying the initial project was an innovative good idea) even if you're a minority or from a poorer background.Imagine thinking 300k is a lot for an investment after you have an established business.  Imagine just labeling someone the owner of an emerald mine without and value attached. \s\sThese guys are all smart and driven. Plenty of people in this world have much more money when young and produce nothingIn personal finance a very common saying is “Just get to your first million however you can the first million is the hardest” and it’s true. After the first million you have enough money to take risks with still expect growth AND not worry about losing it.there are just enough of the ""self made"" out there to make this sound plausible.  i also believe people are carefully chosen from the underclass to move up to make it seem more possible than it is while reinvigorating the Owning class with fresh blood & new ideas.\s\soften though you find that those people had smarts and quite a few lucky breaks to utilize them within.And this even leaves out how Gates was privileged enough to go to a school where he was allowed to do what he wanted.

I have never heard these people referred to as self made.Obviously growing up being son to an emerald mine owner would’ve made for a comfortable childhood but did Musk’s father ever contribute to financially or otherwise his sons business starts ups (PayPal etc)?

You never have to worry about getting in trouble a wire of cash is never more than a phone call away.   If your parents don't know the right ""elite"" to call to get you into a good school or get a business contract or what have you one of their friends do.  If that friend doesn't they know another guy who does.   \s\s""Networking"" is a manta they teach in business school.  It basically means get in good with someone wealthy or as close to it as you can.  When you're born upperclass you don't have to network you inherit the network.   All you have to do is *not* be a complete prick to those involved and you're golden.  Their networks extend far further than yours do.  3 or 4 degrees of separation for them is the same as your inner circle.\s\sNot everything is about checks with lots of zeros.

This person has an alternative opinion that is actually 100% accurateIf you had insurance it should have been no more than about $15k out of pocket.

Bad faith neoliberals will argue this or that progressive policy isn't popular (when they aren't smearing progressive activists/commentators/journalists) and doesn't have support well perhaps if you were honest with the public about these things it would have more support but it doesn't because you don't because they do NOT want this policy and they will do whatever to control the narrative and uphold the status quo and that includes but not limited to gaslighting and brainwashing.

It is typical of a portion of the population contaminated with such a failed geometry to embrace what they have been told is an acceptable alternative; eco-socialism which is a derivative of the failed British System.

The entire strategy was to keep bernie from being able to speak at the debates.Tulsi took down Kamala and tried to take down Pete and Warren. She defended Bernie when he was accused of sexism by Warren. And rumor is that she might have not endorsed Bernie simply because Bernie's campaign didn't want to be associated with Tulsi.  (I think the rumor was started by Tulsi's brother but Tulsi won't comment on it as it's private.)Say what? Bernie Tulsi Yang and Willianson were shafted in regards to the debate questions and speaking times. Tulsi was kept out of the 3rd debate after calling out Kamala hard during the 2nd. Gravel was kept out of the first debate. It wasn't* just Bernie that was getting screwed and Warren was the only progressive candidate who was propped up and used/manipulated to hurt Bernie. Not that Beto and Booker and Pete and Harris weren't meant to do the same but not progressives. Liberal in name but what does that even mean? Not left as it would suggest but closer to the corporate center.I've heard a lot of criticism of Tulsi Gabbard but this is the first time I've seen her called a stooge for the Dem establishment.

I'm gonna make it RAIN on whoever it is!You could help Texas in the meantime :) \s\sAlmost everyone I knew was going to vote for Bernie including myself I don't know anyone who wanted Biden. Anyway we need Medicare for all and RCV in Texas and I need support to get us there.You want to replace Warren who's far more progressive than biden.\s\sYou people are fucking morons.loooooool you guys STILL think your candidate lost because of foul play? you DO realize thats the same shit as mr orange apeman Trump himself shouting ""stolen election"" just from the left right?You DO realize the DNC argued in court that as a private entity they are allowed to choose who their nominee will be.You DO realize the recent court ruling admitted the DNC fucked Bernie over but it was OK because they never said they wouldn't fuck him over...additionally Warren started that BS about Bernie saying a woman couldn't be president. She's a pos.You do realize we went through this shit in 2016 and the DNC admitted to it right? Then the courts ruled in favor of the oligarchs anyway. Any of this ringing a bell or do you just prefer to chime in without an informed opinion?STFU with your simple minded logic. There's plenty of evidence to prove the coordinated attack on Bernie campaign by establishment. That's exactly opposite of what Trump did. People like Trump have bastardized legitimate criticisms of establishment and now liberal idiots like you can't see the difference between legitimate criticisms and conspiracy theories.“Foul play”. \sUm no. \s\sWhat Warren did was perfectly legal.

Take off the tinfoil\s\sEdit: as someone who has watched Warren’s career for 15+ years and the rhetoric between her and Sanders this is laughable. I campaigned for Bernie but this is laughable. Cry away.\s\s2nd edit: man the toxicity of the hyper left is just as venomous as the far right. The fact that y'all can't see that is incredibly worrisome.Yang admitted Right after he dropped out Biden agreed to offer him a position in his cabinet.\s\sHe bought the nom by promising these idiots positionsIf not true why didn’t she drop out when she had no clear chance of winning and endorse the only other progressive (as she calls herself) in the race? It’s not that ridiculous to think that there was some sort of coordinated everyone drop out and endorse biden plan before Super Tuesday... because that’s what happened. Perhaps she was thinking of her big future appealing to rich white faux progressives as to not actually endorse biden but she sure as hell didn’t do anything to help the progressive agenda or candidate. But ppl were mean to her on the internet 🐍🐍This guy gets it🐍Forever fuck Elizabeth Warren.Maybe she still thought she could win.So your argument is she's stupid.Maybe she is just a phony.That would indicate she's either really stupid or insane🐍 gonna 🐍Yup and Pete stayed in the race to hurt Bernie in exchange for a cabinet position. Legal in the system but deeply undemocraticI'd thought it was Pete dropping out that hurt Bernie more. Despite all that fuckery in Iowa with the app and shadow inc. Pete claimed he won and the media mentioned it enough times until people believed it. So the ""winner"" or at least 2nd place finisher in Iowa dropping out before Super Tuesday seemed sketch.\s\sHe had the funds to at least make it to ST and he'd had more success than Warren. Doesn't really make sense that he drops prior to ST unless a deal is struck with Biden using Obama as a facilitator. Klob also drops despite her home state voting on ST and despite her also having more success than Warren. \s\sPete and Klob drop before ST so the moderate establishment Reagan Democrats coalesce around Joe. Moreover Warren remains despite having less of a chance than Pete or Klob but she splits the ""progressive"" votes while the conservative Dems endorse Biden.It really was bizarre that Warren didn’t endorse Bernie... at ANY point.\s\sHowever to be fair Bernie shares part of that blame for not playing the game and reaching out.  He should have offered her some kind of power share commitmentShe really really was pissed off with his campaign and the amount of supporters questioning her/drawing attention to her faults. She took it as some personal vendetta obviously. She’s always cared about herself more than anything.It is such a blessing that Bernie wasn’t elected President. I wouldn’t wish this presidency on anyone especially not Bernie. Biden got the shaft— sure he gets to be the “star of the show” right now; meanwhile Bernie is free to do what he does best: Work for the American People! He gets to serve as a trusted advisor to the administration making the changes we need; meanwhile if anything goes wrong it’s on Biden. Bernie can peace whenever he wants too. I’m happy for that.Fuck TYT for propping up Warren to their semi progressive liberal base. That plus villifying Bernie's legit allies (Tulsi and Yang) spelled disaster for the progressive movement.So much this.\s\sThere’s a lot to like about Ana Kasparian but every time she went after Yang’s UBI for not supporting people in expensive states/areas (e.g. NYC San Francisco) proportionally as well as cheaper areas (e.g. rural Kansas) I wanted to scream into a pillow.\s\s*IT’S A FEATURE NOT A FLAW. MEANT TO MITIGATE THE BRAIN DRAIN OF MIDDLE AMERICA TO THE BIG CITIES!*I’m sorry but Tulsi has turned out to be anything but an ally. I have never been so disappointed in a candidate in my entire life. Her pandering to Tucker Carlson’s base and his non sense says it all.her role was also to stick the knife in with that misogynist smear. 🐍  🐍  🐍  🐍  🐍I remember seeing prominent progressives that I followed and liked argue that saying this was misogyny as super tuesday was unfolding lolI would think admitting a woman can be just as corrupt and shitty as a man would be considered feminist.I don’t care if they call me a misogynist because no one who is on my side will care about their bullshit name calling. And anyone who does care? Shows me their ass.At the end of the day she’s just a neoliberal.""I'm a capitalist to my bones"" is all anyone should have needed to hear from her.\s\sbut the idpol libs loved her -- and she helped me understand how misogynistic I am for caring that everybody gets healthcare more than wanting a woman president.I’ll never not be salty about this.A year ago:\s\shttps://twitter.com/scottheins/status/1356954042363166720They have been fucking Bernie over for years.  They'll do it to AOC next.She did it to Bernie too! Don't you remember when she headlined a rally in Iowa and she failed to mention Bernie Sanders at all. And for AOC getting the Bernie treatment lately she's doing it to herself.They already are. They have convinced AOC that to get the ""policies"" done you have to get the ""power"" first. Now she's playing buddy-buddy with her ideological nemesis Nancy Pelosi. That's how they start and get the newcomers stuck in a rat race of gaining and maintaining power while forgetting about policies.Don't bet on that one.Good. We don’t need a hyperpartisan progressive Executive. Change my view.Warren's assigned role on ST was to lose by more than she was projected to. the same as was Bloomberg's role. That's what gave cover to the sudden inexplicable rise of Biden. That + Amy and Pete withdrawing the weekend before to give the appearance of ""consolidating the center"".\s\sI say that because my analysis showed a clear and present pattern of Bloomberg and Warren each losing about 1/3 to 1/2 of the votes projected in the poll the night before ST. In just about every single state. That while Biden won those votes so lost and Bernie gaining nothing from Warren's ""shifty"" would-be voters. \s\sThe algorithm for vote flipping was likely in place for at least a couple of weeks with the final numbers awaiting that night-before poll. I said before that I believe Bernie himself was likely notified that he ain't gonna be allowed to be the candidate the weekend before ST. When did Warren know what her assigned role was? probably earlier - perhaps just past NH.\s\sNo need to ask about Bloomberg - he was part of the play all along - from the get go. The money he spent was a smokescreen to help buy cover for the DNC. He IS one of the insider power players so he knew what needed to be done and why (make sure Bernie loses more or less credibly). How he gets compensated in due course is not for us to ask because we may never know. mafiosi get rewarded for loyalty - that's all we need to know.\s\sHow will Warren be compensated? that we have yet to find out but snakes be snakes she knows she'll be - in due course.Excellent comment. I’ll add why is it so weird to believe that democrats MIGHT have stolen the election from Trump? They already showed the world that they have no problem rigging their primaries.

Not really sure how to get them to see that right is not the answer to these problems.I always hope that the incoming President will do something good even if I don’t like him and didn’t vote for him.  “Draining the swamp” didn’t seem like a bad idea but Trump went right to the swamp for his administration.I don’t understand how people think this. Yeah Trump made a lot of good points in 2016 during his campaign but obviously he was not going to do what he said. Then he spent 4 years doing the bidding of big corporations while following through on 0 of his drain the swamp promises and all his supporters refused to recognize it.In 2016 one of my close friends told me he would either vote for trump or Bernie.

The GOP and the Republican Party writ large mostly pander to white male evangelicals. The GOP (""the GOP’s congressional representatives in Congress (both House and Senate) are 95 percent white"") and the Republican Party writ large (""Republicans are predominantly white with 87 percent of them identifying as non-Hispanic white"") are both *overwhelmingly* white.I'm glad to hear any and all criticism of Biden's cabinet picks and she brings up some really valid criticism. But I'm sick of all this outrage at other people's outrage or at their perceived approval or whatever it is. Like this seems to be engaging in its own kind of identity politics. Diversity is important. Representation is important. Policies are also important; in fact they're more important but it is not an either/or kind of situation.\s\sJust criticize the people he's picking based on their real faults which are many. What is gained by saying these people are bad but some perceived liberals are applauding them because of diversity? Feels like a different form of ""owning the libs"" which I don't find useful and I start to tune it out.It’s pointing out that fawning coverage that only focuses on diversity is a cover story for the fact that these people suck and only represent the establishment.She lists numerous real examples of why the picks are bad.> Just criticize the people he's picking based on their real faults which are many.\s\sShe does exactly that. Instead of engaging in exactly the disingenuous tactic called out in the video maybe you should actually watch it.This is what I tell everyone in my life. Of course I would be overjoyed if a great politician working for the working class was a minority or LGBT member but I d take the most generic pro working class white guy over the most diverse sell out anytime anywhere.Well then you're racist. And transphobic.As do most brown folks actually.I agree 💯""Buzz your girlfriend woof""Congratulations. You have a brain.That's the truth.  \s\sI'm going to go see if she got clobbered in the comments.\s\sEdit-- no she didn't!  Nice.The checks stopped coming for the shillbot hoards.Liberal identity politics promotes people if they will preserve the hierarchies of class race gender etc.  So if it promotes people of marginalized identities it is very selectively and conditionally and basically contingent upon *opposing* the interests of the marginalized identities they share.\s\sLeftist intersectional identity politics promotes people of marginalized identities *because (and when) they look out for the interests of those marginalized identities they share*.\s\sThose philosophies are almost in direct opposition to one another even on this front of supposed ""social liberalism"".[removed]> Liberal identity politics promotes people if they will preserve the hierarchies of class race gender etc.\s\sNot at all.   The people at the top only care about one hierarchy and that is class.   That is why in the UK a recent equality report that ""poor white boys"" now get the ""worst start in life.""   So white males simultaneously occupy the highest and lowest rungs of society in the UK.   If intersectional theory were remotely accurate then (a) this never would have happened and (b) there would be massive campaigns to help white males.   \s\sSimilarly males literally have less rights than females they suffer discrimination in most major institutions (including the education system and the criminal justice system) but there are no departments in government designed to correct these imbalances; instead all gender departments focus almost exclusively on women and girls.   \s\sSo intersectional theory is just objectively wrong.  \s\sWhy is it so popular?  It's popular because elites promote it.   The majority of rich white males don't give a shit about race or sex except insofar as it can be used as a divide and conquer strategy and the same is true of rich non-white-males.   Intersectionality thus serves the same function as old-school racism/sexism they just switched the scapegoats and slapped a ""progressive"" label on it.    \s\sAdditionally an entire professional class has grown up around these issues.   They earn their living by promoting hatred and discrimination against white males just as certain figures on the right earn their living from promoting hatred and discrimination against Muslims Mexicans etc.   \s\sThe only path forward for the left is to abandon identity politics (at least in most forms and most of its current incarnations) and return to a class-based approach.   This is also the only way of helping the vast majority of what you call ""marginalized identities.""   Universalist solutions rooted in class solidarity lift up all poor and working class people and diminish bigotry.   Intersectionality reduces class solidarity and actually promotes the growth of the far right.it's sad that this even needs to be said.Almost like people should be judged on character not race gender or creed.Identity politics sounds great because in theory you gain more representation of more cultures and ideas.  However more often than not you are left nearly blinded by the fact that because they are a minority they must hold the ideals of the minorities they appear to represent when they in fact are merely a vehicle for the same crap used to oppress the minorities who put their trust in them.So everyone has their 1 share of GME right? Biggest transfer of wealth 'bout to pop off.Of course those who own the communication lines told us that after they ""let"" us talk with eachother!History told meIndeed over time wealth disparities appear and grow some folks are always able to figure out ways to grab more than their share.

Civil war wasn't just about freeing slaves even though that's what history books in public schools teach us.\s\sWhether history is true or not needs to be interpreted by evidence.Yet giving it all to the billionaires is A-OK.Nah.

We need a new plan peopleRedistributing other people's wealth works until you run out of their money.Can you explain how that happens?If America is to survive the Republican party needs to die.> Republican party\s\sParty politics in general needs to die.Only if the deplorable corrupt democrat party is killed as well.All these people pulling their hair out over Trump. What do they think happens when he goes away? We say that MAGA folks have this deluded vision of how America used to be so great and we condemn them for it. But the Blue MAGA does the same thing with the same rose tinted glasses over the Clinton Obama and even the Dubya years. Like Trump is the only problem in our country and once hes gone we ""win.""\s\sTrump is such small fucking potatoes and totally out of his element and in over his head. He cant even keep an administration together without unprecedented amounts of turnover and resignations. Trump is just a symptom of a much larger problem. I'm more afraid of the billionaire class the Chenys the Mitch McConnells the Bushes Clintons et all. Everyone that got our country to fall so far behind the other wealthiest nations in the world.\s\sBut it's all ""Trump Trump Trump."" The Democrats platform is literally ""just beat Trump."" That's the only idea they campaign on. People believe that returning the country to the same climate that led to Trump's rise in the first place is somehow desirable.I’m blaming MSNBC over everything elseBefore Trump was elected: *TRUMP IS GONNA DEPORT/KILL/IMPRISON ALL THE ILLEGAL ALIENS POLICE WILL MURDER BLACKS FREELY THE ECONOMY WILL COLLAPSE AND WE WILL BE IN WW3!*\s\sAfter Trump was elected: *Alright so there were less deportations under Trump than Obama and less police shootings too and ok the economy was at a record high and multiple wars have ended but...

Theres nothing socialist about the American economy thats why its so fucked up.Is this a better analogy instead of the government spending tax dollars on a social safety net for all Americans they use that money to make golden parachutes for their friends and donors.Exactly this! Enough is enough!Why do people keep pu.ing this fake socialiat resistance grifter?Bingo. The idea that Trump caused this rather than simply rose to power and participated in the final stages of its decline *as a result of that decline* is as ahistorical and foolish as thinking that a badly maintained car broke down because of a cheap battery when you haven't changed the oil in ten years. \s\sOur country's problems have been postponed and made worse for decade after decade and what little social stability we had after the 60's was achieved solely by coasting on the limited gains of the New Deal era as the wealthy classes slowly chipped them all away into dust. \s\sIn short it's 1890 again but with computers and Trump is not just a problem but a symptom of a dying empire with internal colonies slums ghettos hollers and bantustans that encompass more of the population every year.I almost want to gild this; excellent post and this is spot on the problems with our politics right now.smoke & mirrors + divide & conquer = TrumpStill voting for BidenNope voting Green!

This is twice (that we know of!) the democrat party has committed election fraud and election rigging.Bro I literally just made this point. Ppl acting like we weren’t already a failure before Trump.*neolibs> Ppl acting like we weren’t already a failure before Trump.\s\sThe top 5% literally cannot accept that!It's a gated community mentality.  They didn't mind people like Trump plundering and stealing from *the poors* as all the craters left behind were all on the outside.  Remember when Democrats and liberals *LOVED* Trump? I do.  \s\sTrump saw how soft they had gotten ignoring the growing chaos outside the gates. In their arrogance it never occurred them that a **corporate pirate** might break the unwritten rule that corporate pirates must always punch down and never punch up.  \s\sNow Trump has been doing muddy 4x4 donuts all over their million dollar ""safe spaces"".  They have become so numb to reality that don't know what to do when *the poors* aren't falling in line to save them from Trump.  They are desperately working to get that MSNBC grand republic fantasy back and go back to ignoring *the poors* sinking into the sludge outside their gated community.This is 1 out of many reasons I hate Biden so much corporate Socialism isn’t capitalism.No but it sure seems like the natural progression from capitalism. Success generates a feedback loop leading to more success and eventually enterprises become so successful they have the power to begin altering law and influencing politics. How could that eventual development from an initial ""untainted"" capitalism be prevented?I find it immensely weird that the great-again America these ppl are screaming for is back when you could support a family with one decent paying job...due in large part to organized labor. Back when education was of high quality and affordable infrastructure was a top priority jobs in science were seen as prestigious not solely for income but for the innovations that benefitted everyone they often produced.\s\sBasically what they and their predecessors have spent the last 40+ years frothing at the mouth to systematically dismantle AND THAT *THEY* FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO DISPARAGE AND DESTROY.\s\sCredit where it's due it's gotta be one of the most successful long cons in history.Most people that end up voting for republicans I don’t think were very politically active to begin with. I just think that the democrat party has totally lost touch with the working class to the point when they hear some politician talking about some hot air means tested bullshit they get confused annoyed and disenfranchised. So the gop panders to them about A. taxes and B. Their patriotism. All the while proposing and passing legislation that screws them over again and again and they have successfully been brainwashed to a point that it’s going to take some serious work to get them to understand what’s actually going on.Government intervention a self-fullfilling profecy\s\sInterviene when there isn't any real problem make things worse and say the solution is that you didn't have enouth government\s\sWhy people still fall for it after what it did to helfcare and education is beyond me> support a family with one decent paying job\s\sYou’re leaving out the part about how women entering the workforce and the fall of the nuclear family doubled the size of the labor market. Also women tend to spend extraordinary amounts of money on education only to work for a few years then retire to childcare today.\s\sThe wages in the 50s weren’t simply good “because of unions.” They were also good because society was efficiently organized around the family and not “women’s freedom.”\s\sEducation was also high quality and affordable because the demand was lower before women commonly started entering university. \s\sAnd infrastructure *is* a top priority for Trump. Have you been living under a rock?\s\shttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-16/trump-team-weighs-1-trillion-for-infrastructure-to-spur-economy\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_policy_of_Donald_Trump#2017-19\s\sSounds like less of a “con job” and more of you just strawmanning people you disagree with.When you say ""support a family"" can you clarify what you're talking about? What was the average home size? How many cars did the family have? How many TVs? What kind of technology? What educational resources were available?\s\sAs for jobs what was the competition like for these great jobs? Was this dream existence available to anyone who wanted it? Even say a black gay man? A Jewish lesbian?\s\sIf you look at how people lived back then most people could raise a family by those standards in many cities in the USA on a single income today. You're not going to have four cars a McMansion and annual family vacations to Disney World but if you want a 1200sqft home one car one TV no technology and low cost education it's doable.Most standard rank-and-file Democratic voters would agree with that take. You could go back 10 years and they’d agree with that take. \s\sThe problem is getting those same voters to realize that it’s not just the Republicans who have caused this; that the Democratic party’s contributions to these problems are not simply due to Republican intransigence but because they largely agree with the overall agenda.Obama’s total failure as a POTUS is not eradicated by zealots constantly attacking his successor.Obama’s only failure was not kicking conservatives lawmakers out when they were willing to cripple the government just to undermine him.Agree with what he said except the “socialism for corporations.” It makes no sense unless you think “socialism is when the government does stuff and the more stuff they do the more socialister it is.”The issue is socializing the costs and privatizing the profits. The taxpayers put so much money toward advancing private industry in this country that it's not even funny and we almost never see a return on investment. All of that money gets siphoned away to the billionaire class while they simultaneously jack up the prices of drugs that we subsidized the research for and manufacture weapons of mass destruction to kill innocent people in other countries.It's not an analogy it's literally policy. Whether we are talking about tax cuts for the rich and big corporations or talking about the auto industry bailout in 2008 or Quantitative Easing (printing money) or the CARES act which is arguably responsible for keeping the stock market near record highs despite 30 million people being unemployed. Refusing to budge on the federal minimum wage which was always meant to provide a living wage. Companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon can get away with paying full time workers below the federal poverty line in income. Those workers then apply for and depend on federal and state aid like Medicaid and SNAP nutritional benefits (food stamps). All of this comes at the cost of the taxpayers the overwhelming majority of which are working class people. Our country subsidizes and socializes labor cost and losses for big corporations. We already live in a socialist society. \s\sIf you collect a paycheck in the United States you are directly subsidizing the low paid workers that get these and other benefits. Meanwhile the Walton family or Jeff Bezos own several billion dollars in wealth. You likely pay a higher tax rate as a percentage of your income than many of the rich do as well. Because of the low tax rates on investment income and trades. As we speak the Fed is printing and pumping millions upon millions of dollars into private equity groups. During the middle of a global pandemic and global recession these private equity groups representing the richest people in the world are soaring in value. \s\sThere are many other policies and aspects these are just a few I've mentioned. But the net result is that in the United States today it's socialism for the rich and big corporations and rugged individualism for everyone else.Yes and no and I say that as a leftist. \s\sThe idea of hypothetical ""corporate socialism"" is instructive because it combats the ridiculous belief that's been beaten into people's heads about how the government can't do anything efficiently etc. The reality is that we live in a kind of inverted socialism- or maybe what would happen if a bunch of elites read Marx's *Kapital* and completely reversed the values set in it. \s\sAbove a certain level of wealth the state serves as a social democratic entity for wealthy people and corporations. It bails them out. It protects them from excessive liability. It protects them from systemic risk. it subsidizes their risks and experiments and makes sure to encourage a nurturing environment for their children their sick and injured etc. It's responsive to the wants and needs of the 1% ers and changes when their beliefs shift as multiple studies on oligarchy in America have shown. \s\sI think it was Sheldon Wollin who said we were essentially living in a system of inverted totalitarianism. I say we're living in a system of inverted social democracy too where those who need the benefits of socialist or socdem policies are denied them and those who don't need them have rich social democratic-type frameworks to cushion the hardships of the market system for themselves.Comments:\s\s>And people's willingness to play along in the Merican dream manifest destiny.\s\s*\s\s>Yes. People need to realize that they deserve more from their governments than they’re getting. We cater too much to those that hold the balance of power. Demand better representation & establish new parties that will improve conditions for the vast majority.\s\s*\s\s>Totally agree as the system was cleverly set up to be contingent on $$$ before you can even qualify for a debate nevermind get elected. Hence a financial democracy where money buys candidates and elections to keep the ""system"" alive under the guise of an actual democracy....\s\s*\s\s>Telling NeoLib Dems their preferred choice is not all that different from the choice they reject really makes them angry. The #DNC stance on social issues cloud the Dem voters minds to the parties complicity in exploitive economic policies.\s\s*\s\s>And it took a grifter of Trump’s incompetence to bring it into the light.\s\s*\s\s>Not to mention a foreign policy that has had American Exceptionalism at its core leading to pain misery and death for millions worldwide.\s\s*\s\s>Correction: Trickle down economics worked EXACTLY as planned. It had 1 very specific goal the destruction of the middle class. They have succeeded in that we are now a majority poor country. Feudalism was the goal with a permanent upper class.>Feudalism was the goal with a permanent upper class.\s\sSome truth in that except it's NEO-Feudalism. The upper class gets all the rights and riches and has none of the responsibilities. (That seems to be at the root of *all* the Neo-isms of these latter days: All for Us and Nothing for You.)He's 100% correct. Trump is a symptom of a larger cancer not the tumor itself. The DNC and people like the Lincoln Project only want to treat the symptoms not the disease. Biden supporters want to use an old bigoted predatory white guy to defeat another old bigoted predatory white guy.> people like the Lincoln Project only want to treat the symptoms\s\sNot really. They just want to be cause of the symptoms not the upstart Trump.>Trump is a symptom of a larger cancer not the tumor itself.\s\sTrue.  I remember hearing a song at a rally along those lines back in 2004.  Don't remember the verses but the chorus was\s\s'Cause the Emperor needs some new clothes  \sAnd the Emperor needs a new home  \sBut we have to be sure when the Emperor goes  \sThat the Emperor won't go alone.\s\sUnfortunately the Emperor did go alone.

I'd say it's always been pretty much trickle down (if that) except for the New Deal(s) and the Great Society.   However I care more about how and when it will end than I do when it started.It's always been trickle up. From the poor to the rich. In the 80s the propaganda just got more sophisticated. It was never trickle down.Gen-X checking in yup yup been watching this freekshow forever. And now the neo-shit-libs act like republicans more and more sigh. Voting 3rd party for progressThey are mask off now. Welcoming and giving platforms to Bush-era neo-cons because ""orange man bad"" while shitting on progressives (again) tells me all I need to know about the Democratic Party. The Overton window has been moved so far to the right and MSNBC reflects that.  My middle-aged punk-rocker dad who gifted me with Chomsky books in my teenaged years and who DESPISED THE BUSHs is now trying to get me to read David Frum and watch Nicole Wallace.  All because he watches MSNBC religiously. He now parrots their arguments against Bernie. So sad :(\s\sVoting 3rd party as well.  He shit a brick and tried to shame me when I told him. How predictable.GenX screen name checks out.If I vote Green Party and trump were to win my state should I then feel partially guilty? Because the obvious choice in my mind is to vote green but it seems like that won’t even make a tiny dent in fixing our completely broken systemIt's true ; wouldn't complete 100% honesty demand that we admit that this current situation is not all Trump's fault?They realize that when talking about the transition from Obama to Bush. Liberals are hypocrites.Absolutely. This sub is right to identify a fetishized image of Trump as the ""root of all failures"" for a chunk of liberals. At the same time say we could somehow quantify Trump's responsibility for the ""current situation"". Say he were responsible for 10% of it - and that replacing him with even a milquetoast Dem would remedy this modest fraction of the issue. Why wouldn't we? Because our efforts to improve beyond this 10% evaporate when we accept this obvious solution to a *portion* of the problem? Then it seems like a lot of the people in this sub have as much to learn about the importance of everything *in between* presidential elections as the liberals you criticize do.""Tricke down"" economics dosen't exist. It's a strawman created by the left to slander suply-side economics by pretending it has something to do with giving money to the rich\s\sAnd it baffles me saying you are a socialist isn't political suicide like saying you are a Nazi is for example.

It's not complicated and has nothing to do with democracy.there has been something of a figurate jackboot on the people's throaths since the dawn of man both from nature and people. Neither the weather nor chief Krodukk are valid examples of fascism. Fascism is not just when anyone acts ""authoritarian"" or subjugates your will it is complicated.What is feudalism then if not a figurative jackboot on people's throat? Coercive societies have existed since the dawn of time. Its really just the degree to how coercive they are.Isnt that what democrats did during 2020 election.

No chance anyone actually running the guantlet of our electoral process is anything but hungry for both and willing to do whatever is needed to get and keep it.Politicians of a political party must follow the policies of that party.

When Congress imposed human rights restrictions—by then there was a human rights movement in Congress—to block the flow of advanced weaponry to Indonesia Carter arranged through Mondale—the Vice President—to get Israel to send U.S. skyhawks to Indonesia to enable Indonesia to complete what turned out to be near genocide killing maybe a quarter of the population or something.\s>\s> In the Middle East—Carter just won the Nobel Prize—his great achievement was the Camp David agreements.  The Camp David agreements are presented as a diplomatic triumph for the United States.  In fact they were a diplomatic *catastrophe*.  At Camp David the United States and Israel accepted finally Egypt's 1971 offer which the U.S. had rejected at the time.  Except that now it was worse from the U.S.-Israeli point of view because it included the Palestinians.  In order to get Israel to accept Egypt's 1971 offer after a major war and atrocities and so on Carter raised military and other aid to Israel to more than 50% of total aid worldwide.  Israel used it at once in exactly the way they said they were going to do and as every sane person knew as an opportunity to attack their northern neighbor first in 1978 then in 1982 and increase integration of the occupied territories.\s>\s> And that's for starters.  We can continue.Everyone look better once they leave evil house aka White House.It just sickens me that were currently living through Ronald Reagan's 11th term.

To say that because Bernie lost in primary therefore he would've lost in general is the most bullshit answer ever given that his strongest supporters were independents who are less likely to vote during primaries compared to DNC loyalists.\s\sMoreover poll after poll showed that the overwhelming reason for DNC primary voters voted Biden was because they were told that he had the best chance at beating Trump because of 'electability' whatever that means. At the same time poll after poll showed that Bernie's policies were extremely popular.

I'm just wondering where I can learn about this info dont downvote me.What the hell are you talking about? Bernie polled very well in matchup polls against Trump. And in terms of his popularity nationally and within his own state he's been the most popular politician in the US several times over the last five years.\s\sIf you get downvoted it's because you're spouting falsehoods as fact.Look at the size of his rallies the long lines of people waiting to hear him speak and compare it to any of the other candidates who ran against him. That's no guarantee they'd all turn out and cast a vote for him but to claim that Biden won when he could hardly fill a high school gymnasium against a man with thousands coming out to his rallies is utter bullshit and just one indicator that something was very rotten in Denmark.Is no one going to bring up the fact that they used COVID as an excuse to not hold primaries?\s\sI registered as a democrat for the first time so I could vote in the primaries and my state delayed ours until like August when everyone had already dropped out.\s\sOur electoral system is an absolute farce and this covid bullshit has fucked up literally everything good in lifeShadow shmaddow or Maddow shmaddow its all ALL\s\sA☆L☆L\s\sOne big hustle.

I assume that's an annual bill but $267B seems like an interesting number if it means ending hunger forever which I can't even comprehend how they'd be confident to ever accomplish.In 2009 a UN study said about $30B.  Adjusted for inflation that would still be under $100B.  But whichever of those orders of magnitude it is it's clearly a worthwhile expenditure unlike the spending that goes toward murdering millions of brown people and further enriching capitalists through weapons manufacturing.If you listen closely you can hear the sound of hands rubbing together in the background of the ""$262B"".\s\sWorld aid has always been a thieving grift.And some pf you complain about Elon Musk 🙄Sadly this has been the case for the last 70 years or so I think they've fleeced us of immense wealth :(Socialism for defense contractors harsh capitalism for the people.Normally I'd agree with you tbh.

COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution misdirection and control of a internet forum\s2. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation\s3. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist\s4. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent)\s5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression\s______________________________________________________________________________________\s \s \sCOINTELPRO Techniques for dilution misdirection and control of a internet forum..\s \sThere are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.'\s \sTechnique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'\s \sIf a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist which can be called upon to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.\s \sTechnique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'\s \sA second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.'\s \sTechnique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'\s \sTopic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.\s \sTechnique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'\s \sInformation collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.\s \sTechnique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING'\s \sStatistically there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.\s \sTechnique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'\s \sIt is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings deleting memberships flooding and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.\s \sCONCLUSION\s \sRemember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.The Gentleperson's Guide To Forum Spies.Good info. I suspect cointelpro technique #6 occurred in /r/antiwork. Any pointers to the other 5 topics you listed?>  To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. **Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers** and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video.\s\sOne or two? lololFYI u/santefe (who has been turtled) just marked my post with a snake emoji award.

The elites have been very successful in doing so. We can have both class and race consciousness. It’s not a zero sum game.Everyone needs to visit this breaking points post to see it in action.

When the capitalist realized the authoritarians in Russia were more interested in stomping on their own people into the ground then conquering  their capitalist assets they turned to dismantle the social democracry FDR built to save the country from capitalist overthrow.  The boomer capitalists accelerated the collapse and overthrew the American Republic one congressional cycle at a time.  At this point our national government has completely collapsed.   What is left is a shallow  facsimile to dismantle and liquidate the American people's remaining assets.  What happens when they have noting left to sell off?From Dean Baker:\s\s>The minimum wage would be $24 today if it kept pace with productivity\shttps://labortribune.com/opinion-u-s-minimum-wage-has-failed-to-keep-up/We workers must stop supporting this system with our work and our consumerism.\s\sGeneral Strikes!\s\sCivil disobedience is the only way.I’ve been general striking since January and WILL NOT return to work for anybody but friends/family.\s\sJust waiting for others to join but I legit would rather suffer and die under poverty than waste my life working in torturous“comfort” just so some soulless cretins can buy a third summer home.Thank you for that nice Processed Farnsworth ref!Yes bring on more inflation. That’s what we all want. More inflation more inflation!!!!The federal minimum wage hasn't increased in over a decade. Prices have sure remained stagnant during that time. /s\s\sDo you even listen to yourself?\s\sTime to pull this out of the dustbin.\s\sLet me play some math for you here. The average national payroll cost on a company is ~25% (includes wages benefits payroll tax workers comp unemployed ins.). It can vary from as little as 15% to as much as 50% (depending on industry) but it averages around 25% nationally. You can look that up. The remaining 75% of cost to an average company is overhead inventory debt etc.\s\sFor simplicity let's say hypothetical small company A (that pays mostly minimum wage) spent $1M in cost last year. At 25% of cost payroll was about $250K. Now let's say you double the minimum wage (ie: approximately double payroll). The company is now spending $500k on payroll and their total expenditures are $1.25M. So even though their payroll doubled their total cost only went up 12.5%. Even if downstream (also minimum wage) sees and passes on the same cost markup that's still at most another 12.5% for a total of 25% cost increase.\s\sSounds like a lot but you have to consider every employee just saw their pay double. They now have twice as much money to spend. So a 12.5% to 25% average increase in cost sees a 100% increase in money to spend. Now multiply that over a whole state or whole country. This is why workers at McDonald's in Norway can be payed $22/hr and yet their BigMacs only cost ~30 cents more than ours (update: now cheaper than ours).\s\sBut I'm sure you'll say 25% of cost is just the average what about those companies where payroll makes up half their total costs. How are they going to survive? The answer is those companies with oversized payrolls tend to be sit down style restaurants. When Seattle raised it's minimum wage to $15 there was a huge outcry that the restaurant's would be run out of business and dry up because of it. Fast forward a few years later under the $15 minimum wage and Seattle's restaurant scene was doing as well as it ever had (at least until covid hit).He's leaving out a million factors one being china's own influence on our labour markets.\sPretty big one honestly.It was never the billionaires or corporations it’s the federal reserve and it will continue happening if people don’t figure that fact out.Does anyone want to explain how fiat currency is to blame? Along with the government printing of money? I mean we all are feeling the effects of trump printing trillions for covid and it aint going to get any better oncd biden is done with the money printer. They have been pretty heavily devalueing the currency for year's and it's been a major problem since we switched to fiat completely under nixion. Money printer going burrr is very bad for your quality of life and is a major issue. The blame is being placed in the wrong place. \s\sIt's basic supply and demand principles. If the demand for money is x and I flood the market with ten trillion dollars the demand is going to go down. Because there's such a huge supply. But because there's such a huge supply the value of the money is going down. When the value goes down the demand for money goes up. Leading to more money being printed which lowers the demand for a time and then since the value has gone down. The demand goes back up. Now Hypothetically this is supposed to be a balanced system this is how any supply and demand works. But the issue is fiat. By decree the government says this is the supply so your demand changes slowly. The supply can be changed on a whim. Your feelings a trillion dollars from 2 year's ago now and you best believe your going to be feelings all the money we are still printing! It doesn't stop. Each dollar in is just fractionally devaluing your money. So all your savings are becoming worth less and less day by day. While your demand keeps going up and instead of adressing the problem your being distracted with something that isn't the problem.\s\sYou all are currently being told that the corporations are the problem you don't have enough and it's really the federal reserve.eh a bit of apple and oranges a bit of truth. If all the extra money printed would be used in the market that the normal guy also uses (grocery etc) we would get affected. but that filthy speculative money of the ultra rich is not used in normal markets but in the luxury segment and for the most part as investment just to increase their amount of power. We dont realize this we're not directly affected by the steadily growing concentration of wealth of power. The fact that Bill Gates is the largest owner of farmland doesn't directly affect us. The fact that Blackrock & co are owning half the planet doesn't affect us directly. Our slavery remains abstract and 99% of us will remain clueless about the shape of our shackles. We will just take it as granted that we have to work 40 50 60 hours to just get by. It's just the way it is. It is that way because power is a beast that works in the shadows and we don't understand it. We're too exhausted by the work they demand from us and too distracted by the entertainment they provide.And that's not even taking into account the amount of greed and exploitation already present in 1960 lolHow can we get things like minimum wage tied to inflation?\s\sI like turtlesBy taking a hint from the rest of the world that has somehow managed with a *lot* less wealth to have a livable minimum wage *and* healthcare *and* retirement funds. While not having their roads bridges and plumbing collapsing all over.\s\sFirst step: stop waging war over half the world and *dramatically* cut your offense budget.When min wage law hikes are promoted a lot of people have begun demanding it not only be hiked to the current living waste at the very least but also be indexed automatically to inflation so its not reliant on politicians looking to keep their donors happy.  I think a number if other things in government are similarly linked.\s\sUnfortunatelythat can only pass if the current crop.of donor-prioritizing politicians buck the donor class to do it.  Catch-22.The Federal Reserve is an unelected banking industry cabal that runs America's monetary policy.  Their polices always advantages their corporate casinos effectively locking the American people into a captive economy.  The FED must be dissolved.  Period.Nobody ever wants to hear this but productivity shot up and scaled with workplace automation (computers). It's not worker's productivity that is rising so fast.There are economies of scale with everything and technology does help but you still need people on the other end. The Federal reserve printing trillions of dollars over the course of several decades probably played a bigger factor here than most people would be comfortable admitting.the hole in your argument is that those with the $$$ own everything produced by workers including the technology automatons and inventions developed by workers. So from your argument the wealthy elites will continue increasing wealth disparity because they have the wealth to begin with. That would result in a society of sick ineffectively educated homeless poverty wage labor citizens and their children and elderly existing as a disenfranchised slave labor sub-culture. Oh wait! It hAs resulted in a society of...They are holding themselves and the economy back by doing this as well. All this to keep people down. We have lost 60 years of a solid income multiplier due to their spite. With that we could have stayed at the front of education and innovation instead of slowing losing all our leads. We could have lifted the world up with us now we are starting to fall behind in many metrics.everyone would be fired20 of which are lost somewhere within the ""lost"" Pentagon expenses to fuck over just about everything and nobody is even pretending to care about it.That's pretty much the tip of the iceberg when you consider all of the massive transfers of wealth in the form of bailouts tax breaks wars and other disasters.If the gap increased from $0 to $16.75 the average gap is likely around $8.37 not $17.  Still trillions though.  Come to think of it he uses the phrase ""at least $17"" when rounding up to $17 who does that?[Receipts](https://time.com/5888024/50-trillion-income-inequality-america/)Has Catherine Austin Fitts crossed your radar?And corporations used a strong centralized government to do it.Does anyone have a clearer picture on these numbers? Probably a low ballMinimum wage increases are a price floor increase not a raise.There should be a class action lawsuit for reparations for the stolen $50T. All the $$$ is easily traceable to the descendants and sub corps through the decades.Work hard save money start a business  grow the business by putting everything you own up for collateral create jobs for people and more tax revenue for the government then have a communist tell a bunch of sheep that you owe them everything for your success! But if your business goes under and you loose everything it’s all your fault!Productivity increases have nothing to do with laborers. Machines computers streamlining and logistics are the source of productivity increases.Yes and the monetary benefits of those increases go to shareholders not even necessarily the people responsible for the innovations but the shareholders at their companies. If workplaces were democratically operated and owned by workers then the benefits of this production increase would go straight to the workers.Cops need to fill up these private prisons. That's why cops keep brutality between them and people in the community. Cops are forced to see everyone fit for private prison. Also [there is quota system](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+cops+arrest+quotas) that cops must arrest certain number - to get paid (?).""Are there no bankers?

I was really hoping you weren't a real personDidn't Mama Bear do the same thing?What if we put caps on charges like Japan does?Think just having transparency will automatically make a huge stint that will force hospitals to readjust pricing because the amount they are charging is simply criminal.What if we dropped the prices by letting people compare and such?I've read stories of someone getting a massive bill then asking the hospital for an itemized recipient and suddenly their charges are drastically reduced. Like they can't even justify their gouging when pressed on it. \s\sOne of the things people conveniently leave out when they ask how we can ""afford"" M4A is that having a single payer will drastically reduce costs. The federal and/or state governments won't get bent over like the rest of us do. Someone covered via private insurance can have the exact same treatment as someone covered under Medicare and the latter will be charged way less. So aside from having everyone covered you also end up with more realistic prices. The government won't be taking one thousand in tax dollars to purchase a single EpiPen for someone or they won't spend thousands for somebody getting a vicodin in the ER. \s\sPharma is far and away the biggest lobbyist. Hospitals and insurance crack the top 10. Billions are being spent to compromise politicians influence legislation and sponsor news media. The for-profit healthcare system does not want to lose their golden goose and once people realize how easily we can streamline our healthcare and reduce costs it'll be difficult to ever return to this ass backwards clusterfuck of a racket we have now. \s\sThe state I live in actually did a pretty good job of allowing people to get onto Medicaid during the pandemic. I was laid off for 10 months and it was a relief being able to have it. It sucks now needing to go back to getting insurance from my employer and paying massive fees and deductibles. The pandemic really should have been the final nail in the coffin for our system...you have all these people laid off because of shutdowns then you end up with all these people being uninsured during a pandemic. The fact that people are still trying to defend this bullshit gives me such little hope that itll ever be reformed. \s\sEven supposed ""left wing"" media like CNN or MSNBC is constantly shoving advertising from pharma or insurance down their viewer's throats. That's why they'll never bite the hand that feeds them and why they're also decidedly not left wing. \s\sHaving transparent hospital costs is ostensibly a bipartisan no-brainer. So is preventing drugs from costing significantly more than they do in other countries. Unless you work for the for-profit healthcare industry there should be no reason why you'd defend this bullshit. Most people think it's abhorrent that a drug can cost magnitudes more here than in Canada but since we are an oligarchy and not a democracy that doesn't really count for much.When we pay medical bills weren't just paying for ourselves.  We are paying for the nine other people that didn't pay.  Either you let socialism in the front door to take a thin slice of pie or experience capitalism kicking in our back doors to steal every pie and every future pie until we die.  It's not that complicated.Reminder that right wing pundit like Candace Owen actually talked about this and believe medical transparency is something that needs to be fought for which I absolutely agree. \s\sMedical transparency is as good as a nonpartisan plank as anything material and both left and right should embrace transparent pricing at the very least if they are somehow crazy enough to not support m4a ( or Medicare plus which is Tulsi's platform).One of the few policies trump did that helps Medicare 4 all .\s\s.\s\sHealthcare transparency ... thank you Trump on this oneThey got massive bailouts from the covid packages too. In return they have cut services to the underserved.\s\sHospital corporations like Cleveland Clinic have huge endowments in the $10 billion range.We’ve  all watched Bernie sanders get screwed not once but twice now we’ve all watched the squad stomped into dust by the democratic machine time and time again the United States political system exists to keep profits high and corporate hemogony in tact to sit here and to continue making a policy based argument is death by a 1000 cuts.

Their focus is not on ""what can we do to help Americans' lives be better"" but instead is ""how can we manipulate Americans' psyches so we can keep the gravy train coming"".\s\sProblem is messaging =/= substance.

I have cheap hobbies a job I enjoy a small home an old car and I don't have any desire to have more than that. I'd rather other people achieve a degree of comfort than live in luxury myself. It's bizarre that so many people fall for Capitalist propaganda telling them that they need to buy needless shit consume and hoard in order to be happy.of everything you just said the sad part is that a *billionaire* would not have to tone down ANY part of their way of life to help ease the suffering of the world. \s\sFuck if I just had ONE billion dollars...  I could give 80% of that away and me and my children would still never want for anything for the rest of our livesI had someone argue against basic income because they ""love their toys (motorcycles boats RVs etc...)"" How can we buy all our toys if there's more economic justice is essentially what they were saying.\s\sWe don't need austerity for economic justice.  \s\sIt's not one or the other that's a false choice.IMO what's really sad are the people that fall for propaganda not capitalist (I have nothing against capitalism) that makes them think their civic duty as an American is to consume. Go to the shopping mall and satisfy the two biggest addictions Americans have shopping and eating especially eating. Sometimes I wonder how these massive people can even take a shit they're so huge with a big SUV waiting outside the mall so they can get all that stupid shit they bought home stopping for jelly roll and donuts of course. Too prosperous for our own good sometimes. But capitalism is the only way this country can survive the Socialist experiment has been done in China and the former USSR and if memory serves a lot of people died due to starvation and homicide to avoid starvation and tyrannical government greed. That's why we have a second amendment to avoid just that. Death tolls were somewhere in the high Millions in China alone..... I'm sticking with capitalism but agree that especially before the pandemic people just spent money and stuffed their faces in general kind of sad.Exactly!I agree about the basic survival needs. Re-distribution of wealth is a slippery slope however. I'd like to see some of the elite put their money where their mouth is so far as helping the American people but I don't think most of them really care about the American people only themselves. I highly doubt a wealthy politician can relate to someone who works 9 hours a day to barely scrape by. And although $600 is $600 it is kind of a slap in the face when compared to what many people have lost already. They want more of themselves and less for everyone else.Tbh I'd love to have a 40 bed mansion. I would house all of my friends that are struggling to make ends meet all the homeless I meet every week from donating food all those who just need an escape for a few days / weeks / months from shitty situations.\s\sAlthough none of this would be necessary if we were given livable wages or universal standards for needs. But still. I'd love to be a millionaire to redistribute the fortune.We shouldn't have to break out the guillotines to get our money back.  Yet if they want to fight us for every couch penny.  So be it.  There is more of us than there are of them by design.  Let's see how it plays out.I could not agree more. But I think we're going to have to be breaking out the guillotines because they have no intention of making us whole again financially or otherwise. Hopefully I'm wrong. So you have to see what happens and that's pretty easy considering there's very little we can do but see what happens and then act accordingly. For now I'm not going to jump the gun although part of me wants to. Just going to watch and wait for a little while see if any of those wonderful campaign promises actually happen especially with Bernie Sanders and Trump conveniently agreeing with him on the $2000 emergency survival money. Very very odd so let's wait and see but keep on your guard and read between the lines IMO.See that's what so many ""progressives"" don't get. The wealthy don't make any distinction regarding the size of your ask. You're a filthy peasant! Asking for ***anything*** is perceived as a direct threat to their wealth and privilege! They won't tolerate it. Rip the veil from your eyes - we're still living in the middle ages as far as they're concerned.And they are laughing their asses all the way to the bank. I could not agree more my friend.Superrich eat what we eat. Breath the same oxygen we do. There is nothing to feel jealous about.I occasionally pity them what with the dark empty holes they have where their hearts should be. They are not well in mind or spirit. Then I remember that they kill people who work for them in pursuit of more zeros on their bank accounts and I get angry again. Billionaires are dangerous predators and they need to be removed from the gene pool.I don't think it's so much about jealousy or who is super rich; it's who holds the real power (and the fact that they don't give a crap about the rest of us). Whether or not they breathe or eat I'm not sure how that has baring. Genghis Khan Hitler Fidel Castro the list goes on ad infinitum all ate and breathed but I highly doubt the super Elites eat what most people eat because most people could not afford a personal chef cook extremely expensive food for them every night etc...IMOWatch how fast this incident fades in the ether  because Americans memories suck and this story won’t receive mainstream attentionIt has a pushbar and a spotlight on it!\s\sMaybe if it was an older crown vic there'd be a chance it was a retired cop car that was sold to the public but when it's a car that at most could be 10 years old?

They let Fred Hampton live right until he went from feeding poor black children to feeding poor children. His intention to regulate the Federal Reserve was one crime too many for Kennedy. Having power and rejecting the elite capitalist class is a death sentence even today. The lack of public assassinations today is due to the lack of people with any power fighting for the poor and especially their lack of an ability to accomplish anything if they try. The elite used the carrot and stick approach until it was heresy to accomplish anything beyond empty promises to get elected; either we can donate millions to your party and help you get elected or we can kill you so what was that about a tax hike? When people say they'd kill to have a billion dollars they actually aren't joking. Imagine who a greedy person would kill to protect multi-billions after they've gotten it.

Then abolish college all together it is just a place for privilaged kids to party and fuck.Depends on the profession. Certain things like business really don't need more than a 2 year or an ""extra degree"" like MBA.  Others like programming engineering chemistry etc. A 4 year is more important.  There's no real ""learn calculus"" on the job...Also colleges are a financial scam. They are not 'institutions of higher learning'. They are just one more way that investment banks have hijacked a revenue stream to use to play the stock market.\s\sColleges have endowment funds in the billions. Growing this fund is  their goal not providing a useful education.This of course is over-generalized.  Some parents and students kill themselves working and borrowing.  All the education-relating debt in this country is not reflected in student loans and it isn't all owed by rich parents who raised privileged kids.\s\sThe solution isn't to bash education students or their families but to make colleges and trade schools affordable (or free) for those who want to attend either one--and to respect all those who need to work for a living.does no one here realize why they don't want to cancel the debts? doing so would have the same effect as 2008. these debts are highly collateralized ang financial institutions have been bundling them as investment instruments.\s\sforgiving those debts would cause a system shock to the stock market.Biden is a scummy piece of shit.

Like every politician in a position of power does...Every time this happen I wonder if we should put the limit to 1 mandate. \s\sBut that would mean no carrier politician like sanders.More significant is that the two Delaware senators voted against the minimum wage increase. One of them is Biden’s stooge.Damn it feels good tweeting all these memes at her to shame her.Oh how fast they fall huh? You don't change the Democratic party. The party changes you!Sinema is a liar and traitor to hard working people in this Country. She has sold us out and has to be primaried. It’s one thing to work with colleagues across the political spectrum. It’s entirely another to abandon Dems on a fundamental tenet of policy.[any elected democrat] is a liar and traitor to hard working people in this CountrySo not only do elected officials deem their representative responsibility fungible they are also sociopaths.How many more of these Two=Faced Monsters are among Us ?She’s fkn 45 years old...Money talks.It also serves uwu 🥰👎🏻🤗I love do-gooder turned whore stories.That was a long time ago and possibly not sincere to begin with. \s\sSpecter ran as a Democrat. When that was not open to him he ran as a Republican until he could no longer win a Republican primary.

They are all working together.Doing a touchdown dance is not a symptom. And you're a bit too forgiving of this piece of shit molded into a Karen.She didn't have to take the fall though it needed 60 to pass as an amendment and zero Republicans voted yes. So she did it from her heart.AOC is not this bad yet but if Sinema doesn't lose her seat she eventually will be.You’re saying Sinema staying in office will make AOC worse?  Is that an assessment of the bar being ever-lowered or something regarding AOC that I’m missing?Only Tulsi can save us now.All these bitches will nvr pay for screwing ppl lives 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬This isn't her failing. This is her volunteering for villain rotation. Every other Democrat betrayed us just as much as she did but as long as she successfully distracts us none of them will catch any flak for it.OK I see what's going on.\s\sSinema is challenging Joe Manchin for the throne of the moderate democrat which would give HER the tying vote in the Senate.\s\sThe next two years will be a race to see who is furthest to the right.\s\sI hope I am wrong though!I think you're on to something and making my call now for Manchin.  West Virginia seems way more conservative and uneducated compared to Arizona.AOC isn’t far behind Sinema. In 10 years she will become Nancy Pelosi.Buddy look at the ads AOC ran when she was running for congress and look at her now. It didn't take ten years it took three.This is my take. I’m so sad to say that. I don’t know why but intuition says she’s the exact personality to be manipulated into believing “Compromise is necessary to move anything forward” and then the next  thing you know “Sorry we shot down healthcare again in 2036 but we had to reach across the aisle. My hands are tied!”Downvoted for being right.AOC has denounced Sinema and Manchin for their opposition to the minimum wage. There is no comparison. [Cortez](https://www.reddit.com/r/AOCPrez2028/) is the leader the progressive movement (supplanting Bernie). Sinema is Republican-lite. One-hundred-eighty degree difference.bullshit. this is the type of garbage that keeps the left from taking ANY power in the party. infighting and sectarianism. AOC is an ally to the left without a doubt and the fact that she didn’t push jimmy dore’s stupid fucking M4A vote idea (wouldn’t have worked) doesn’t change thatSame boobs in 50.She is a scumbag piece of shit who dresses like a ho so she can be pimped out by the neoliberals and republicans a fraud who portrayed herself as a poor people’s champion but she was a lying deceitful political street walker everyone notice how she touched to try and get McConnell attention on the back to show off her little political poledance for him thumbs down for him he straight ignored her too like a true pimpMr. Smith goes to Washington alternate dark side ending*Kyrsten Sinema's Swamp Tale*\s\shttps://www.dailyposter.com/p/kyrsten-sinemas-swamp-taleVote based on identity get politics based on class but only against workers.

Get rid of the police then see how quickly you need to buy a gun for yourself.I already own multiple firearms and a ton of ammunitionIf the cops keep operating as they are people are going to have to buy arms to protect themselves FROM the police. Cops rarely ever stop crime especially violent crime. They either show up to a situation that they aren't trained to handle and completely fuck things up or they show up after the fact and serve as the clean up crew.

Just as lawyers are doing their job by putting people away on drug charges and furthering their career.Indeed.  The problem is that most people have been fed copraganda their whole lives and have no idea what their job actually is.  To the point where the conditioning is so strong that they can literally see centuries-long history of systemic violence and abuse and they start using wild conjecture to come to conclusions like ""they need MORE funding/training/etc"" and ""it must just be a culture problem"" etc. instead of simply applying Occam's razor and immediately coming to the reasonable and obvious conclusion that their job has been shit the whole time.There are songs condemning anyone in a leadership/authority position \s\sAnother brick on the wall is complaining about teachers the whole time \s\sMany of Muse's songs talk about how everyone in power is corrupt \s\sA general point of music is rebelling against a perceived authority figureFirefighters have to deal with fires.

They might vote Green or another third party. Maybe they will just not vote but I have never seen anyone here suggest they would vote Republican. \s\sIt is not about the Republicans it is about moving the Democrats left and telling them that if they want our vote they need to earn it.\s\s[There’s a video of Lawrence O’Donnell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=FqRNnIMDkUY&feature=emb_logo) years ago saying something that would get him fired from MSNBC in a heartbeat:\s\s> “If you want to pull the major party that is closest to the way you’re thinking to what you’re thinking you must show them that you’re capable of not voting for them. **If you don’t show them that you’re capable of not voting for them they don’t have to listen to you. I promise you that. I worked within the Democratic Party.

Clueless unsympathetic POS.  Probably sucked Trump’s dick as well.Wrong he’s the democrats’ scapegoat for telling the people why they couldn’t pass any progressive laws or legislation. Both parties don’t give afAnd swallowed.No it's not. West Virginia is a +30 republican state. Without Manchin we would be having a McConnel led senate.\s\sedit: WHY THE FUCK IS THIS UPVOTED HERE?!?!?And what is that getting us? Nothing just like if republicans were in charge. Democrats are the fake opposition party.I mean you right.6 weeks and your fired.I somehow got recommended this post and I am literally dumbfounded by how little sense this makes. There are currently 50 Democratic Senators. If people had chosen to withhold their vote from Democrats they thought weren't good enough there would be even fewer. Instead of the meager infrastructure bill we are likely to pass there wouldn't even be a glimmer of hope of passing any meaningful legislation. In what world would that be better?\s\sThis is why Bernie and others like him campaign for Democrats in general elections. Because he's not an idiot. He cares about immediate outcomes for working people. Anyone who chooses not to vote when they know full well that one party is closer to the outcomes they would prefer does not.[When you elect a ""centrist"" like Biden it guarantees we won't get what we need for at least 8 years](https://i.imgur.com/itzWfVI.png) because if Biden/Harris do two terms that will be 8 years of no medicare for all significant climate action or end to the police state and if they lose reelection then you have a guarantee that a Republican will come in and not help us for their 4 years. So either way you slice it you are screwed for eight years no matter what when you ""vote blue no matter who."" So you are better off not electing the centrist voting third party then working to get a real progressive elected in four years. \s\s[There’s a video of Lawrence O’Donnell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=FqRNnIMDkUY&feature=emb_logo) years ago saying something that would get him fired from MSNBC in a heartbeat:\s\s> “If you want to pull the major party that is closest to the way you’re thinking to what you’re thinking you must show them that you’re capable of not voting for them. **If you don’t show them that you’re capable of not voting for them they don’t have to listen to you.

Though most of us also have far more honor than Democratic partisans what we do not have is a prior promise to support the organization in exchange for participation in their primary process.

Biden is as much a part of the problem as Manchin and Sinema. He has NO clue how to use the bully pulpit in order to push his own agenda. He should be holding Manchin's feet over the fire by threatening to have the DOJ investigate all of the shady shit his family is involved in. He could also go to WV and talk to Manchin's constituents directly and point out how their own senator is actively pushing out key benefits of the BBB plan that WV families desperately need to improve their lives. Unfortunately Biden is too weak to consider being like FDR or LBJ.Thats what happens when you wont fight for M4A.Politico has been forced to deal with reality.\s\sSo they do.

Warren or Biden 2020!Lmao shut upBarf. Go home.Your trolling has zero nuance or wit. You're obviously up past your normal hours. Or you're still mourning the Night Mother not winning in 2016.Gee it all makes sense! Warren's got nothing left so she resorts to pedantic smear tactics. She's revealed herself to be the biggest Fauxgresssive of them all. Warren is a spoiler candidate she is not our friend and she knows her chances are fading quick. I can't wait for Iowa.She's trying to drag Bernie down with her. He's got the most loyal supporters of all candidates it's clear to any campaign strategist that smearing Bernie won't aid you at all quite the opposite.We’re going to need her supporters to get us over the hump. Let’s not alienate them now by attacking her campaign in this way. While I don’t necessarily disagree with anything you said I think we can let nature take its course here. \s\sShe’s falling and Bernie is surging. That’s what really matters.Another trash article that calls this a turnaround.""Famously curmudgeonly""\s\sShut up or tell the whole truth for once PoliticoAnd of course now she plays the ""gender card"" (the news story on CNN and others today). Nothing could be lower. She's DISGUSTING.\s\sAll part of the plan though it doesn't surprise me at all. Warren has been a spoiler candidate from day one. I'll never understand how progressives could ever get behind her when she didn't even endorse Bernie in 2016 (not to mention her weekly lies).\s\sImagine the campaign money that went to Warren that should've gone to Sanders. Imagine the weak minded that will follow her lead when she endorses someone other than Bernie.Agreed. Elizabeth Warren is the quintiessential example of blood-sucking lawyer period. She's smart enough to right from wrong but she doesn't care because he were only allegiance is to who pays her. Yuck.Dripping with sexism... y'all claim to be progressive but you're not and you can't even see itOutside of her gender and her native american heritage what is the allure to Liz (over Bernie)?She can get progressives to vote for her (apparently not!) by giving lip service to progressive values without actually fighting for progressive causes.Libs who think the only problem in America is corruption and only warren can fix itShe’s corporate friendly.She has a plan for that....  Actually I really admired Warren's fight against big banks and creation of the CFPB but I feel that there was little carrythrough to legislation that actually prevents the next meltdown.  She has all the right words but doesn't seem to be able to put them into action in a way that helps us.It’s the same allure Obama had. Someone who isn’t a white man saying progressive things who will ultimately fail to live up to the progressive rhetoric.\s\sA vote for warren is a vote for the status quo. Only sanders and yang represent meaningful change.She's Hillary 2.0. That's pretty much it.Warren has fucked upShe listened to the wrong advice. Then again she's the one who hired those advisors.She has a plan /sAre you referring to her stance on M4A or am I out of the loop on something?Ahhhhhh YES that headlineDivision is not a good move.You might want to have a talk with Warren about that.They won’t stop the revolution.When was Warren ever a progressive?She's between 1/64th and 1/1024th progressive. That's good enough for some people.That one brief moment she said that she agreed with BernieWhen she was running for Senate> When was Warren ever a progressive?\s\sShe came up with the consumer financial protection bureau. Other than that she was a republican corporate lawyer for a long time. Maybe that time made her realize they were evil.I honestly think she could of broke far more leftist-populist than she ended up.  There was a point going into 2016 where she was potentially the one who could of led the opposition.  She could of run and been in Bernie’s place back then and now.\s\sBut she likely hired beltway establishment “experts” who advised her not to challenge Hillary.  To play ball.  Don’t rock the boat and Hillary will grant her a plum spot and maybe one very limited in scope policy to champion.  Warren bought into their bullshit (because quite frankly she lacks the courage backbone and clarity of vision necessary for real leadership) refused to run in 2016 played coy and refused to endorse Bernie who she supposedly is a hair’s breadth away from in policy and thus sealed her fate.\s\sWhat is now the working class leftist-independent-populist Bernie Tulsi Nina AOC etc coalition could of been Warren’s.  But she got played by the Clintonites (probably pretty easily) and consequently reduced to the Dem establishment’s last ditch option to trick voters into buying their bullshit for another cycle.  A bargain bin Obama as she doesn’t even have his talent for oration.\s\sThis coalition was Liz’s to lead going into 2016.  If she had stepped up she could have very likely been in Bernie’s position today.  But she blinked multiple times and lost her chance.\s\sThe lesson for everyone else especially new candidates: \s\sDon’t be Liz.\s\sDon’t listen to establishment “experts” advise you to play ball.  They are not there to help you.  They are there to undermine your actual influence and protect the status quo.  If you actually want to take power away from the corrupt and murderous neolibs and Deep State and empower the People then Bernie Tulsi and AOC are the path to follow.Bern it up or burn it downAfter ""progs"" get their selfies with Liz she has nothing else they want that Bernie didn't have first and better.downvote in less than a minute.\s\stry again!The cranky warren supporters are out downvoting like mad.Up to 96% now.\s\sAnother fail from the Warren camp.\s\s:)What race is this man? They're all social constructs and world views. Which one predominates?/r/im14andthisisdeepI'm sorry but isn't this what happened last time and he still lost?\s\sYa'll get satiated too easily.  It's not over UNTIL he is elected.  Maybe we should get off reddit for a little bit and go door to door to make sure people are registering and young people are voting?\s\sI accept my down-votes from the more inclined to virtue signal than do any actual work the rest of you thanks.All of it is important. Phone-banking and canvassing is important. Building the rhetoric necessary to counteract bad-faith attacks is important too.No you're right. Everyone here should phonebank and canvass. Register people inform them. Don't waste your time with winemoms on twitter bashing Bernie. We are here to win. And that means work.It's a fair point but in 2016 Hillary was still slightly ahead of Bernie in most national polling. Yes we should phonebank and canvass and do all those face-to-face encounters to get everyone in our community on the Bernie train. \s\sThat said many of us her are really noticing something spectacular about Elizabeth Warren. Just last week the general consensus was that EW was at least *somewhat* less power craven and deplorable than Hillary Clinton. When Hillary acted like a jerk it wasn't a big deal because that was what people had come to expect from her. That's the difference.The division that has been sowed amongst the progressive wing isn't good for any of us. It's all too convenient. Biden knows his only chance of winning the nomination is to stay at or near the top of the field just like Romney did in 2012 and Paul/Santorum were surging. He knows Warren has the best chance of uniting the progressive and moderate wing and taking her out is essential to his campaign strategy. With Warren no longer a factor they can focus their efforts on Bernie and his 'electability issue' and secure the nomination. For Bernie to sweep the nomination it's imperative that she takes votes away from Biden/Buttigieg and stays in the field. The Republican party hoping for a repeat of 2016 knows this as well and they are banking on the fact that the progressives will cannabalize themselves; there are forces at work to ensure this happens. Just look at all the conservative outlets who are eating this Sanders/Warren drama up.

Or at least one of them was.When a civil rights icon like John Lewis had discussions with another influential black congressman who was also involved in the Civil Rights movement like Jim Clyburn that slogans like Defund the Police is hurting the Black Lives Matter movement and is going to hurt Democrats in this election then maybe it’s time to pay attention to their warnings instead of listening to a 31 year old bartender representing a gentrified liberal bubble district in NYC.Lmao what truce? She hasn’t stopped[This might help AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1261025403071803393?s=20) Both the Texas governor and progressives have used this incident to push their own opinions about the GND. \sI don't know how this relates to the Green New Deal.\s\sMass power outages happened in Texas because of Texas's strange and ridiculous decision to have their own power grid for the primary reason of avoiding federal regulations. Because Texas did not have federal regulations that would require energy infrastructure to cold weather capabilities natural gas equipment and wind turbines were all interfered by the snow and freezing temperatures. \s\sThis article explains it quickly and well:\s\s\shttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/why-texas-energy-grid-unable-handle-winter-storms-n1258049This is petty of me and only thinly related to the context of the tweet but every time I read/hear ""Green New Deal"" it makes me twitch just from how weird it *sounds*. The cadence of the pronunciation doesn't fit itself well into any sentence no matter how you alter the stresses and the combination of tones is painfully displeasing. It creates this sense of ""These words do not belong together"" rather like a nonsense phrase used for memorization which causes the mind to stop processing them for meaning and just dismiss them as auditory noise representing a vague concept.\s\s...which is basically what the GND is but anyway.\s\sThe name of it sounds like a college student's branding project thrown together approximately twenty minutes before it was due. It's just silly.You're right that the name sounds bad. The text of the resolution is actually even more like a last-minute college project. I read it over a lunch break a while back and I kept grinding my teeth. It's an absurd hill to die on.How about she shows solidarity with the people of Texas and not make everything about her. SMHThe GND is not any form of tangible legislative action so essentially what she's saying here is that just saying you want to do something about the climate is enough to prevent problems like this.\s\sThis is basically one tiny baby-step above ""thoughts and prayers.""Let’s not be assholes. The Texas infrastructure was built on generations of fossil kickbacks. It’s not just *snow* it’s erratic climate behavior. We don’t defend AOC here nor do we downplay climate change.\s\sEDIT: the issue with the GND wasn’t its ideals and goals but rather how\sIt was used as a purity test during the primaries (and beyond) to cynically trap electable liberal pols. There’s nothing wrong with a non-binding value statement when it is actually a genuine value statement. Texas is actually in the shit right now because of their climate deniability. Their value statement was to double down.I'm not downplaying climate change I'm snarking about her 'non binding resolution of values which will cost nothing' being an effective bulwark against climate change.The problem is that people are dying from the cold and stupid decisions made by Texas RIGHT NOW and what exactly does grandstanding about the GND do to fix that?> The Texas infrastructure was built on generations of fossil kickbacks. It’s not just snow it’s erratic climate behavior.\s\sMost infrastructure was. Texas is suffering in particular because they deliberately kept their network infrastructure separated from the rest of the country to avoid federal regulation. (Even after the federal government subsidised it ridiculously.)\s\sIf all their power was green and for some reason it under performed you'd have the same issues because they don't have ways to bring in power from elsewhereThis is why Dems have this perception of having a messaging problem. It’s cuz idiots like Bernie and the squad keep spending more damn bashing Dems than they do the GOP. And how are Dems turning their back on the working class when wages are rising when essentially a jobs bill was passed with the Infrastructure Bill when millions more now have healthcare because more have enrolled in Obamacare this past year etc… What the hell has the GOP done for the working class? Hell what the has HE done for the working class?! I’m so sick of this curmudgeon!Yup. Stimmy child tax credit boosted ACA subsidies infrastructure bill eviction moratorium and a whole bunch of worker-friendly executive actions. And a massive social spending package that's supported by nearly every Dem save for a guy in a Trump+100000000 state. Not to mention the Dem-run states and localities that already have universal pre-K free after school $15 minimum wage extended protection for renters additional paid time off and so on.\s\sBut yeah other than all that Dems have totally turned their backs on the working class.His individual points aren’t wrong and actually pretty good but the facts are that a) he’s done fuck all to help anyone but himself despite being entirely capable of writing these bills himself and b) how the hell does anyone NOT get that ‘working class’ is just code for ‘white people’ these days?Black people get it.\s\sWhich is why we never supported him as a whole.Back to Bernie doing Bernie.  Its his ""status quo.""Okay if he’s still alive in 2024 he’s definitely running again.  Ugh.This might sound crazy but if it wasn’t for my man Harry Reid SANDERS WOULD HAVE RAN AGAINST OBAMA IN 2012!!I kinda don't think he will but particularly if Joe runs again I don't think so. It's hard to imagine him gearing up a run in the middle of Joe's term and attacking Joe while he's in the White House. But then it's Bernie so who fucking knows. That ego is out of control.He keeps falling back on this ""us vs them"" rhetoric and his base goes rabid for the red meat (much like another Qult).  \s\sHe needs to realize that more progressive policies come with more democrats voted in.  Primarying and replacing people like Manchin and Sinema in deep red and purple states with his acolytes just give a win for the republicans.\s\sDude needs to grow the fuck up especially at his age.He drags people down to prop himself up. Cause he's got not much to offer.I think Sanders is failing and has turned his back on the working class.But bernie’s entire support base is the… non working class… how can you say you support the working class while only focusing on people who don’t work?Nothing says for the working class as much as giving a portion of Americans a one time no-strings attached debt forgiveness lottery ticket and giving the rationale that the extra money will flow down and lift all the people up.He’s finger wagging again in anticipation for the 2024 grift he’s going to launch next yearBlack voters aren't fooled into voting republican. So who's the fool here?1. He's not a democrat\s2. He can't muster the energy to attack republicans\s3. He himself hasn't done shit\s\sSo whats the point of this? Democrat inadequacy is not an excuse for republican obstruction. What did Bernie do during the Trump administration's control of government? Was he more successful?""Perennial loser claims he has sole key to victory""\s\sPiss off traitor.Of course Bernie is wrong and won’t ever get why he is wrong. \s\sDemocrats started 2021 believing they were going to repeat FDR’s work which was delusional with a 50/50 Senate and a super slim House majority. \s\sThe Build Back Better bill was a disaster and a sign that Democrats grossly overestimated what was in their ability to get done. Hopefully they will flush it this year and break out the parts that people understand so they have something to show in the general election because nobody cares about the infrastructure bill they already passed.Bernie is always saying this. He's just repeating himself with the same talking points for years.\s\s""Democrats have abandoned the working class!' - yeah they're doing so by pushing the BBB plan which targets Right To Work laws striking them down strengthening unions and this isn't even counting the massive push to raise minimum wage across the country.""Working class."" I wish this bleach demon would say what he means for once.The GOP pretends to care about the white working classWhat modern day democrats in the house and senate are anti-LGBTQ+? I’m afraid she’s went off the deep end if she’s starting to place traits of the most trump controlled republicans on her more moderate counterparts. Even Manchin isn’t anti-LGBTQ+ or something like that.I don’t have a problem necessarily with primarying bad representatives and I would say anti-LGBTQ or NRA backed Dems to not be so great if they’re in a Blue District.\s\sBut how many is that really? It doesn’t seem to be the Dems as a whole so her complaint about the establishment seems like a claim about w couple people.Dan Lipinski of IL-3 (D+6) is probably the best/only example as he was successfully primaried by a candidate supported by Justice Democrats almost exactly a year ago today.Manchin was the only democrat that voted with republicans on the trans sports amendment. He's not pro LGBTQ+.Henry Cuellar (D-TX) has a fairly poor score from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBT issues and doesn't believe gender identity should be a protected class.Didn't literally every Democrat in the House vote for the Equality Act?Joe Manchin apparently. But other than that I cant think of many.\s\sJoe manchin is basically a Republican tbhYou mean like the anti-choice candidate that Bernie campaigned with and defended campaigning with right in the middle of the Trump admin?  \s\shttps://www.npr.org/2017/04/20/524962482/sanders-defends-campaigning-for-anti-abortion-rights-democratAs late as 2008 he was against gay marriage.\s\s In 2006 he said marriage equality was a states' rights issue and he opposed federal recognition of gay rights.Communists just love clamping down on reproductive rights. Look at china for most of modern history.Ugh *of course* he did that. He doesn't give a fuck about anything that doesn't affect white males such as himself. Same as always.And yet she rails against Joe Manchin and Abigail Spanberger both of whom represent deep red Trump areas.WV is R+19 while Spanberger’s district is R+6. Her district is certainly red but I’m not sure if I would call it *deep* red though it’s the same rating as Budget Palin Boebert’s district. Still AOC doesn’t rail against Spanberger for her voting record she rails against her for (correctly) pointing out that “defund the police” was poor messaging.Is red-blue colorblindness a thing? She might have that.What about the representative from New York who is in a safe seat but doesn't do fuck all except play a high stakes online popularity game for her own benefit while shitting on everyone she should be trying to build bridges with? \s\sIf she was this bad at getting along with people when she was a bartender I could see why she'd be forced to seek a career in politics; I wouldn't even waste a dime being at a bar in front of someone who is this much of a miserable asshat.I honestly genuinely wonder how other members in the House feel about her. I think we got a glimpse of it when she was voted against to lead that committee but I wonder at large how they feel.Call me a corporatist neoliberal shitlib but [I think these people should be a higher priority to remove from congress.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html)Okay?? She never ever targets Rethuglicanz. And that’s for a reason.Too bad the sales pitch that attracts the most voters makes the far-left gag so the winning strategy will slowly lose the angsty left and hand Republicans another term.There’s literally like 1 of them left.with Lipinski gone who's left? Henry Cuellar?Well yeah but don't expect her cult to fack-check her.For me the “safe because they’re paid off by [insert big bad wolf corporation or conservative org here] who control things behind the scenes“ was the eye roll on the top of the shit sundae. Scapegoats are what we use when engaging with people who disagree with us and dealing with complicated issues is just too damn hard. \s\sI remember listening to Preet Bhahrara interview a gun control activist who explained that the reason we can’t have gun control is that the NRA works against the activists and controls everything behind the scenes. At the time it sounded like a cop out to excuse the failures of the gun control movement to really engage people who disagree in good faith. A year later the NRA is bankrupt infiltrated by Russian agents and a disgrace to all but the complete fringe. And we still don’t have gun control.The role of the NRA in getting to this point is undeniable. If race is the third rail of American politics then NRA stuck a jumper on the tracks and arc'ed it. They tied no gun restrictions to white supremacy. They also pushed an agenda which successfully made it to the Supreme Court to make the kind of weapons control that's done for anything but a handgun extremely difficult to do with handguns. The result is a rate of gun violence that we've all just resigned ourselves to taking for granted. After a while it perpetuates itself because fear casts a long shadow and we've lost the capacity to be shocked by any of it.It's easier to pretend that your ideas are being stopped by a handful of bad actors (wall street dnc the establishment the deep state) than it is to confront the realities of complex issues or worse admit that maybe your views aren't as popular as you think. It's the constant talking point that AOC Trump Bernie use to explain their failures and opposition because they can't defend their ideas and obstacles in a proper way. AOC isn't trying to do a critique of Joe Manchin she's signalling to her base that her opponents are not legitimate and anyone defending them is being manipulated by a cabal. It's populism and borderline stoking of conspiracy theories.That person was absolutely correct. The NRA was really sophisticated in how it lobbied against gun control and turned what used to be a fairly bipartisan issue into a bitter culture war spat. Just because a year later they are mostly defunct doesn't mean that decades of lobbying and advertising has fallen away. \s\sNot to mention that with their fall gun control activists have been seeing more and more success.She knows Progressives can only win in D safe seats lol. They haven't won a single competitive seat.If you define ""progressive"" as ""Dems that officially designate as being part of the Progressive Caucus"" then technically that's not true there have been a couple cases of progressives winning competitive seats. Katie Porter and Andy Kim come to mind.Bernie and NRA love each other. Is she mad she’s becoming irrelevant more and more?It also begs the question that if those representatives (or at least reps with similar platforms) have been in that role for a long time that moderation could be why it is a “safe” seat. Have absolutely had districts that were considered safe flip because Dems pushed a more liberal candidate. The problem with big tent politics is you can’t just assume a safe district will remain safe if you move outward policy-wise (unlike identity politics where as long as you keep key components you can fluctuate on everything else without imploding a la current Republican Party)AOC is a great example of that herself. She is pulling less in her super safe seat than Crowley did.\s\sCrowley regular got 80%+ of the general vote. She got 78% in 2018 and 75% in 2020.The big donors/wall st/special interests thing is the trumpist populism of the left. I admit I fell for it at first with Bernie but good lord you'd think 4-5 years later now we'd be able to acknowledge the dangers and toxicity of populism. It's a cult.Wall Street is such a circlejerk thing to complain about. No not everyone working in finance is pure evil and they're certainly not manipulating everything behind the scenes. They have jobs that overall benefit society but like any job does need regulations. Though it isn't a bad thing that she's dedicated herself to upsetting and attacking the major industry of NYC which is probably the only part of New York State that would tolerate her trying to be a senator or governor.Seeing how Reddit has acted on the Gamestop fiasco it is clear that they have no clue of even the basic idea of modern finance. For them ""Wall Street"" is a voodoo system with mystical properties and some people somehow profit.Bernie literally got elected by the NRA.>Thats OK beause bernieI mean...you can be entirely left aside from one single issue and still want to run for that office...Name names or it never happened.To people against my STRAWMAN.... There are STRAWMEN in seats because REASONS.\s\sAnd therefore I tweet!Funny that she's never had anything to say as far as I can tell about Sanders' complicated relationship with the NRA.Wait who is she talking about here?Cuellar probably comes close.How many house reps in safe D districts are actually anti-LGBTQ+?  I know Dan Lipinski was one but he did get primaries out last year (and good riddance).  But who else?Just the one apparently...\- My policies/ ideas are a surefire win to expand the Dem majority in the House\s\s\- Most of my issues are with Dems in safe blue seats.\s\sPick one.Everyone in the nra is anti lgbtI *do* think there's a such thing as Democratic representatives who could stand to be more liberal with certain things but the answer to this is not for a sitting rep to back primary challengers. There's nothing wrong with primaries but that money would be better spent on unseating Republicans so it's unreasonable for the Justice Dems to get pissed at the party for their policy on people who work with challengers.\s\sI also think the caucus as a whole is *well* aware of who the ""unnecessarily right wing Democrats"" are. There's a reason that Cuellar's challenger got a lot more endorsements than he did and no sitting reps besides Pelosi and the DCCC chair endorsed him.Here's my thing...\s\sFor a person who claims to be dialed into what is happening in this country she is so damn oblivious of the fact that the Republicans are applauding her efforts to destroy the Democrats from the inside. WE need to primary her ass and let her see what it feels like.Jesus I’m not looking forward to the day when she changes her legal name to Alexandria Ocommunist-CortezBloomberg is not a big donnor has no special interests in gun control. \s\s\shttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/mike-bloombergs-gun-control-outspends-nra-helps-democrats-win-virginia.htmlI don’t necessarily mind primary challenges as much as some others do. It’s a democracy people have the right to primary someone if they don’t feel they represent them.\s\sBut how many Dems is she talking about here?https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1231412884539879424She can't count can she?She's right but also wrong. A frustrating place to be for sure.\s\sI do still like though how she doesn't pretend Republicans are ever genuine or truthful in their words or actions.And yet she herself has one of the worst Politifact ratings for being truthful of any House Dem. Something like 80% of her statements are rated partly false false or ""pants on fire"".\s\sWe really don't need a Trump of the left.The gun control debate makes me want to lie down with a wet rag on my forehead.\s\sThe second-biggest reason (after conservative fearmongering) we can't get basic reforms done is because of lefty overreach at home and abroad. About half the country - not just Republicans - think that those reforms are the first part of a process that ends with them stripped of their right to own firearms. And they're not entirely unjustified in thinking that. The example of the UK as well as certain other European countries shows that it can happen and the Very Woke People who keep shooting their mouths off about mass confiscation and registration make it so much easier for conservatives to convince people that that is what we're aiming at. The idea of having to beg the government for permission to own a shotgun or a hunting rifle is repugnant to hundreds of millions of Americans including myself.I would consider myself an extremist on the issue of the Second Amendment in that I want a Twenty-Eighth Amendment repealing it entirely. I bring this up not to start a discussion about our disparate views on the topic because I'm as unlikely to change your mind on this as you are mine; I bring this up instead only because I have one request:\s\sPoint me to those influential Democrats calling for anything remotely close to my preferred policy on this topic if you genuinely believe they are somehow making it easier for Republicans to fearmonger about what the mainstream left/liberal position is.> hundreds of millions of Americans including myself.\s\sRoughly 60 million adult Americans own guns so I think you're off by a fair bit there.The number of ""leftists"" who have unironically defended Bernie for voting in favor of an NRA-sponsored bill that immunized gun manufacturers from lawsuits.... my god.There are conservative POC who side with the NRA and are anti LGBTQ- they voted for Trump in greater numbers this time then they did last time. Take that on first babe 👌I wonder if anyone told AOC if Bernie voted against the “Children’s Health Insurance Program” that 9.6 million Children get their healthcare from and including the healthcare she got as a Child lol. \s \sReminder that Clyburn Pelosi & Schumer all voted for the program in the House while Bernie didn’t.**Participate in deciding the future of the sub!**\s\s * [Voting Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSca7bqVFp1gEUUsR_iy9NIFo3VppzYN8j71-_yGbIY88hOzkA/viewform)\s * [Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/jsv1q2/ess_lets_talk_about_the_future_of_the_sub_2020/)\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

She called out Kamala Harris's hypocrisy on jailing people for smoking weed when she smoked it herself and didn't become a complete cuck like Bernie did when Biden and the rest of the centrists dropped out to back the guy.

Literally no other college or employer was allowed to do this at the school but totally cool for a marine to be hanging out just cracking jokes with kids.Exactly. It’s corrupt for a potential employer to set up in the lunch room so students can gauge interest yet it’s fine to ask them to sacrifice themselves for oil.Does that include JROTC programs?  I hope so.YES. Fuck this abhorrent practice of luring in children to fight oligarchs' wars.Whenever I see anyone talking to a recruiter I point out to them that having that conversation automatically increases their chances of drug addiction homelessness and suicide.Only issue I see is the countless wars America is in aside from that the military has hundreds of fields and trades to teach people plus’s benefitsThey shouldn’t be in schools.

0,DemocraticSocialism,ReallyAmerican,242,"Vermont Election Info\s\s[Register to Vote](https://olvr.vermont.gov/)He ain't wrong. The Democratic Party is too broad and needs to splinter from Progressive Centrist and Conservative factions within the party to legitimate opposition parties (in opposition to the Neo-Fascist/Theocratic  Plutocrats of the GOP). The USA must rid itself of the two-party system that dominates the political arena to achieve actual representative governance.That's a great take. Right now we have dems voting against the build back better plan because it doesn't encapsulate *enough* of what they want. While I'm disappointed that the original infrastructure plan didn't pass I am grateful that I can see that the democratic party is about as useful right now as a paper towel in a hurricane. \s\sThey had resounding victories in the last election cycle and since then? Almost nothing. Nothing to address abortion restrictions (which I do agree is a war against women's rights) voting restrictions (which is the death of democracy as we know it) no real teeth behind COVID vaccination standards and all the while are seemingly content to sit in power and not do anything about it. Say what you will about the current state of the GOP they at least *do* the things that they want--at the detriment of everyone else sure--but its still something else.\s\sI have become so jaded with the lackluster fragmented and downright useless party that claims that they are on the side of the working class.They used to have a name for this... I think it’s called “taxation without representation”. A bunch of people got really upset about it a long time ago and held a tea party or something like that.sounds fun. did they use loose leaf or was it tea bags?\s\s if the latter  I'm only down to play if we use the pyramid shaped ones that come individually boxed.🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼I recently found out just how many kids are being pulled out of public school just this last year alone. One school district in Washington state claims to have had a 7% over a thousand students drop in enrollment since before the pandemic and that's just one district.Since we can't all go on strike without becoming homeless they pretty much have it all wired. I read this and thought it would make a great dystopian society....then I remembered where I have to go tomorrow.We *could* all general strike and bring the machine to its knees but that kind of effort has been preemptively neutered by a century+ propaganda campaign by capitalists who want the idea to be censored obfuscated and viewed with shame. “Don’t strike get to work if you can’t ‘handle it’ just quit” blah blah. \s\sA mass cross industry worker strike and consumer strike (refusing to purchase product and/or pay bills) would bring the whole house of cards down. The 99.9% has all the power it’s just hidden from them after centuries of propaganda and social programming.it hurts so badThis is why I can't wait to end my lifeYa that sounds like the usa don't it.YUUUUUP\s\sWe’re screaming who’s listeningreally have to clarify who ""they"" are.\s\sit isn't the government. they are literally the only ones funding public anything.\s\sis it the ""less spending"" idiots and the corporate-communists? yes yes it is.Except it is the current 2 party system in charge of our government holding back the working class.  Both sides of the fence not just one.‘Corporate communist’ lol I remember when this was just a lefty meme now its on fox news“They” are the wealthy ruling class. Always has been always will be. The existence of a wealthy class who owns 99% of land capital resources wealth etc. will always use any means necessary to maintain and expand their power. \s\sIdk what you mean by “corporate communists” but they definitely don’t exist. It’s rhetoric used to obfuscate definitions of words hide their meaning thus censoring the thoughts and ideas behind them. Those are just corporations who have used their overwhelming resources to enter into government bend the rules to benefit themselves exclusively erected barriers of entry to prevent workers from entering (campaign finance and corporate owned media propaganda) and changing things and *sabotaged* any efforts to benefit the working class. That’s the nature of the beast when a ruling class exists and owns all the resources. “The government doesn’t work” is their excuse yet it “doesn’t work” because they won’t let it they intentionally sabotage and derail and legitimate efforts. People eat it up and nod along. Capitalism was *never* intended to be free motivated by liberty or individual rights.  Those are “feel good” cookies handed out by the ruling class to make the workers think they have freedom. The ruling class ain’t reading Locke Hobbes Smith etc and using their moral philosophies when making decisions. It’s a charade.you have to take into account the universal understanding that everything mentioned is to some degree actively operating with some level of government funding. this indicates the intended subject matter is adequate funding not absolute funding.Agreed how in the world a court can argue that evictions are legal in the middle of a global pandemic is simply vicious and brutal.WhAt AbOuT tHe LaNdLoRd.It's because billionaires get to enjoy socialism provided by the poor. The poor have to endure capitalism provided by billionaires. \s\sSocialism should only be for those who are unable to participate in capitalism. There's enough for everyone.This is the issue you say take from billionaires more and then immediately target the middle class who have a bit more than you and invested their money wiser than you. Probably all the while making the same yearly wage.I’m Asian and some British guy on the sidewalk randomly called me “fucking communist scum” (actually lol!) last night.

Wtf that's horrible.Why you would willingly live in the UK is beyond me.Unions. \s\sAnything less is perpetuating the problem.Noooooooooooooooo right to work 😩😩Not even less rich really. Imperceptibly less rich.Sure glad none of this happens under socialism...When prisoners consent to their own imprisonment in trade for limitless entertainment and meaningless commodities.Well saidAdios to the government mandated minimum wage. At least for now. I still think the Dems will get it done in some other billMinimum wage = minimum skill. Minimum wage is not meant to be a living wage. It's a starter job usually for younger kids to learn work ethic and responsibilities. If you are an adult still making minimum wage you need to readjust and strive to make a better living for yourself. Don't sit around and whine about how unfair everything is. Hoping a politician will raise taxes on someone else so you can have more without having earned it. You will be in no better place raising minimum wage. The price of everything will adjust to the rising cost of employing a low skilled worker.I hope your trolling. If not this a stupid stereotypical take against it. Minimum wage at is creation was meant to be a living a wage so that anyone working any job full time could live. Also how many times do go to a store or out to lunch during the hours of 8am and 4pm. I bet a lot how are kids supposed to be working there when they are in school? Ie we do need adults to work those jobs. And no the price rise is proportional. Its not oh wages will go up and suddenly something thats 1$ will suddenly be 10$. Something thats 1$ will be $1.50 if that even probably more like 1.15. Even papa Johns said that if they were to raise the wages of their workers and give them benefits they would only need to raise prices by 10 cents.It doesn’t matter what minimum wage “was meant to be” what it currently is is a “livable” wage for those who because of its unlivable amount are in no position to to readjust to make a living because surprise surprise that costs more time and money than working at minimum wage allots for them. And even if you can manage to blame them how are you going to blame their children who are now expected to put in a multiple of the work that others in a more comfortable position are not expected to put in simply to live within the same means as those who might initially be able to rely on such ambitious goals as say going to school full-time instead of working for food and a home for their own family? Either way the less such individuals are paid the more taxes will be offset into social welfare programs designed to ease this burden. Would you rather your own tax money be used for this or the excess money accrued by the wealthy that by all accounts is not being put back into the economy at sufficient rates but rather accumulated sitting stagnant in their own hands? \s\sAs for your last point the price of everything will indeed rise but as seen in previous research not to the point where it offsets their own gains. An example of such is food:\s\shttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=524803\s\sThose making minimum wage will still be better equipped to paying the expected increase than they are at the present point in time.>Minimum wage is not meant to be a living wage.\s\sThis [Law Firm](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/minimum_wage) disagrees:\s\s>The minimum wage was designed to create a minimum standard of living to protect the health and well-being of employees.\s\s\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\s\s>You will be in no better place raising minimum wage.\s\sHere MacDonald's employees over 18 earn 18$ per hour ( [156kr](https://www.vismer.no/sa-mye-tjener-de-som-jobber-pa-mcdonalds-kjenner-du-noen-som-garantert-kommer-til-a-matte-jobbe-der/) ).

God you idiots don't even know your own history. Just stupid.\s\sThey could all go on strike since they are worthless right?100% false my man\s\sRoosevelt intended this rate to be “more than a bare subsistence level.” The minimum wage was created expressly to ensure that people of all skill-levels if they worked could “earn a decent living” off those wages—thus a living wageThe point of capitalism is that every person operating within it has a chance no matter how big or small to become fabulously rich. Stealing money from those who were successful in that climb is counter to the point of why we engage in the system to begin with. It doesn’t matter if I’m not mega rich I can still maintain consistency in my belief system and not compromise my principles. \s\sIf you don’t like capitalism and want to enslave people to produce capital for you when you did not earn it simply because you aren’t capable to climb high enough to obtain it in a world which at its essence is about survival that’s cool. But it isn’t capitalism and those who don’t want to participate in your society and it’s perspective will disagree with you.> enslave people to produce capital for you when you did not earn it\s\sFunny since this is exactly what capitalism isimagine being so desperate that you prefer a 0.000001% chance of becoming a millionaire over eradicating the concept of millionaires itself and let everyone live in moderate wealthThe problem with your logic is more and more and more of the money is flowing into fewer peoples pockets and ending up in bank accounts of rich people and corps oversees in other countries avoiding paying any tax at all to this the US. Also these same rich people aren’t paying their employees even close to what they were getting paid when they “climbed the ladder to success”. You do realize also that most of the rich people beyond the few self made people at the top of tech companies simply inherited their wealth and companies that make them rich? Yea they were so “successful” in that climb. They were born into a rich family so they deserve everything handed to them and the best of everything whereas if you are born into a family of a single parent working two jobs taking care of multiple kids you just have to live at least the beginning of your life in poverty and struggle even though you live in the “greatest country in the world” haha what a joke. Why? So the filthy rich people can own an extra mega yacht. One regular yacht isn’t good enough. They would rather force the rest of the country into poverty so they can buy mansions boats and cars that cost a fortune and most of the money goes into other countries other rich people or corporations pockets. I agree with getting rich I want to be rich. But if I ever become a billionaire personally then I have failed myself and my morals because nobody needs that much money to be healthy happy and take care of the people they love. I would have been giving too much money away and helping too many people to ever become a billionaire. Whereas you would just buy an extra super yacht. The US needs more of me and less of you and we truly would be the greatest country in the world.I think you are missing the point though they rig the system at many levels so they can’t lose and they externalize expenses while internalizing profits. To put it plainly they creat a socialist system for themselves but brutal capitalism for the rest.Hey I know I’m probably not gonna change your perspective but will you just read this? https://qz.com/883348/americans-continue-to-kid-themselves-that-if-you-work-hard-you-can-climb-the-ladder/\s\sAnd maybe this one: https://aninjusticemag.com/the-american-dream-and-other-lies-they-tell-us-3721d3e33fda\s\sI mean if nothing else you’ve read two interesting articles.[deleted]We got a live one here boys.[deleted]I would've agreed if it weren't for the fact that not everybody has the same opportunities some people inherent wealth and for the fact that luck plays such a huge role in determining success. How can you honestly tell poor people to just pull themselves by the boot straps when considering all that? The system wouldn't even work without a lower class working lower paying jobs.Under capitalism it is also normal to let people die of old age let people get cancer let the sun eventually go nova and destroy all life on earth and let the third law of thermodynamics run the universe down into a chaotic particle soup where no life can ever exist again. \s\sIt's all capitalism's fault! \s\sWhy won't people just press the big red button labeled ""fix every problem""??? It's literally that easy. \s\sSelfish bastards.The problem with capitalism is that it turns necessities into commodities which makes life disposable. People that can't afford to live should not have to die. I know I'm a fucking commie for saying that.We should all be taxed the same percentage. rich or poor.Whats your reasoning for that?And make tax avoidance illegalOr a consumption tax on all Luxury goods + secondary homes.Under capitalism you can continuously better yourself so you don’t need to worry about those things.  It’s okay to become poor that can happen to anyone for a wide variety of reasons but if you remain poor that’s your own fault because there’s always opportunity to better yourself.  With Capitalism there’s no excuses you’re responsible do your well-being.What about people born poor? Is it their fault because they were born poor and were left to starvation? Do you think everyone can be a billionaire? No no they can't. Most people die before they even get the chance. \s\sMany people with the potential of becoming successful under capitalism can't even get the education they need because their families were poor.Feel free to donate your money if you want to. Those billionaires that you want to steal money from employ a lot of people provide health care and give them a wage to afford a house payment.LMAO actually those billionaires stole from US and from thousands to millions of people around the world. the only reason billionaires are billionaires is because they've exploited our labor paying literal cents on the dollar in certain countries. a living wage the money that rightfully belongs to the working class instead lines their pockets.Tell that to all of us who physically labor for billionaire CEOs but live off Medicaid and can still barely afford rent haha\s\sGotta make sure they can afford the payments on their fifth yacht/vacation home though rightWhy won’t someone else pay for my stuff ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️- Signed Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo & Others ca 2008[deleted]I know I’ll get downvoted because reditt doesn’t like being disagreed with but the top 1% pays 40 percent of all taxes already. If you took all of the top 1% money it would pay medicare for about 3 years. That’s just one entitlement program. We spend about half our budget (approximately 2 trillion a year) on entitlement programs. Twice as much as we spend on our military. If you are going to disagree with me please do it on the facts. Every time I post something that people disagree with on here I get threats in my inbox.You’re right we shouldn’t just tax the rich that’s short term thinking. We should reorganize society so that overwhelming political and economic power isn’t in the hands of a few. Workplace democracy is the answerBut have you considered that that is only PART of the 1%? Like imagine if all of them who engage in tax fraud/evasion were also paying into it as much as the people who do it the right way? How much better off would the rest of us be?I will disagree with you because your statement conflates two unrelated matters.\s\s1) the top 1% do not pay 40% of all taxes. They pay 40% of income taxes. Your statement that ‘if we took all of their money it would only pay for Medicare for 3 years’ falls under the logical\sFallacy of ‘overwhelming exception’. Sure your state is accurate but it is irrelevant to the issue you are arguing against. See point 2\s\s2) Medicare and Social Security are funded by citizens for the benefit of citizens. Social Security and Medicare are restricted government revenue sources that are to be deposited directly into a trust and disbursed as benefits are paid. These funds can only be used for making benefit payments. These allocations of the budget are sizable because we have a large aging population. The issues facing these two programs are as follows:\sA) congressional inaction - each side merely points the finger at one another but never actually takes action to solve the problem\sB) our population is not reproducing at the same rate it is retiring thus revenues are not be replenished at the rate theyre being depleted as the percentage of citizens over 65 continues to climb (2000: 12.5% | 2019: 16.5% | 2030 estimate: 20.6%)\sC) The monetary policies enacted by Congress & the Fed come at the detriment of Medicare and Social Security. To spur growth the Fed has continued to slash interest rates (with several periods of time where interest was virtually 0%). This negatively affects the Medicare and Social Security trust funds as the funds have to be invested in government bonds. With bond values paying interest in line with bank checking accounts the trust funds are not able to generate interest income to assist in offsetting the additional costs incurred by our aging population and the decline in revenues from our shrinking population.This is a classic example of how to lie with statistics. It’s shameless but effective propaganda which is why the people with the most to gain from it pay propagandists to spread it widely. Anyone pushing this is trying to fool you and you should ignore anything they say on any subject.\s\sThere are two main aspects to the deception.\s\sFirst these numbers refer only to federal income taxes. Both the federal and the income part are important.\s\sThe income tax is not the only tax collected by the federal government — far from it. Just half of the taxes collected by the federal government come from the income tax. About a third come from payroll taxes — which fall much more heavily on working people since they’re largely levied only on the first $130000 or so of earned income.\s\sThis means the rich pay a far lower payroll tax rate than regular people.\s\sSecond the wealthy naturally pay a disproportionate share of federal income taxes because they make a disproportionate share of the country’s income.\s\sTheir goal is to mislead Americans enough that they’ll acquiesce to further cuts in the federal income tax rate. If they succeed the U.S. tax system will grow ever flatter or even perhaps become regressive — that is with poorer Americans paying a higher tax rate than the rich. Don’t fall for it.Just because you can math doesn't mean you're right. \s\sThere are no hungry children in Communist countries ever.Under capitalism it’s normal for people to live their own lives and be free. That’s all.Is black people being a victim of racism or homosexuals a victim of racism an example of this?lmao socialists really have no brain cellsHow about you talk about policy if you’ve got so many brain cells.Socialists have no brains\sCapitalists have no hearts\s\sSocialism is for people who can't participate capitalism. Not for banks getting bailed out by the working class.people have never starved under communismDo you know why people starved under communism?There are few or no organic charities in socialist/communist countries.\s\sCapitalists economy states are ripe with social/charitable organizations.How often do you we see corporations spening 50 million to advertise a 1 million donation? How often do billionaires openly exploit charitable donations to evade taxes? Good thing we let every social instituiton crumble so Jeff Bezos can sell anti-homeless lasers to local police departments. Or so that Raytheon can pay no taxes for charitably installing electric fences around inner city schools.Ok but what about Social Democracies like Denmark? Philanthropy won’t change things for most people the Uber wealthy paying a bit more tax would.Charity is not needed when everyone is taken care of.Why do you think people need charity in the first place?Under communism? They just get shot if they questioned the government a genocide if they’re a minority and everyone starves anyway. But please tell me how capitalist nations not trading with communist ones is why that happens. That’s just further proof that communism doesn’t work.[deleted]ExactlyGood thing that you can read and realized that the original tweet didn't talk about communism at all they were just pointing flaws in a system.\s\sOh wait seems that you can't my bad.\s\sJumping into attack ""the other system""(which wasn't being talked about at all) and getting into defensive mode immediately shows a lack of insecurity and fear to have an actual discussion about what would be better for society for fear to lose what you have or could aspire to have. Nobody said communism it's not like there are other systems or small adjustments that can be done to capitalism itself. No let me make a case of ""us versus them"" so I never have to make a good case for my views and compare a flawed system to another flawed system so I cannot be criticized because ""look the other side is worse"". Ffs middle grounds exist what is with the fucking radicalization on every topic online.\s\sPost: *hey maybe rich people should be taxed a bit more so people don't die without basic cares as much*\s\sYour immediate response: *OH BUT UNDER COMMUNISM PEOPLE GOT KILLED AND DIED OF STARVATION*\s\sNo dialogue about how people are dying of starvation under capitalism at this very moment because your fragile ego got attacked since you relate your whole being to identifying with ideological themes. God forbid that someone worth 5 billion go to being worth 4.5 billion and some people don't die for lack of health care. What a terrible world that would be.Communism =/= authoritarianism.At the bare minimum give me a public option. I don't want my money going to a CEOs shareholders and profits. I want my money to go to helping others. I want my money to be pooled for the greater good.If you were to Listen to Professor Richard D Wolff you would learn how to make this happen his logical way of thinking is similar to yours with exception of the profits he feels they should go to the people instead of Ceos Shareholders and Board Members.Especially seeing as its something every person will eventually need.

That's just what bosses call a job surplus.Not a worker shortage it's a pay shortage.As the TV of a bought billionare politician I can confirm 100%Meanwhile other countries that have had these things in place REALLY don't want it to be like it is in the USA.Infantilizing the American public isn’t a good way to get them on your sideIt's worked since 1776I think the idea is commenting more on information being withheld misrepresented or just plain lied about by those with power or authorityAhh shut upComparing them to children might be overstating it actually. Pretty difficult to underestimate the American public actually.The point is that we are being treated like children by the ruling class.*I was on the fence before with this ""socialism"" thing. But when you compared me to a young child I was sold!*        ""  zsocial democracy 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯Remove health insurance and or socialize healthcare and stop buying gunsI’m not so sure that it’s a good idea for gun nuts to be only folks armed.  If the Democratic Party 180’d on their gun policy it would likely be the death knell of the GOP.  Considering the socioeconomic policies popular amongst the American left such as universal healthcare improved access to a quality education and attainment worker’s rights voter rights and various other policies will do more to reduce crime rates and violence than any gun legislation.\s\sEspecially with the makeup of the current Supreme Court gun legislation will burn a lot of political capital for little benefit.Jim Gaffigan joke from the first pic right?This comparison is kind of garbageWhich comparison? I see two in there. One is that the American people are children. The other is that the billionaire class see themselves as more important more deserving and straight up above the rest of us served with a healthy portion of greed and selfishness.Produce. Consume. Obey. Procreate. RepeatCapitalism 2021: we got rid of retirement for your generation. That means you will be working to enrich some already rich guy until you die! Isn’t that great?'Can you believe theres an entire generation of people looking to mooch off of your hardwork. Bunch of freeloaders want stable housing and food on their plate while they dont work at all! for up to 40 years or so to boot!... anyways vote republican we care about seniors'.That's more like ""The American Dream"" capitalism has always been the same opressive system.Nah in the 1950’s for white people it really was the american dream. If we could go back to that with all the obvious social changes life would be great.Capitalism isn’t different in 2021 compared to 1970.how so? There were no super centers payday loan shops around every corner concentrated media ownership and uh no Amazon. Seems way more different to me.All the post-depression era investment banking regulations were removed in the 80s so the US could bankrupt communist countries. It’s gotten worse from there.It’s gotten way more efficient at separating the Haves from the Have Nots and eroding the pathways upwards.  In the US at least.The difference is its turning into late stage capitalism and starting to crumble.Hard disagree. Tax structure has drastically changed resulting in larger and larger economic disparity between the top and bottom. It's a totally different ball game.I think I see your point. It was the beginning before it started to erode and reveal the inevitability that it couldn’t be sustainable.I’m doing ok but I work my ass off every day pandemic or no pandemic.   I worked when forbidden to work.   I took a pay cut and back to normal some didn’t and there out of job. whatever works for you!*pulls out gun*\s\sYep. Always has been.Capitalism 1880 went full swing basicallyBy ""the economy"" do they mean Wall Street?  Because Wall Street isn't the economy.Weddings are a scam just like diamond rings. I'd rather spend the money on a holiday or a houseVery true. My wife and I ordered our wedding bands and her engagement ring online for less than $100 (we did our research to make sure they were legit and wold last - no real diamonds). Our wedding cost $35 but that was only to rent chairs for guests. It was ""officiated"" by a friend who isn't ordained or licensed but we got married by a court approved lady a couple days later. It was all catered with desserts and coffee made by my MIL and decorated with fairy lights we already had and bamboo that grew around our property. I have some friends from college that do photo shoots part time. They did our photos for super fuckin cheap.\s\sFor both of us it was 100% worth it even with her mom continually saying we're likely to regret downsizing for whatever reason at the time.Even better go on vacation and buy some sort of local ring from wherever you go. That way it has sentimental value.Save yourself before its to late and just dont get married.Dumbest mistake I ever made.  Money troubles during marriage are a HUGE cause of divorce. Why hobble yourself with blowing what should be the foundation of a successful loving partnership which is already hard?   We choose to make everything hard into something harder.Holiday it is then. Because Wallstreet Hedge Funds are literally making it impossible for you to ever own a home.  People know this right?  Hedge Funds are working hard to buy up ALL the housing in the US. They plan to become everyone's landlord for eternity.My wife and I decided to do a destination wedding and actually ended up spending way less then if we had done a local wedding.  \s\sThe best part most of the money we did spend was for the experience and fun of the vacation and the getting married part was kind of just a side event to the whole thing. \s\sIt was honestly money extremely well spent and a 2 week vacation I will always cherish.So true the best wedding I ever attended was a backyard BBQ. The most sincere and intimate ceremony I had ever witnessed.I hate how much I want a wedding and a ring.My wife told me I wasn't allowed to buy her a diamond ring; she wanted a big flatscreen TV :)I had an absolutely amazing wedding. Held it at the Lodge in Whitefish MT. Week long honeymoon had a hot tub it was fantastic. Figured out around that time that my Mom basically only gave a fuck about herself and cut her out of my life. My wedding was the best thing to ever happen to me.  \s\s\sIt also wasn't 100% my decision. My wife really wanted one her mom was all about it (and helped cover it as did her dad) her family is huge so it was the only way to get them all together. I mean it's cool if you think you wanna spend it on a holiday or house but that won't just be your choice. Every woman wants a wedding with very rare exceptions. It's the one day they get to dress up like a disney princess and have everyone fawn all over them. It's cruel to say ""I want to take that away because that's a societal expectation"". Fuck so's marriage.My wife and I got married at the San Diego waterfront courthouse in a beautiful garden under a gazebo right in front of the ocean for $85.  Then we spent $2500 renting a mansion with a pool tennis courts hot tub basketball court in La Jolla and $750 on alcohol and food catering.  We invited 30 of our best friends and closest family to party for a weekend went on a brewery tour hung out at the beach.  It was fucking dope and we actually got to spend time with the people we love rather than blowing past everyone casually at a shitty rushed reception.  100% would recommend that approach over a traditional wedding every time.Can we kill the bull shit engagement ring industry too?\s\sIt was a tradition started by diamond sellers.\s\shttps://youtu.be/N5kWu1ifBGULegit. Wife and I bought each other plain silver wedding bands for $100 each. Neither of us feels like that was a compromise in any way.I never understood why the engagement rings aren’t just used again as the wedding rings. Me and my partner are likely to have a long engagement so will get rings and then just reuse them when we decide to get marriedI'm so sick of low class people forcing their culture on the rest of us. Shut the fuck up and buy a rock.You can have a perfectly beautiful wedding on a budget. \s\sHate this crass commercialism trying to infect all the most meaningful moments of our lives.>You can have a perfectly beautiful wedding if you rely on free labor/supplies/venues from others.\s\sFTFYtaking loan just for wedding fuck that shitI mean I have a really big family (like 20 aunts and uncles and about 40 cousins) as does my girlfriend.  They all have invited us to their weddings so just food and a place to host everyone is going to be a fortune.  Then you need to factor in alcohol because anyone who doesn't provide some kind of beer or liquor at a wedding is a sadist and both our family's drink like sailors.  Just that is going to cost us well over $5000.  In total a wedding for us would cost probably over 10k more money than I have ever had in my life.Idk I was considering it.  I won't have to now but if you can get a good interest rate on the loan why sell assets?\s\sLike I could take out a 1% loan on crypto holdings or low interest loan on 401k or cash out refi or home equity loan.  The interest rate for all of that would be less than the 7-15% that my assets are appreciating.The fucking wedding-industrial complex.  My wife and I always had the theory (never tested) that if we tried to book the same event venue on the same day same # of people same menu etc. but gave them 2 separate reasons (wedding vs. surprise 75th birthday for mom for example) we’d get vastly different prices.  \s\sDon’t take out loans for a wedding!  It truly is such an important day…which you will NOT remember between the blur of activity and alcohol.  Spend what you can afford (N.B. Just because you can PAY for it doesn’t mean you can AFFORD it) and have fun!I am pretty sure a news program in Canada called “Marketplace” did that exact thing a few years ago. And you’re exactly correct the up charge was insane.Oh this is true. Not a theory but true.A lot of the upcharge is due to higher expectations for weddings. If you’re working a corporate event it doesn’t matter if some things don’t go perfectly. It’s one event of many. If you’re working a wedding it’s (supposed to be) the couple’s only wedding so everything has to be perfect. Word of mouth is essential for wedding vendors and one bad review can really hurt business.\s\sAlso wedding event contracts usually include a lot more than regular event contracts.Nude wedding & a ring - problem solvedThat's a scam just order in some food service and BYOB. My grandfather just did his at a park and had a brick oven pizza truck show up and cook pizzas.Love this - most days I’d rather have pizza than have to gamble if I’ll like whatever dish on a menu with only 3 options they have prepared. Fresh pizza will make even the sourest person happy.We had a small destination wedding for less than 5k and it was perfect. Fuck spending tens of thousands of dollars! I mean if you have the means to do so go for it but going into debt for a party is insane.This is the way to go. Budget and have a small gathering with only immediate family and very close friends. It’ll be expensive but it won’t be those ridiculous 50k+ weddings that are mostly unnecessary. \s\s\sA lot of people still want to have a wedding and that’s ok. People act like you either want a big expensive thing or you have to go completely without. As usual people on the internet pretend a middle ground doesn’t exist. Weirdo behaviorPicnic in the park. Stack of good pizza and a bunch of wine. Done.I think the best thing that came out of Covid for my sister and her husband was an excuse to do a courthouse weddingMy spouse and I did a courtroom wedding with like our most important family as witnesses no dresses for either of us and took a few selfies and had chicken and cake back at our apartment. The rings were a hand-me-down and a fairly cheap metal band. Marriage certificate food and rings together it was maybe 400 dollars\s\sGoing on 4 years and can't get enough of each other. We plan to have a slightly nicer version for our 5th anniversary and have a friend renew our vows with our friends present at a friend's house.GenX here.  Got married on the beach.  Exchanged rings we bought for $70 from an old aircraft machinist who turned them in his garage.  Had a nice BBQ and ended up paying for a honeymoon with the generous gifts from our friends.Add it to the list of things that are important to boomers that help them but fuck everyone else.Millennials are pushing 40.Well half of them are. The other half are in their early 30's and late 20's.I kinda want to get married in my Uncles backyard. He has a nice house and a pool.  Would cut down on a lot of costs.You want to marry your uncle?You should! I bet he'd be honored to host your wedding.>can we kill the wedding industry next?\s\s\sAt this point most millenials are either married or in their nth relationship. Let Gen-Z'ers do that.Fuck weddings. Everything about them. Fuck em.This is predatory capitalism by banks not by the wedding industry.  While I support the intent @uppittynegress is a few paper straws short of opening a lemonade standDon’t worry we dont even have time for friends and familyMy husband and I's ""wedding"" cost us $150. And we don't wear rings. We've been married 6 years and together going on 12 years 👏👏😝We are making our wedding cheap by renting an AirBNB in a nice location and doing it there with a friend as our ordained minister. So much better then renting a venue and all the other fees.Well if they are dumb enough to go into debt for a shitty education they are dumb enough to go into debt for a wedding.Me and my fiance literally are just gonna have a pagan wedding outside and stay away from wedding planners.You dumb fucks tradition says it’s the girls parents who pay this shit. You never go into debt for a marriage.\s\sThey insist on “tradition” then lie to you about this specific one!! All or nothing I say.Got married on a boat. 50 bucks a head for prime rib or chicken. Lasted a little over four hours. Took our son home. He napped then we passed out with bellies full of wedding cheesecake. My pull out game was weak but im happy.Never really understood it in life or romance that a wedding is needed no fuck that you can make morgage payments.Literally a part in Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle. They decide to have a wedding party and further cripples their finances.Already did my part. We got married in a nice patio at our favorite restaurant with a JP and a photographer. Our parents flew out and were the only guests. Only condition was we had to eat lunch there which we wanted to do anywayI love a good jacket potato.Don't forget the divorce statistics...chances are you will hate them and want them to die in a radioactive shark attack before you have paid off the wedding/honey moon.....They already got me on student loans. For the wedding I refused to pay more than we could reasonably afford out of pocket. We got married in our apartment and had our reception in my mom’s party room which was pretty nice. 10 ppl at the wedding 30 total for reception. Spent about $1500 USD for everything but it’s still more than I wanted to spend (husband didn’t want to do courts).Awesome idea!Jesus Christ that doesn’t even try to hide its venomous intent.  “I know the price is unfathomable but just do it anyway and do it in a way that multiplies the cost even further!”\s\sLike really?  I mean just… really!?Hey millennials let us scam you.Yes let’s all go take out more loans for any and all expense surely eventually everything will be alright in the end right?Been BF and GF for 8 years.  No contract required so no need for the institution of marriage.  No kids to burden us to death either.Got married in a courthouse\sHad a blowout of a honeymoon in San Fransisco and only paid less than 1000 for both our rings! \sBeen having a blast for 7 years straight!I’m killing the absolute shit out out of my wedding originally our reception was going to $33k base +extras and $12k for flowers (fake) \s\sMy partner and I decided to cancel the big reception venue and use the money to take the wedding party to Disney world for a few weeks as our reception. \s\sStill cheaper and we will be flying from Australia.How about not destroying every tradition?How old is the tradition of weddings costing tens of thousands?Hey everyone!\s\sThis guy is going to pay for all our weddings!\s\sHe is willing to go bankrupt to preserve a tradition.Since when is taking out a loan part of the wedding tradition? None of my elder relatives did that.Just because it’s traditional does not make it something that should be done.noThe tradition being overpriced weddings? You can still have a wedding without going into debt.you can thank capitalism for that.\s\sI mean not all of capitalism just this bastard American version where the rich get bailed out and the young get taken advantage of.The celebration is the tradition not the insane costs that have inflated around it on ever-skyrocketing expectations. Do you take loans out for vacation too genius?The tradition is a nice wedding\s\sThe tradition doesn’t have to include getting a loan that you’ll be paying longer than your marriageHow about understanding you've been manipulated to think this is a valued tradition when it's really been taught to you that it's mandatory.You can have a much more traditional wedding thats going to be much more cheaper. Problem is the ladies aint going to like it.So bride's parents will pay30%? Try 50% in major cities.yeah in NYC have studio half my take home goes to rent and I know I’m fairly well off compared to most.Try 0% of this topic living in my head.There are limited jobs in the places you can afford it. And…people in NYC need to be able to afford their homes. \s\sThat’s like saying “if you think shelf sticking is t paying enough get a different job.”  Someone needs to do that job and they should be paid a living wage.Imagine a town full of nurses lmao. And another one where everybody is just sweeping the streets.Just take a walk up and down Colfax Ave. in Denver. 70% of those tents in Denver are people born and raised in the city but once Denver boomed they couldn't afford to live there once the trust fund hippies all moved inColfax Wazee Logan Speer all of ballpark/downtown.\s\sThe homelessness here is unlike anything I've ever seen.Happened to my town. Rent is over 50% of my income. \s\s  \sIt used to be a working class town now it's a playground for rich liberalsI pay +50% of my income and always haveUnfortunately I’m in the same boat :/In an econ class in junior high in the early 80s the teacher said that your total household expenses (rent/mortgage utilities food the whole shebang) should be no more than 25% of your monthly income. I laughed at him and he couldn’t understand why. Then he told us that he had bought his house in the 60s so his mortgage was something ridiculous like $125/month. I told him that my and my mom’s rent was over triple that. (Nearly 40 years ago so I don’t remember the actual numbers but I do remember that our rent was triple his mortgage.)And people like that make the fucking legislation.Over 30%? r/technicallythetruthMan I live in London as a 20 year old and my rent is about 70% of my incomeWhy? Share a place.\s\sIm 20 too and in London and my rent is 25% of my post tax income because I have housemates. \s\sI invest the majority of it each month.30% my ass!might be 1 or 2 more reasons let me thinkOkay but now do the driver of housing costs.I live in a share house cause I’m way too broke to live alone & my rent is still 48%I’m basically living in the cheapest studio in town that has a private bathroom and it costed nearly 75% of my net monthly income. If someone pitches we socialize housing and tell landlords to go fuck themselves with barbed wire they get my vote forever.How fucking brain dead does someone actually have to be to not inherently understand that last line. bruh if you have to pay more for it then less people will have it???? Like wtf?Yupseriously though. sometimes single moms without any income want to go live in LA and that really makes me laugh. some places aren't right for your budget. that's just the reality.30% lmao try 55%$500 a month for a townhouse in Illinois[deleted]Cornfields illinois or near civilization?Just a few amendments would do wonders to this countryNot even amendments just laws:\s\s* Congress people get only 2 terms.\s* Election day is now a federal holiday.\s* Repeal Citizen's United.\s\sThe another one should be a way to make nonvoters more interested in actually voting. Incentivize voting with maybe a tax credit maybe give people a small credit that can be used to donate to campaigns they like. You canalso  make voting mandatory like in some countries (which I think is 100% fine as long as there is a ""no""/write-in choice when it comes to picking candidates; people deserve the right to say that all the candidates suck and do not appeal to them).Good luck. Those in power will never voluntarily give it up.Problem is 2/3 of states would need to ratify themAs long as the USA continues with systems where those who have the power to change the rules are the same people who stand to benefit from those rule changes there will be no truly fair elections \s\sAs someone who lives in a country with an independent electoral commission the idea that state representatives would have any say in the specifics of how federal elections are run or how electoral boundaries are drawn is one of the dumbest things I have ever heardThe whole Country was bought and sold for 40 years ago and nobody even cared. Hardly anyone cares now. as long as they get their stimmy it's all fun and dandy.I hate election season because of the ads. The nonsense both sides spew off. EwwwNo campaign financing\s\sIf you give money to someone running for or staffed in a public office then it should be a crimeAnd guess which half does most of the voting.I thought my country was the same as the country on the right but what a relief only individuals can donate and it's 1k limit too.\s\sI guess that's why Trudeau had to resort to ""speaking fees"" to get his fix of institutional sponsor money.One can hopeThe politicians aren't going to take $$ out of their own pockets.…. I’m not disagreeing with the sentiment but those numbers on the American side are complete nonsense.Okay what are the actual numbers?If they fixed it then they couldn't scrape all those sweet sweet dollars from the system to line their pockets.Yeah but look into what party takes dark money. Democrats are grass roots funded while republicans rely solely on corporations.Oh the Dems are equal opportunity grifters though the GOP is responsible for Citizens United which tainted every election afterward.  They're both greedy.Ok sure Norway has it way better but if the corporations use their political puppets to make this happen how are they going to turn any popular candidate into a puppet?  Like damn let us be corrupt in peaceAmerica needs complete reform that only bills like the American Anti-Corruption Act can provide. Or at least pass the For the People Act and some other laws to kill Citizen's United and first-past-the-post votingIs this implying that Norway is socialist?Norway is known for so many great thingsIn Cuba elections are 0% funded by corporations candidates are nominated by communities and not parties and they have 90% to 98% average voter turnout. Everybody from ages 16 and up can vote and run for local and district office and anyone 18 and up can run for national office. We need our system to look like that.Wait you guys have to pay for tests?  \s\s125 dollars? 800 freaking dollars?!\s\sI've been tested more times than I can count absolutely nothing out of pocket. We can buy our own small rapid antigen tests in supermarkets for less than 5 dollars here. What the fuck.Capitalism gone wild. The US is literally eating its own people alive.The rapid antigen tests are free in the UK all pharmacists have them and you can order them online. Weeks worth in a box grab one per household member.Tests are free. Rapid tests cost $$$I live in NJ and have been tested at least 6 times and never paid once. I have insurance too. \s\sThe $125 out of pocket price is probably the price to see the doctor at the clinic (I’m an X-ray tech and used to work at an urgent care that charged that much to anyone without insurance) \s\sI honestly could not answer your question. I don’t know where these people are going where they are paying $782 for a covid test.My household in Texas has had a total of 15 tests over the last year and a half and we haven’t paid a dime. Some were rapid others weren’t.In Germany antigen tests cost under a euro in the supermarket or pharmacyWhy get tested so often? Work requirements?Imagine paying for a Covid-test...\s\s\sThis was brought to you by the Scandinavian welfare gangHonestly as a swede I'd rather pay around 1000 kronor than giving most of my paycheck away to the government.MuricaDamn. It’s free in my state.Wait I live in America. COVID tests cost money?No. https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.htmlIt’s free as fuck in Texas i just did one 2 days agoThis is fake. Walgreens CVS and Walmart do tests for free in my US town. All three offer free vaccines as well.Just had the rapid vivid test.  It was $150.\s\sThe clinic I went to yesterday was advertising free test a few months ago. Now they are no longer free.I paid 150$ for a test in February when I was leaving the country. 800$ seems a bit of a stretch however unless there are other factors involved.Different areas of the country are pulling out of emergency mode at different speeds.  It may be fake where you are but it isn't fake everywhere.Uhh wtf? I can throw a rock here in California and hit at least 3 free testing sitesThe rest of the country as well.  It's free if you tell them you were potentially exposed or have symptoms.  You might have to pay if you need a negative test to travel.Usually out of pocket costs MORE— since insurance providers pre-negotiate prices.Its the same thing with any insurance claim. Wreck ur car? Shop is going to charge an insane amount for every little thing and probably with a mark up. Roof damage on ur house? That company is going to rape insurance. Hail damage on ur car? Hell these guys will even pay ur deductible and give you cash back! Why? They’re going to over charge the insurance company and make a huge profit. These ppl wouldn’t be in business charging fair prices.In Germany Rapid Tests are free. I work in a Covid test center near Ramstein AirBase and everyone that has a valid ID is allowed to be tested for free.Wait Ramstein is a state/province? I thought it was just that crazy ass metal bandWhat did the union insurance pay because I’m in a union and they pay like 10% of what they’re billed.What the fuck is wrong in your country i can buy covid tests in my nation's equivalent of walmart for under 5 bucksRich ppl wanting to get richerMost covid tests in america are free….  Not sure where this person took theres… but when most of that is free lets focus on something worse like insulin costing some americans an arm and a leg to live..Can’t have positive cases if people can’t afford it...Lmao the us really sucksI think this an super old tweet at the beginning of the pandemic. I hate it when people crop the dates of tweets.Lol you have to pay to get tested? That’s tucking outrageous!Tucking right!This is the result of running a health system that uses profit as its primary motive.Even my country's neolib government made covid testing free for everyone why would you be made to do that.Covid testing is free in the US but Not the rapid ones.Source? Articles?Don’t liberals really like unions?So it's the unions fault private clinics massively overcharge insurances?Can any of you fucking people read? We spent 3.2 trillion on healthcare IN 2018. 450 BILLION IS THE ESTIMATED YEARLY SAVINGSAnyone with a basic understanding of governance and economics knows that is a bullshit number. There is no magic savings and government is never more efficient. To actualize that amount of savings hundreds of thousands or millions of administrative jobs will be cut pay will be cut for providers such as nurses and doctors and services deemed (unnecessary) will be eliminated. Stop perpetuating lies and be honest about what Universal Coverage means BuT iT wILl HeLp PeOpLe after it wrecks the economy first. Oh but at least corporations will gain immensely by no longer having to pay for their employee coverage.In this thread we're getting hung up on numbers rather than ""Healthcare should be a priority bombing a dirt poor country should not be.""\s\sWe always find excuses to avoid the conclusion that killing people because of political disagreements is bad and our citizens being less poor is good.\s\sYou can say it'll cost a lot more to heal everyone than bombing Afghanistan but that's missing the forest for the trees. We tried the thing that was impossible and also stupid (making Afghanistan) and not the thing that most other countries have done that also is by the way GOOD. Why is that? We didn't compare prices and say ""Yeah we can only afford Afghanistan.""\s\sWe're letting the healthcare and military industrial complex get absurdly wealthy here for no valid reason we don't even question them.450 billion a year? That's insane. Is it that expensive?No that's 450B saved every year.\s\sThe US spends more on healthcare per capita than any other developed nation.Right? Like we did spend 2 trillion but over the course of 20 years. \s\sThis would be like 4x the amount we spent on the wars. Which I’m all for but still2 trillion over 20 years? That’s a deal lolIKR. That's just $100 billion/year which is absolutely tiny considering that 2021 has already added $10 trillion to the debt.This is wrong. Canada (Population of 38M spends 290B/year on healthcare so 7k CAD per person. so the US would be around 3T/y. Still not that crazy considering the GDP is like 30T and it would actually help people.I think you read it wrong. It’s “save” not “spend” $450B/year.If we matched the per capita spending of Canada we'd drop from $3.8 trillion per year (as of 2019) to $1.8 trillion. Even adjusting for purchase power parity it would still be far less than $3 trillion per year....and yet we're over $30 trillion in debt. I realize that sometimes it's necessary to go into debt as a long-term investment such as getting the economy back on track via stimulus money unemployment etc. but the current spending is already over $10 trillion for this year; universal healthcare is just an impossibility at our scale. It might work in a tiny country like the UK with 1/5 of our population and where everyone lives so closely together but it would be a logistical nightmare in the U.S.America where our greatest fear is having someone get something that we think they don't deserve.It’s almost like The Americans don’t add salt to their food. They’ve grown so numb and can’t even question their politicians by voting them out if office for the world’s worst healthcare pricing and insane lack of public transportation.[deleted]You are misunderstanding. The key word is “save.” We spend well over $3 Trillion/year on healthcare right now.Isn’t 450bill like a little over 2 years to hit 2 trill?All I want is a living wage but that's too much to ask for apparently.There's another way one that can take back the time effort and wealth stolen from us by the few for the benefit of the many. We just need to band together and fight for what's rightfully ours. You don't have to scrape by you can have a better world if your labor isn't taken from you and you can work for the benefit of all instead of the few. Consider socialism.Always ask 4 at least $2 per Hour more than you want. Bosses are always trying to make money. So when the low ball you and you except they feel like they got a deal. But if you ask for $2 more you both win. Most businesses want a 300% return.Because we are losing.We know who stole our taxes from us how they they did it and they're still around with their ill-gotten gains. Time to claw back our taxes from those who stole it.If they give us a thriving wage some of us won't come back next week or next month for the next paycheck.

The Nixon campaign in 1968 and the Nixon White House after that had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying?\sWe knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders raid their homes break up their meetings and vilify them night after night on the evening news. \sDid we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”Something something.... Taxation without representation... Something somethingThis was exploited in the 2000 election in Florida.

I did one for an HIV vax back in 2004. Got paid $250 upon signing and $50 for every follow up visit (every 2-3 weeks for about a year). Keep in mind this was almost 20 yrs ago. The only bad effect I had was forgetting to tell my OB about it and my HIV antibody test popped positive. Viral load was zero though so it was just the vax.FactualOr its a vaccine for the poor and saline solution for the elite that get the vaccine on TV.

Therefore it is fact…Oh yes. How else did we get birth control approved?There’s quite a precedent of thisOk but we’ve disavowed large swaths of the global south no access to the vaccine......How can you be sure politicians have taken it? The Mayor of London was photographed supposedly having his flu jab and the cap was still on the needle!I guarantee that the people pushing against the vaccine are vaccinated.Knowing my governmentI wouldn't be surprised.I don't know if this is legit but [kamala harris seems to have feigned the shot](https://www.wakeupyahdaim.com/now-the-global-coronavirus-pandemic-scare/) (19th image (actually a video))Yes.This feels like the stuff of r/conspiracyThey cry about the ""long term affects"" as if covid doesn't give you smoker lungs and other damageI wanna see video proof of billionaires getting the vaccineI can’t believe I didn’t think of this as an argument\s\sThanks OP!![deleted]You’ve been lied to.  Question your sources.Where the fuck did you get this from? Even the politicians and media personalities telling people to not get the vaccine have itThey've literally all taken it along with their families.Even many GOP politicians who are spreading misinformation about the covid-19 vaccines have taken it including Trump *ages ago.* They were some of the first people to take it once it was proven safe.Very true. The politicians that got it on camera How can we really know for sure if they didn't just get a saline shot? The only politician that I can say absolutely got it is the Aussie politician because he got bells palsy right afterwards.Politicians and billionaires didn’t get it first every country prioritized by age and health factors.Politicians and billionaires didn’t need to get it first they could afford healthcare that would heal them quickly if they caught covid.Yes almost all of the worlds politicians and billionaires are generally borderline geriatric.And yet cities broke protocol and politicians began taking the vaccine regardless. There was a lot of well deserved backlash for it last year.In Ecuador at least Rotary club members and politicians and their families were among the first to get it. There was a big scandal about it. I can't imagine the even richer greedier american billionaires wouldn't have tried to use their power to jump the lin.It’s been documented that Trump managed to get his buddies Covid vaccine before everyone else as well as new experimental Covid treatments that were not available to the general public.I listen to the people qualified to talk about the vaccine. Like Dr. Karry Mullis (inventer of the RT/PCR test) Dr. Mike Yeadon (Former VP of Pfizer and chief virologist) and Dr. Robert Malone (Inventor or the mRNA Vavvine technology). You won't find anyone higher in their Respective fields of knowledge.Ok and what do they say about itPoor people are much easier to control they want to kill off the middle to upper middle classWell they're doing a poor job of it by vaccinating them against a deadly virus.No.Shit it’s true.\s\s2021  - 1492 = 529 years.\s\s529 years * 365.25 days per year = 193217.25 days\s\s193217.25 days * 5000 per day = 966 millionI’m really not so caught up with the world. I did that same math and was surprised at how low the total is. Well… low because I googled how much Bezos makes *in a week:* $2.25 billion. I’m not sure how I feel about this I need to go lay downAnd still true for another 18.5 years….r/theydidthemathYou have to eat too.That's a disturbing factThat is why we need a more pro-small business climate so all kinds of people can start their own business instead of just working to death.\s\sOn the other hand the “wealth” of Bezos is caused by expectation of values of Amazon not because Amazon is churning out that kind of cash daily. Elizabeth Holmes the lady that created Theranos was valued for billions of dollars despite not having a working product/service at all. Amazon still have working service Theranos didn’t have anything.The thing is that Bezos (and other billionaires like him) can sell of bits of their stock to get an infusion of cash - in 2020 Bezos sold off about $10bn in Amazon stock. Which is still several lifetimes' worth of luxury and comfort and it's equivalent to an ATM withdrawal for him.\s\sFurther they can leverage their assets including their stock as collateral for massive tax-free cash loans. Meanwhile their net worth is constantly growing faster than they can ever hope to spend it so even after paying back the loan + interest they still come out on top.\s\sSo in practical terms the wealth of billionaires *can* function as if they have it all in cash. In essence Jeff Bezos has unlimited wealth.Well then you tell us what Jeff has in the bank and we'll start there.Exactly we need a bunch of small businesses rather than a few mega corps. But no one is confused on the fact that wealth isn't dollars on hand. People always point this out but everyone knows.Definitely a mind-blowing statistic but if I can make it a little less mind-blowing for some I feel I have to.\s\sat an extremely modest 3% interest rate (these days it'd be reasonable to assume 10%) you would currently be worth $474364000000000 or 474 trillion dollars. The only way you would not be a billionaire is by never using a cent of the money over 400+ years. To be a billionaire in this hypothetical would be every single day since 1492 making 1 cent and 5/100 cents.\s\sHard to think about a dollar being worth more twenty years ago than how much a dollar is worth now but that's a quirk of money.This is true but misses the point. The idea isn't a literal ""this is how much money you'd have"" it's a contextualization of ""this is how much a billion dollars actually is"".I’ll take those odds anyway. Can’t hurt to try right?Jfc dude. You will never ever be a billionaire. You are closer to abject poverty than you will ever be to being a wealth hoarder.If you bought 100k of Coca-Cola stock during the IPO and invested all the dividends do you kkow how much you would have today? $1216512000000\s\sSIMPLETON the wealth is not salary it is appreciation\s\sI know military guys in cali late 30s that are millionaires because they bought crap houses 20 years ago that have gone up 450%+  in 20 years.\s\sstop whining.Where's the initial 100k coming from fucknuts?No one said it was salary you goofy bitch. Go back to licking billionaire jizz of your shirt collar and stfu.""SIMPLETON""\s\sYou pedantic old fart. You're assuming that people have 100k to invest which is more than the median net wealth in America. \s\sYou're also assuming people would have invested in a stock with high returns versus any of the hundreds of stocks that have gone belly up the past few decades. \s\sRead a fucking book.\s\s""late 30s that are millionaires""\s\sLiterally a factor of 1000 less than a billion lmao. It's the difference between having a thousand dollars and a million.A pointless fact.   Jeff Bezos doesn’t earn much money otherwise he would have to pay income taxes.  \sEven Columbus knew he had to make a return on his investment and he didn’t as he was looking for a shortcut and then primarily gold.  So his voyages were considered financial failures. \sColumbus would have over $1 Trillion if he made an annual return of just 3%.   And that’s why you will always be poor because you focus on the wrong thing!   It’s not what Jeff Bezos does it’s what you do.  \sAnd all you do doesn’t help you or anyone else. \sSo focus on making a difference helping others and it will change your life.   Jeff Bezos started by simply selling books.  Helping others get books they wanted.  \sHe had Barnes and Noble and several other big name books stores to compete against.   So don’t say it’s different now!   \sA local guy started a coffee bistro in an abandoned building no drive through.   He renovated it started serving coffee and expanded his offerings. Several years later a Dunkin’ donuts opened across the street with a drive thru.   A few years later They built a plaza behind him with a huge Starbucks with a drive thru.\sI heard the local guy sold out to retire but his coffee shop is still there thriving.   So don’t say it can’t be done! \sBut all you can do is search for memes and you probably didn’t even make one and you throw stones at others.  The problem is the mirror has the same guy looking back at you all the time!Yeah folks just keep working harder on that minimum-wage job of yours and you will eventually become millionaires! I bet you can even afford your own 1-bedroom apartment before you turn 250.\s\sSpread this guy’s wisdom: WORK HARDER and you can achieve ANYTHING yay!!!!\s\sEdit: if you are already working hard then you are the problem. You should be working HARDER.Steve what is it like to be completely in the thrall of some fucking asshole making GDP-level passive income? Does your pussy get wet?> It’s not what Jeff Bezos does it’s what you do.\s\sno it's what Jeff Bezos doesn't do that is the problem.\s\sJeff Bezos doesn't pay his workers a fair wage\s\sJeff Bezos doesn't pay his taxes\s\sJeff Bezos steals from a society that made him rich hoards not just wealth but economic growth. He does so while maintaining a work force that relies on social services to provide the work to grow his wealth. \s\sso yeah it matters. \s\sPersonally I skipped the whole minimum wage thing entirely and went straight to making solid salary money at about 25. But it's not about me and it's not about you it's about how the policies our society pursues encourage and discourage various behaviors and outcomes. \s\sacting like the attitudes of individuals are more important than the policies that frame their communities is just stupid. like so stupid. honestly it's hard for me to understand how someone could  think something that stupid. my guess is that it comes down to almost complete ignorance about the world and a massively oversized self imagePauper to billionares is just that. One lucky individual over million of other. There no way he is the most hard working or the most intelligent and no way he is both of them at once. There no tried and true method to getting rich than being at the right place at the right time and having the right assets. You can get decently off working hard and play the game but you wont be Jeff Bezos level of playing the game from it alone. And who say they let you up there in the first place? Why would anyone who amass that amount of assets basically a dragon hoard care to share it with anyone? The elite will make the rules to keep other from reaching the same height. It been proven time and time again that has not for the pride of being remembered to have a legacy to be etched into the history book- no rich person would give any of the wealth away to anyone but themselves. You dont get there by being generous or being fair. Getting rich in capitalism is just a long con at the  expense of everyone else rich or poor. You trick the rich to part with their investment you rob the masses of their earning. In an industry where you reach the ceiling of profit where else to go but to cut corner and salary then pretend like it is some genius level play that no one else but you can think of it? When your money in excess where else do you put it but to buy up land and industry and sit on your ass doing nothing basically robbing others of opportunities to use it to drive artificial scarcity so you can mark up the prices? Where else do you put your money but buying politician and lawyer so that you can vouch law that oppress new ideas so that you can bought them for cheap after their creator unable to make a living out of a market where you unofficially control? Where else do you put your money but swindling the stock market so that you can artificially make money out of thin air but actually from unfortunate investor that is only investing because you bought every single reccomendations that been given to them to vouch for you? So on and so on. Its isnt smart or hard work that get anyone there. Its exploitation exploitation upon exploitation in a poker game that 90% dont know how to play dont want to play but got to participate anyway and only you and a luck few know the winning hand and willing to cheat for it.I don't even necessarily disagree about the whole service aspect of what you are saying. However this mentality is still assuming a meritocratic aspect to economy which even if present still just ends up congealing into an oppressive ideation.Lmao had to expand your negative karma comment to see this.

That’s dentists lawyers small business owners software engineers private practice doctors… actual working people that went to college. Your problem is with 0.001%’ersgotta disagree.

WORK WORK WORK!!!Homie doesn’t understand that outliers can heavily skew mean averages. Take billionaires and  hundred millionaires out of the equation and I promise that that 78k/year average plummets .\sSo which is your favorite flavor of boot?Family incomes has risen on average but mean averages give a stronger weight to outliers than is accurate to explaining the “average” situation. The mean average between you me and bill gates is a billionaire but only one of three are billionaires. \s\sAlso median wages (the wage in the middle) have only risen 17% since 1979 during a period that saw a 62% increase in productivity. But from 1948-1979 median wages grew 107% while productivity rose 118%. So during the during the post war boom and era of New Deal government there was an average of roughly 2.6% yearly increase in productivity and 2.4% in wages. But in the following 51 years since the dominance of neoliberalism and small government policies those have shrunk to 0.9% in yearly productivity growth and 0.3% in yearly wage growth. \s\sThe era of rampant capitalism has been an era of slowed growth in productivity and wages but the gap is still clear as wage growth is significantly smaller than productivity growth. The wealthiest have stolen the difference. \s\sThe median wage is $36000 but the average worker product is $136000. “Mr Capitalism” is taking the difference in the SNP 500 companies on average spent 52% of net income on stock buybacks and a further 39% on dividends. It seems pretty clear that the workers make it and the wealthy take it.\s\s78% of workers live pay check to paycheck and 36% would have difficulty paying an emergency $400 expense.Working class Americans are hurting and they deserve better.> and growing\s\sIs it growing beyond the rate of inflation? If so please provide evidence for this claim.Do Americans win more money on average compared to their Canadians and European counterparts? Yes. Americans also end up saving a lot less of their money due to our Healthcare/Insurance costs and Housing costs. For example in Germany the Government controls the housing prices so that way anyone that wants to buy a home can. They also have Universal healthcare which is a lot cheaper than ours per capita due to Government regulation and incentives.All I hear is people complaining about others wealth as the old adage goes ""the first million is the hardest"" and that is very accurate.indeed the system we live under has proven itself a failure on every level that matters and should be done away with.Problem is it's not a failure for the people that have the most power to change it.This is literally the premise of the Declaration of Independence.The system we live under works but time and time again citizens have gotten lazy about how to utilize their power.  Your representative isnt doing the job you want or making good on their promises?  Vote them out-- organize a petition to remove them if necessary.  The problem is that most  representatives arent as afraid of their voters as they should or used to be.  We are easy to divide frustrate and make complacent and thus easier for people with money to control.\s\sVoting and organizing is our collective power and was the way this country was founded.  It is WE the people who have failed in our pursuits to hold officials accountable.  We have the country we deserve at the moment.Sooooooooo what do you recommend as a better system?""\[...\] whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of \[Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\] it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government.""The founders did a great job of marketing the idea of our country but a slaver writing ""all men are created equal"" and claiming that everyone has the right to Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness while doing jack shit to set slaves free feels like a giant grift to me.  \sIf we truly had the right to life then universal healthcare wouldnt be up for a debate.\sIf we truly had the right to Liberty then homeless people sleeping in their own cars would not be arrested and we could legally camp on any unused land like people can in Norway as long as they stay 50 meters from oersonal houses. Over there if a rich asshole buys an entire forest the people are still allowed to explore and camp in it. That is true freedom.\sIf we had the right to pursue happiness then college would be free for every kid. If all kids are created equal then they all deserve an equal chance to go to a trade school or college.r/maliciouscompliance : )The system is working exactly how it’s supposed to for the people in power. American has become an oligarchy.True.  An oligarchy is when the rich run the governent as their own.  And how do you threaten rich people?  Threaten their money.\s\sBoycotts work.  ""Cancel culture"" is just the negative spin phrase for mass boycotting.  It's the ONLY thing they listen to because we are the source of their wealth.Look what it did to you when you tried to fix it.  They're not just going to suddenly realize their mistake and lay down their broken toys.People are starting to understand that the government it's the only thing that legitimates the government.Because the people making all the profit under capitalism want it to remain. And even if the government won't step in and slap down dissidents the capitalists and their bought and paid for police will.Because it benefits the people who have the power to change it.Chelsea manning is attacking leftist journalists like glenn greenwald currently.\s\sIm not sure whats going on in their head.Glenn Greenwald has been a willing shill for the right wing propaganda machine for some time now.\s\sHe gets paid to say ""black lives matter"" is genocide and then right wing propaganda says  ""see?

The moratorium was put in place by legislators (which is how it’s supposed to happen) the Supreme Court is not the legislature they can’t make or extend laws. And it’s not their job to extend the duration of legislation.\s\sNow\s\sThe issue isn’t Dems\s\sThe issue is how the senate is run\s\sRepublicans \s\sAnd moderates.\s\sYou want change\s\sVote this shit away from government.Mostly correct but Dems can change Senate rules by a simple majority. You don't need any Republicans to get rid of the filibuster you just need Manchin and Sinema. \s\sYou can and should primary Sinema but you can't do shit about Manchin. \s\sThe SC blocked an eviction moratorium extension by the WH saying it requires legislative action. They weren't required to actively do anything to further the moratorium they proactively decided to stop it. Which is probably legal and that still brings you back to the Senate.This is a distinctly no shit lib area. Go be a shitlib elsewhere. The Dems have no legs to stand on.Lol the Dems and reps are the same party both disgust me anyone that thinks they are voting for the lesser of 2 evils ... Is the problemNo based on the ideology and policy of the Democratic Party of the past three decades they are absolutely the problem. Obviously the GOP is a problem but they are explicitly the party for the right wing for the capitalist mythologizers for the anti-tax austerity hawks.\s\sThe fact that the Dems functionally produce similar results by pretending to be powerless no matter how many seats and offices they hold proves that they are at the very least an intentional obstruction to progress of any kind and a barrier between us and democracy.What a brain dead stupid post. Equating both parties on these issues reflects a shallow ignorant intellectual laziness of grand proportions. Do you have any idea how the Senate works? Democrats control it by the absolute bare minimum. Subtract from their numbers at least two Dems that vote like republicons and they cannot get even a simple majority. Also the most important legislation requires a super majority. If have no patience for lazy fools like you.Those are excuses which will make losing the midterms a likelihood.\s\sThe voting public has no patience. Democrats can deliver or be voted out.\s\sSimple as that.You've just explained succinctly why this government cannot work structurally even under the best of conditions.\s\sThis is why electoralism is a waste of time and a joke. The democrats got almost the best case possible from 2020 (and historic voter turnout the highest in 120 years since 1900) and Biden and congress are doing jack shit. Police militarization is up more immigrants are being detained and now benefits are expiring for many marginalized people during a surging COVID. Oh also winter is on the horizon.\s\sMillions of marginalized people are going to suffer and the best response is ""umu we only have 50 seats instead of 60 oopsies"". Yea I guess it's the voters fault right? Smh. \s\sIt's time people stopped waiting every 2/4 years for some blind hope and start taking direct action. Squatting grey markets guerilla gardening decentralized unionization etc. Things that both Republican and Democrat administrations either kill subvert or appropriate into a statist nexus so the state can remain in power at the expense of the suffering of many. So yes I do equate them as antagonist to marginalized peoples.\s\sAll politicians harm marginalized people. In different ways and not uniformly but they all do.Who's surprised? Weapons makers make bigger campaign contributions.\s\sAverage Americans DON'T MATTER. Let me say it again; THEY DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU.\s\sAnd they never will until we all stand together.Except the reason nothing is getting done is because the Senate and House Republicans refuse to do anything good for normal Americans unless it will assist them politically.Honestly I'm glad this is happening.\sPeople can't suck the tit of the government to keep themselves alive anymore and will be forced to actually go out and work.I'm one of these ""lazy"" people you speak of. I am a working class independent contractor with a small business that was more than enough to keep me afloat before the pandemic. Struggling people are not lazy most work twice as hard as the people calling them lazy. Punching down is easy because acknowledging that somebody who works hard their whole life may never live abundantly or even be able to make ends meet is unfair and implies there may be a systemic problem when its much easier to say 9 million people are all exactly the same - lazy.\s\sI was somewhat disabled during the pandemic unrelated to covid but I worked through all of it. I needed the benefits because although I never stopped working my business was cut in half. Although down business was consistent throughout until the start of this year when I lost more business than I had for all nine months of the pandemic in '20. So now I'm working full-time hours for half what I was making with a debilitating chronic illness that isn't disabling enough (according to those not living with it) to qualify for any other type of assistance. \s\sI live in Texas too so unemployment was cut off in June but I've been without benefits since March. In March I was current on bills actively working to rebuild my business. Circumstances gave changed for a lot of people though so in June I lost 25% of my still reduced income and everything started to fall behind rapidly. By mid-July I had no money for groceries. All of August I've been eating cereal and peanut butter and haven't gone to the grocery store once. Every dollar that comes in goes right back into bills. This weekend I had no money or groceries so I ate a jar of peanut butter. I've been working class all of my life so if there's one thing I know how to do it is to watch my money and manage it to ensure I survive. This idea that I would still be collecting unemployment right now if I could because I'm ""lazy"" is infantile. These benefits are paid into with every paycheck. I've been paying into them for 25 years\s\s\sPeople with these kinds of punch down opinions are always someone who isn't living with So confident in judging and making choices for others from their black-and-white view of something they only imagine.You're not vaccinated are you? You don't wear a mask do you?Well we all know by now democrats are undercover communists. Unless you live under a rock 🪨 and don’t see what’s going on.You may be thinking of Authoritarianism not Communism.This attitude just gets you more Trump.Right because capitalism in its final stages becomes fascism. If you don't want more fascism two things have to happen 1. the perpetrators need to be held accountable (already not happening) and 2. People need material relief (which they are cancelling right now). When the working class has been bled dry over the years and there is no hope in the future except to slave away some more fascism will rise. \s\sYou also don't blame the person pointing it out you go to the source. Blaming the person pointing out the inequality for the inequality is what Republicans do and why so many people are stuck in this centrist nightmare. Starting holding power accountable and stop being mad at the people trying to make it better.Get a job. There are millions of them out there.Stop trying to convince us. Start working on your fellow congressmen.Tweets are good to get the message out - someone else might use different words that resonate better with some.  And maybe someone  who is still drinking the Koolaid will realize just how many people feel the same so maybe they should think.\s\sBut tweets also get old.  (Are you just trying to keep our enthusiasm up while still nothing happens?)\s\s:)Manufactured reasoning. It serves capital to divide the working class along as many lines as possible. Do everything but organize as one class against themIt's because immigrants don't have lobbyists and PR firms.We’ve been taught for the last several decades that if we work hard we will be wealthy and happy so much so that it’s become like scripture. And enshrining wealth leads to worshipping it and it’s “prophets” who could only really be the holders of it. So if that’s what we believe in then the opposite must also hold true. If the wealthy are holy then the poor must be bad. And it doesn’t hurt that they encourage that thinking knowing that if we keep hating the poor we’re less likely to dust off the guillotines. Compound that with the natural tribalism and xenophobia that’s baked into the species and it gives us another target—immigrants.You say that like anyone in charge ever intended that to happen.My question is if it at one time wasn’t happening what changed to make it happen? I really hope that makes sense…Friedman and the Chicago boys knew that it would do exactly what it did - shift wealth away from the middle class to the wealthy.I wonder I could get payed to conduct bullshit studies like this.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s""Water can make you wet a new study says""Well no shit skippy.U don’t say 🤔Welp tickling down doesn't work\s\sIn other equally shocking news sky blueNever thought about it that way but that’s so trueCan we just start calling capitalism parasitism and capitalists parasites?\s\sAnything that infects host systems then drains more resources from the hosts than it gives back causing injury and illness in the hosts is what?\s\sThese people pretend we are in a symbiosis where we provide labor and they give us jobs.

0,Enough_Sanders_Spam,WayOfTheBern,270,"Lame meme Benny. Troll harder.So you and Casey are sharing memes. Do you share accounts too?\s\ssmfhBernie said he would support the eventual democratic nominee if it wasn't him. He said this at the beginning. His imperative is to remove Trump and now Biden is our only chance.\s\sThis endorsement shouldn't be surprising to ANY Bernie supporter. Bernie stuck by his word. What else did you think was going to happen? \s\sAny Trump voter in this sub never supported Bernie. They are Trump supporters who want to stew progressive resentment and divide Democratic support.That's the thing. Most Bernie supporters aren't enamored with a cult of personality. We're not sycophants we're not yes men. We don't blindly follow what our chosen candidate says without thinking even when he contradicts himself. We voted to nominate a man for president not swear to obey every suggestion of his and take his word as gospel.I supported Bernie really liked his ideas but skeptical he would win and from the start I decided if it came down to it between Biden and trump that trump had my vote. Not because I’m huge fan or supporter but because the alternative is worse.  Honestly dems would have a chance if they would elect the shittiest candidates for there nomineesYou realize the Democratic convention had yet to happened nor have half the states voted. So why endorse Biden?But Biden isn’t “the only choice.” You may not agree with it but third party is always a choice. No vote is ever wasted if you made that vote using your morals and ideology guided by sound reasoning. The D and R parties thrive on the idea that “there is no other choice” there’s always another choice. In truth neither the DNC or GOP deserve anyone’s vote who has been marginalized by their shill bullshit. Trump sure AF doesn’t deserve my vote neither does Biden though; his voting record and demonstrated ideology prove him more a moderate leaning republican than democrat; which is why Obama picked him as VP because he knew that was the target demographic he needed to win. The lesser of two evils is still evil. I like a lot of people now don’t know what I’ll do come November.If you think Biden is the one to vote for simply as he ‘isnt Trump’ then its good to remember NAFTA. How Bush couldnt get it passed. What did the new neoliberal democrat do? Who blew up the prison population? \s\sThe problem with a fully corrupt two party system is that neither have your interests at heart. However a neoliberal can do truly horrific things as the party looks the other way. Look at how many are happy to completely ignore the rape allegations. The voting history. The family connections deep in corruption.   \sYet he is going to be the best choice as he simply isnt Trump. Thats just naive.This two party system really needs to go but sadly it seems most Americans have just accepted the status quo. Neo-libs are more than willing to ditch ideals just to have a chance at owning the Republicans and conservatives are totally down to murder the homeless population just to fill their pocket booksNAFTA and the prison bill both passed with full republican support.The thing is we never see the benefits of bills that politicians oppose. That’s why politics is such a shitshow. It’s about highlighting failures. Imagine if the TPP was a runaway success and created a new open border exchange system. But nah.I can think of few things more naive than believing a third party vote - or even choosing not to vote - in this election is constructive.>The family connections deep in corruption\s\sThis is how everyone knows you're actually a Trump supporter.>Look how many ignore the rape allegations... corruption...\s\sAre we talking about Trump again?Why do you think NAFTA was a bad thing?\s\s\sRelated question why do you hate the global poor?Obama was the first President since Carter to decrease the federal prison population. \s\s[Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/05/federal-prison-population-fell-during-obamas-term-reversing-recent-trend/)Look bottom line is it’s MY vote.

The DNC chose to put there support behind Biden well before the voting even started. And it’s there job to conform to their constituents to win a GENERAL election. Not produce a candidate. It’s that kind of thinking that lets dems lose when they could easily have the numbers every election cycle.Look at it this way: The DNC still has eight toes it can shoot off. If 2016 didn't teach them and 2020 won't teach them then let them die and resurrect something better out of the ashes. The country will have had enough of Trump by 2024. Maybe by then the DNC can actually field a winning candidate again after some serious introspection.[deleted]Ok folks the Shills and astroturfers are here [unnaturally all popping in at the same time to chastise and attack us.](https://imgur.com/a/hMenf5i)\s\s[OP is a known ESS troll.](https://imgur.com/a/ScwEzrz) so it's no surprise he called in the troops.[deleted]Troll or not it's still Bernie news. Doesn't really matter who posted itI will never understand this. Bernie had a real shot. Maybe not a great one but there’s no chance in hell Biden wins. Especially now with these assault stories? Sure Trump is horrible but is that the slogan for the left now? For two elections in a row we’re gonna go with “at least I’m not that guy”. Wtf. The DNC stole the primary from its own Democrats and they were prepared to steam roll Bernie again. This is only giving a Trump better odds.I'm really interested why you think sanders had a better chance than biden. I haven't seen a good argument for that. Polling and the voting results suggest the opposite.  \sAnd how did the dnc steel the primary?Here's what I don't understand.  Bernie was banking on the youth vote.  They just didn't come and vote.  How can we be sure they would have come to a general election?  Most stats that I saw saw the youth vote at near or under 20%.  It's the same story as always if you don't go vote your candidate doesn't win.\s\sI was rooting for Bernie I really was (I'm not from the US).  But the older demographic went and voted.  I'm assuming they will vote again in the general election.  I actually think that it's the best way to get rid of Trump.  (I still think Bernie would have been WAY WAY better but right now I'd just be happy if Trump is out of there)Biden is not ideal but I am looking forward to voting for him to try and help save our institutions and go back to a government that helps people in good faith. The idea that Biden has no shot to win is not based in reality. \s\sI am a Warren supporter and would have been happy to vote for Sanders but you can't go to a war with a party then expect to get their nomination. If he wanted to be a Democrat then he should have found a way to work with them and make everyone stronger. If the Democratic party was so bad then he should not have come crawling to them to try and be President. He went to war with the party and isolated a lot of people that he needed in order to win. Honestly? Come what may.The Republican party was backing Bernie as was Russia. They did not seem to share your idea that Bernie could win in the general. We won't get to see the negative campaign against Bernie so it's hard to imagine but trust Republicans to paint him any way they want. It's what they do. It's effective too. By the time the dust settles after the election and it's clear that Bernie was not all the things they said it'll be too late.\s\sAlso you know Warren and Sanders both scared greedy rich people. Money has a lot of power in politics.Trump will definitely mop the floor with Biden. The democratic base REQUIRES the liberal left to turn out. The electoral math is very simple here: If we don't vote Biden Biden doesn't get into office. This isn't the 1980s. Elections aren't about pandering to a long lost 25% swing voter block anymore. That block shrunk to like 4%. Today's elections are all about the base. And a significant portion of the base is damned unhappy with Rapey Joe. \s\sTrump doesn't have better odds. He literally has no impediment to a second term. I damn sure won't vote for Biden and I'm far from alone.Bunch of states have ""sore loser"" laws which prevent people who lost on the dem/repub primaries from running as a 3rd party.That would have been great with that idiot Joe Lieberman in Connecticut. Lost his primary and still ran like a true scumbag.ITT: People blaming us for their shitty neolib nominee.\s\sIf Biden is unlikable and doesn't get votes then it's the fault of the DNC who offered him to us.

We disagree on issues. **But my job now is to not only rally my supporters but to do everything I can to bring the party together** to see that (Trump) is not elected president.”If you vote for Trump you're a God damn fool. No true Bernie man would do that. Am I excited about Biden? Not particularly. However I'll be voting for him. If Trump disturbs you you should be voting for Biden too rather than calling him a pedophile.Both of them disturb me. One be voting for eitherHow about we vote for neither rapist neoliberal and focus our efforts instead on actually bringing about change at the local and state levels and organize to help exploited communities. Trump is a symptom of capitalism and anyone that thinks ousting him will improve this country is brainwashed by the two-party system.Hmmm Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky or grifter podcasters and angsty teenagers on reddit? Who to trust who to trust...The answer is always the podcasters/teens who will make money and get wire transfers from their parents no matter who wins!!And with this even more than with the endorsement even more than with the campaign dropout even more than with all the instances of ""Joe is my friend a decent guy and he can absolutely beat Trump"" Bernie can go fuck himself.\s\sSpent his entire life fighting for working people and he intends to end his career by backing a war criminal rapist on the payroll of corporate america?\s\sThat must have been some good shit that Obama made him smoke over the phone.\s\sThanks for energizing the movement now shut up and go away if you intend to undermine everything that you've done before. The people will take it from here just as you've been telling them to do for the past few years.1. He is not ending his career he is still very much a senator fighting the same fight he always has been. 2. Bernie has said since the beginning the most important part of this race is ""defeating the most dangerous president in modern history""Not voting for Biden in protest is not ""taking from here"". Anyone who chooses not to vote and allows a trump victory allows a further stacked SCOTUS and doesnt really care about progressive issues. When Trump wins and it's very likely he will and stacks the supreme court fights to end abortion rights eliminates more environmental protections etc. remember that's what you thought was best. You thought it was ok to sacrifice the future just so you could throw your little temper tantrum.I see a banner at the top of this page.\s\sIt says...\s\s""We're not a movement \swhere I can snap my fingers \sand say to you or to anybody else\swhat you should do.\s\s'Cause you won't listen to me \sand you shouldn't. \sYou'll make these decisions yourself.""A.  Tell the DNC they cant media manipulate the people's candidate out of the race then run their sad limping show pony\s\sOR\s\sB.  vote against 4 more years\s\sI want a way to do bothI wish we could have our cake and eat it too.  I held my breath and voted for Hillary in the last election cursing myself for doing so only knowing what was to come if Trump got elected.\s\sHe didn't start a land war which is nice.  That's about the best thing I can say about him.A) way too fucking late for that.\s\sB) that's Biden.  \s\sGodamnit I was raised to believe America was better than this.Some of us aren't as easily bought as being a ""Democrat"" or ""Republican"".  You ""Blue No Matter Who"" folks should think about your slogan.  If it really doesn't fucking matter to you vote with the people that have a bit of integrity and actually give a shit.  You're not going to tip the scales back in our favor by voting for a right leaning conservative democrat while we have the most Alt-right Hitler-eques president in history.  You lost my vote it's going to the fucktard Trump.  If 4 years of that fucking retard wasn't enough maybe you will be ready for a real change in another 4.Same. I'm voting green party so they can get some federal funds. Fuck the DemocratsSo you'd rather be spiteful and have a president who is objectively worse for workers women queer people and POC because we won't get radical change with Biden? Jfc be compassionate. We need to come together now not cry and whine bc our candidate lost.Dude you seriously just told people to toss their vote away so someone they hate can win the presidency over someone they do not hate.Real change will never happen in your lifetime if Trump gets another two SCOTUS seats even if a Bernie type wins in a landslide in 2024.That was the same logic you schmucks used last time. Really worked out this cycle didn't it?Ok then why not look at the Police positions from biden and trump. Most sanders voters would be much closer to biden I imagine.  \sAlso I don't think 4 years of trump will move the us more to the left. Has this idea ever worked? genuinely curiousYeah I remember dummies saying this in 2016. The Trump presidency wouldn't make it 4 years because there would be a revolution.\s\sCouldn't even get college students off their ass to vote for Bernie in the primaries now 4 years later.\s\sPetty rage voting that will fuck over everyone--that's a pretty Republican thing to do. You will find good company; there's lots of shitty humans voting for Trump.[deleted]Oh go fuck yourself you moobed mental midget.Bernie said this? Without a gun to his head?\s\s>“What would be the sense of staying in of spending a whole lot of money of attacking the vice president **giving fodder for Trump** -- what’s the sense of doing that when you can’t win?” he asked.\s\sI wasn't going to ask for refunds but after this shit i'm seriously considering it.Fuck off.Do you just refuse to recognize what’s at stake? I get you’ve probably already reconciled away every talking point from Bernie fans willing to vote for Biden but can you just not take a moment to think why?\s\sDiscounting all of the valid arguments of healthcare the court picks etc we actually have a higher than average chance at getting a supermajority again.\s\sWho do you think on the senate floor is going to have a larger than average leverage on policy discussion? No other senator is closer to what the American people want than Sanders.\s\sAnd even beyond that do you think Bernie wants his movement to die without him? Do you want to continue effecting change on the DNC (which is undeniable at this point)?Are you all too stupid to remember that he supported HRC after she got the nom? He literally thinks anyone is better then Trump. He's taking his loss way better then you babies kicking and screaming that you hate Biden. I hate him but I hate Trump more and I'm willing to vote for a douche over a turd sandwich.>  I'm willing to vote for a douche over a turd sandwich\s\s\sYeah literally nothing will change ever if your entire political praxis is just voting for the lesser evilVote blue no matter who.\s\sIt **can't be Trump.** I know the non-bots in here understand this.[deleted]Too bad it prolly will be. Bernie was our only chanceBernie Sanders said Tuesday that it would be “irresponsible” for his loyalists not to support Joe Biden warning that progressives who “sit on their hands” in the months ahead would simply enable President Donald Trump’s reelection.\s\sAnd lest there be any question the 78-year-old Vermont senator confirmed that “it’s probably a very fair assumption” that he would not run for president again. He added with a laugh: “One can’t predict the future.”\s\sSanders who suspended his presidential bid last week spoke at length about his decision to endorse Biden his political future and the urgent need to unify the Democratic Party during an interview with The Associated Press. He railed against the Republican president but also offered pointed criticism at his own supporters who have so far resisted his vow to do whatever it takes to help Biden win the presidency.They still want us to think it's DEM vs GOP. \s\sIt's not.\s\sIt's corp crooks vs the people.\s\s\#NeverBidenYou realize the people aren’t running for president anymore right? It’s Biden or Trump.Come a stacked Supreme Court you'll wish you hadn't been so short sighted.Biden sucks and he's basically a moderate republican BUT for at risk minority groups he is still meaningfully better than Trump who actively uses racial agitation to push his agenda.\s\sI don't believe in telling anyone how to vote and all votes must be earned but to believe that there is no difference between Biden and Trump is something that can only be said from a position of privilege.A vote for anyone other than Biden is a lifetime 6-3 conservative SCOTUS that will set any Bernie idea back in time rather than take small steps towards the future. Get your Russian troll ass out of here.Mentalities like this is going to get us fucked for four more years. Sucks but you need to vote for who will damage this country less instead of being a pretentious assholeFuck you Bernie.\s\sThe only irresponsible person here is you.  If you wanted to stop Trump you chose the most counter-productive way to go about ita way that all but guarantees a Trump victory while discrediting you and your entire movement.\s\sAnd now here you are joining the establishment and their paid trolls to browbeat and insult your supporters--people who fought for you and struggled and sacrificed to give you as much of their meager free time and money and energy as they could and how dare you spit in their face like this you can attack them without a qualm but you couldn't attack your good friend Biden in the debates--into line behind your precious blue rapist I have no interest in hearing anything further from you.  You are clearly totally compromised at this point whether by money naivete or straight up threats to your family's lives and you will be very lucky if i don't vote Trump just to ensure you and your new masters fail spectacularly.  It's Green or Trump take your pick but it will never be Biden.\s\sSo I'd advise you to shut the fuck up now.This is just dumb. You would rather have Trump to spite everyone. I'm not sure what your background is but most people saying that are people that are less influenced by Trump's policies and rhetoric.dittoHe said from the start he'll endorse the nominee.He didn’t get the nomination. He wouldn’t win solely off of write in ballots. He is doing the only thing left to defeat trump. You are an emotional fool.Mmmmm fresh pasta!\s\sAlso I feel like threats of death to your family members is a solid reason to withdraw. Just putting that out there.\s \sCalm down get a little older and remember: use your heart to vote in the primaries and your head to vote in the general.Same!!!You’re supporting a pedophile serial rapist then to stick it to Bernie.

""Hell no I won't Joe.""](https://youtu.be/KV45H08VmHc?t=189)Nicw try.If trump wins you’ll be waiting much much longer for the policies you so desperately want. Stop being petty bitter and childish and trust Bernie’s judgement.No you won't. If they turn up for Biden despite the lack of any concessions from him then the DNC will know once and for all they can ignore any progressive positions. They need to learn that they have to EARN their votes you can't guilt trip people into voting for you.\sEdit: TypoDamn gotta say it... Fuck you Sanders.Is it just me or does it sound like Bernie is trying to vote-shame us into voting for Biden?  It's basically the same things the Biden supporters are telling us.\s\sNever thought I'd see the day.Are you fucking retarded?  That guy knows that he ain't ganna win and he's being realistic. Its either trump or biden who will win. You choose who the lesser evil is.Wow the people in this post are insane. Did you all forget the 2016 election? Did you forget how after Bernie lost he endorsed and campaigned for hill dawg? How quickly dumb people on reddit forgot these facts. If you really thought Bernie wouldn't endorse the nominee you were smoking crack.Have you considered the moral argument for doing it.Bernie knows that if the far-left makes a big stink about not voting for Biden and then Biden still ends up winning the Democratic party will never ever bend to try to entice them into the party.\s\sWhy would they? Between Bernie showing that they aren't enough to get a nomination and then them showing they don't need them to win elections it shows they have no teeth.\s\s\sAnd if Biden loses even after he's shifted his campaign to becoming the most progressive candidate campaign in US history? It shows that trying to court progressives is a losing battle and the next campaign will shift further right trying to get Republican fringe voters. \s\sThere is no winning for progressive believers in not voting. You either show that you aren't needed or you show that you aren't enough to win an election.\s\s\s\sBut you can do what Bernie is doing. He's trying to work within the party to shift it left. And it's working. Biden's campaign platform is the most progressive platform of any major US party candidate in US history.Sure as hell sounds that way to me . Nice knife  Bernie .He most definitely is. Not me us went down the drain I guessHow trump would have wanted itOkay something is seriously wrong here. Wtf did they threaten Bernie with.4 more years of trump is what they threatened him with.Four more years of Trump.They threatened him with 4 more years of Trump you retard.He said from day one that he'd support the nominee. \s\sAlso it's Bernie Sanders. I really doubt he'd let anyone boss him around with threats he's been firm in his politics for decades.A Trump presidency isn't enough?SmhYOU GUYS. It’s simple. Our country (and my mental health) cannot handle another 4 years of Trump. If you feel the same then vote for Biden.Perfect. I’ll give up all of my morals for some random person on the internet!Until we have election reform (ranked voting) to allow more than two parties ANY vote not for the Democratic nominee is a vote for Trump. It's terrible but true and he understands that. I wrote in Bernie 2016 while in a staunchly conservative state so I could stick it to the DNC. If I keep that up then my vote truly will never matter because I'm not helping build the numbers to give anyone not a conservative a chance here.* If I vote Green Trump 0 Biden 0\s* If I vote Blue Trump 0 Biden 1\s* If I vote Trump (and I will) Trump 1 Biden 0\s\sProof: that you are full of shit.Biden is a pedophile! Don't vote for him![deleted]Trump is just as bad a pedophile as Biden if not worse as there are verified accounts of him walking in on naked underage girls changing rooms etc. \s\sIf you don't vote for Biden you are causing Trump to be reelected.This is the new talking point from the bots.\s\sHave you considered not being manipulated?Too damned bad...I maxed out contributions two election cycles so he could try and shame me and everyone else\s\sshame on you bernie for selling out....and for being weak\s\sit is clear now that it was never about actually winning for you\s\sand if trump was such an existential threat to humanity why did you run in the god damned corrupt democratic primary in 2020 to begin with?\s\swhat...you didn’t think they’d cheat again this time?\s\sand where is your apology for selling every last one of us down the river? Sorry...can’t hear you...\s\skeep pushing Bernie and I will vote for trump this time\s\snever BidenGross. Why would you support Trump?If you vote for Trump over Biden you were never a true Bernie supporter I'm sorry.As someone who supported Bernie so hard you should know that he has pledged to support the eventual Dem nominee since the beginning. This wasn’t a question this was baked in. Winning means getting Trump out of the White House he’s doing his part. He ran as a Democrat because we don’t have third party presidents in this country. Did you want him to lead or just make a statement?[deleted]>If anyone suggests voting 3rd party or writing in Bernie I just assume they're pro Trump.\s\sBut I think you know that's not true and are only choosing to frame it that way to validate your malignment. Which isn't even necessary your free to dislike other liberals without having to frame us as non-liberals to make it pallatable. \s\sBut I will say this mentality is exactly why I no longer support the democratic party. If that makes me your enemy now then so be it I guess. I'm definitely not pro-Trump though.Trump's winning anyway why not make a point and show the DNC that you won't put up with their bullshitAnd this is why Biden will lose.  You're not going to shame people with actual morals into voting to break them.   \s\sIt's too much to ask.Just for fun I'll write you in.  Because it is my goddamn right as an American to vote FOR whatever the fuck I want.  The DNC doesn't own my vote and if the DNC doesn't represent me the DNC does not get my vote.  It's not Trump vs. The Everyone Else Party.No they aren't. It's a strategy of the Bern it dovvners. The plan if a progressive vas not on the ballot is to instead get the nastiest person in office possible in order to inspire a violent revolution. They vvill do this by making the election look as rigged as possible and then just letting Trump do his normal thing.Never thought I’d say it but Bernie can Fuck off. I’m done with him.lolWhat about the policies and ideas that he stood for can those go fuck off too? Or was it really just all about Bernie with you. I think you are a shallow voter with no real long term planning and you are making a stupid decision based on resentment. Interesting you don't resent Trump enough to vote against him  but you are taking the burn it all down route just because Joe Biden was democratically decided to be the nominee.bwahahahahah\s\sWhen personality cults go wrongI'm a bot *bleep* *bloop*.

I've got another potential chance of being berated as I just was on that sub for exactly this reason. I truly couldn't grasp how the people on that sub assumed that a) I believed Bernie supporters are cultists despite me never saying that or implying it and b) that I'm a corporate establishment individual which how could you establish that based on no supporting evidence?  I will say that that sub was filled with some of the most childish people I've ever come across.  Just itching to get into an argument rather than possibly have a constructive conversation let alone possibly consider that other people may not have the same viewpoint as them.  Shocking!Who stands to gain by splitting the Dem vote? Trump.\s\sGuaranteed a large portion of the ‘people’ in the sub are just Russian bots.Sanders supporters listen to him until he asks them to do something for him. ""Leave your dorm for 2 hours and show the world what our revolution looks like!""\s\s""No thanks! But we feel the burn!""\s\s""Ok I lost. It's time to rally together to defeat Trump because it's not about me it's about us!""\s\s""We love you Bernie but no thanks!""\s\sWhat did he accomplish is the end? Got the DNC to drag themselves more left? Who fucking cares? Doesn't matter what Democrats concede they aren't going to win in November. Why has anyone been trying to appeal to angry kids who don't vote anyway?\s\sWhat a fucking waste of time.ah yes bernie supporters who did the most phonebanking textbanking and who gave the most individual donations by FAR are lazy and dont care about their candidate. also you're right it doesn't matter what the democrats concede because time and time again they have proven untrustworthy and sleazy. bernie *was* the compromise. you call us a personality cult and then as soon as we disagree with bernie we're lazy pieces of shit. you'll never be satisfied all you view politics as is a team sport.Write letters to the address in the side bar demanding refunds of your donations.\s\sFuck Bernie Sanders all to hell.You can't possibly be this delusionalHoly shit you guys are actually asking for refunds.\s\sI thought that was just a meme we made up on E_S_S. It’s like when the Onion writes a story that later becomes true.I live in California so there is no way I'm voting for JoePeople who are ""Bernie or bust"" are prioritizing their personal purity over the countless people who will be hurt by another Trump presidency. To me that seems very selfish narcissistic disconnected privileged and apathetic to the suffering that Trump will cause.\s\sI'm saying this as someone who had Bernie as their #1 pick. Biden was like my 6th pick but I'm sucking it up putting my ""moral integrity"" aside and will vote in such a way to help as many people as I can at this point. I am capable of understanding that the guy I like the most didn't get as many votes and that is no excuse to flip the table over.You'll vote for your rapist of choice and pretend you ever had ""moral integrity"" in the first place.  How embarrassing.Bernie was my top pick also (as he was in 2016).  Biden was pretty far down the list.  Trump isn't on the list.\s\sI think Biden's pick for VP will also have a lot of influence.  Hopefully he will pick one of the more progressive people that he faced in the primaries.  That would make supporting the total ticket easier.  Plus it is good insurance if Biden has to leave the office for some reason. (I really shudder when I think of Pence as a potential POTUS)If Biden loses the progressive movement in America is pretty much castrated. M4A abortion rights trans rights all that shit is off the table if Trump manages to solidify a 7-2 Supreme Court that will last **DECADES**. RBG and Breyer are in their 80s and Thomas might retire.\s\sBasically if you actually care about any of the ideas and policies Bernie's been preaching then you're shooting yourself in the foot by not voting for Biden.  Bernie understands this and that's why we'll be hearing him stump for Biden super hard over the next 7 months.Abolish the fucking Supreme Court or pack it with liberals then. There's no law that says 9 is the upper limit. This is the most inane argument to vote Biden even if it were true getting a Dem Congress majority is a much more effective strategy.Holy shit I don't have enough alcohol for this.Agree 💯srdines reading this: you're trashIt’s irresponsible not to vote for a rapist?¿I love you Bernie but you're not in the driver's seat anymore.

It's not my responsibility to help their hopeless cause.  At least when supporting Bernie there was a good chance he could defeat Trump so it wasn't hopeless.Bernie had 397K primary votes in Florida.  I'll bet it would have been nice to have those in the Dem's column right about now.I mean Trump is beating J'Biden by 377K votes in Florida.  Just sayin'.More reliably idiotic bullshit from you Coop.\s\sYou never disappoint.Steph! How are you feeling today? Should be happy that Trump will get removed right. I told you! Great day for America and the world. 😘\s\sIn all seriousness tho one of the biggest hits Dems took this election were the riots and Trump trying to paint Biden as a destructive socialist. I would have been absolutely fine with Bernie but he would have lost. The ""socialism"" boogeyman is too powerful for the Midwest and Florida (and Nevada and Arizona).Neoliberal establishment talking points from Cooper.From /u/chakokat in the comments:\s\s---\s\sFrom Wikipedia:\s>**The CPC was established in 1991** by U.S. Representatives Ron Dellums (D-CA) Lane Evans (D-IL) Thomas Andrews (D-ME) Peter DeFazio (D-OR) Maxine Waters (D-CA) **and Bernie Sanders (I-VT)**\s\s\sAnd HOW did John Lewis win his first Congressional seat?? \s\sAlso from Wikipedia:\s\s>After nine years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives Fowler gave up the seat to make a successful run for the U.S. Senate. Lewis decided to run for the 5th district again. In the August Democratic primary where a victory was considered tantamount to election State Representative Julian Bond ranked first with 47% just three points shy of winning outright. Lewis finished in second place with 35%.[49] In the run-off Lewis pulled an upset against Bond defeating him 52% to 48%.[50] **The race was said to have ""badly strained relations in Atlanta's black community"" as many Black leaders had supported Bond over Lewis.[51] Lewis was ""endorsed by the Atlanta newspapers and a favorite of the white liberal establishment”**.[52] His victory was due to strong results among white voters (a minority in the district).[52] **During the campaign he ran advertisements accusing Bond of corruption implying that Bond used cocaine and suggesting that Bond had lied about his civil rights activism.[52]**\s\s\sGee look at that John Lewis not only used the civil rights card against Bernie he also did it against his black opponent Julian Bond!! \s\sSeems like John Lewis wasn’t quite the “stand up guy” that he seems. And notice that HE was supported in his race by WHITE liberals while Bond was supported by the BLACK community!Hey u/FThumb\s\sThis might sound crazy but I'd go one step further than pinning and add it to the sidebar under something like ""How privileged neoliberals deflect criticism"".\s\sI also feel like this was a moment solidarity for everyone hereThat's really staggering. So what did the white Lib establishment know that the rest of the good voters in the district didn't? must have been ""something"" if they knew just how to vote right?\s\sThis I think is a great testament to just how deeply corrupt the election process is in this country. Something smells awfully fishy about this one old election.\s\smay be that's when Lewis became totally compromised and basically made a pact with the devil. The rest was just a chair warming and favor distributing exercise. Also yes color coding for those who needed cover.\s\sWhen will the downtrodden people of the country  - black and white and all colors in between - wake up and smell the flowers?I'm not making anyone's death about anything. But since you posted about about the CPC originally the House Progressive Caucus I think facts matter. \s\sThe idea for a progressive caucus was that of Bernie Sanders even though he never took credit for for it. He proposed it as soon as he got to the House.  The others your post named were founding members.   \s\sSanders chaired the Caucus for its first eight years. When he moved to the Senate he became the only Senator in the Caucus; and someone else began chairing it.  In time the name changed to the Congressional Progressive Caucus but when I last checked (a while ago I confess) Sanders was still the only Senator in the Caucus.\s\sAnd the issue is not whom Lewis endorsed.  In 2016 the only members of either house of Congress who endorsed Sanders were the co-chairs of the CPC and Merkley.  The issue was that Lewis lied about Sanders not having been active in the civil rights movement back in the day of MLK Jr. and Hillary being active.  According to Lewis he saw Hillary in the movement.  However the opposite was so. By her own admission Hillary had canvassed for Nixon when he ran against JFK and was a ""Goldwater Girl"" then President of College Republicans at Wellesley while Bernie was getting chained to other civil rights activists by the police.Lewis was a great man in his youth.  In his old age he shilled for Hillary and therefore contributed to President Trump.  It’s possible to be good sometimes and bad sometimes.  It’s possible to change for the worse over the course of a lifetime.  Every man has to follow his own path.  This tweet is an effort to demonize Bernie supporters. That’s ok.   It’s not the first time.  Bernie himself was nothing but gracious about Lewis because Bernie doesn’t just think about himself.>Bernie himself was nothing but gracious about Lewis because Bernie doesn’t just think about himself.\s\sBernie was thinking about himself. He likes being the good guy. Instead of being Mr. Nice Guy he should have thought about the revolution and the movement and his supporters a little more. \s\sHis graciousness was damaging.Anyone who labels Bernie a ""backbencher Senator"" is welcome to drown in the gutter in their own vomit ASAP.\s\sIt was BERNIE who was the true follower of MLK not that sell-out Lewis.  MLK said that what we needed was a ""democratic socialism"".""Back bencher.""  ""Our guy is better than your guy.""  ""Bernie lost.""\s\sInteresting sentiments.  Unfortunately we don't really play team sports around here.  \s\sLewis is a disappointment.  Bernie is a disappointment.  That's why we call them both out.  \s\sGrow up.Amendments don't count. Only front page titles count.Is it appropriate to call out Lewis in the way this sub has been doing in the wake of his death? Because I think it’s a disgrace.What's really funny about all of this is the assumption that people criticizing John Lewis or any number of other sellout politicians- I say sellout because Lewis *did* have a genuinely heroic youth- did so solely because of Bernie Sanders. \s\sThese fucking people were shit long before they went after one political candidate and they're shit afterward too. John was subsumed into the neoliberal capitalist order that has destroyed our society enabled imperialism across the world created the preconditions for the barbaric lack of social welfare in our country and is to this day refusing to meaningfully address an environmental crisis that could spell the end of life as we know it. He was part of that. He lent his legitimacy to it. He was a lifelong enabler of this fucking death cult ideology. He deserves nothing less than scorn for that like everyone else who does what he did- his silly smearing of Bernie Sanders was just icing on the cake. \s\sAnd ofc as others have pointed out this dumbass is clearly thoroughly privileged with her line of bullshit about ""joylessness"" and all the rest. Most people have fuck all to be ""joyful"" about politically or existentially as we face the greatest systemic crises in our species's history with literally no segments of established power willing to address any of them meaningfully. \s\sThe few that do run around looking for ""joy"" in politics are incredibly privileged. I really could care less what they think as they are a wildly overrepresented and rapidly shrinking minority.These people don't give a fuck about corruption. They don't give a flying rats ass about the potential of this country. They don't care how much they are being fucked over as long as it's with a sweet talking person that adheres to American Exceptionalism. \s\sThey have theirs fuck you and the people you're fighting for.[deleted]My dad used to work with and knew John Lewis personally. This subreddit is full of a bunch of people high on their pedestals talking down to a man who wanted change and actually took it into his own hands. Good people who take it upon themselves to change the world around them are few and rare to come by. \s\sThis subreddit is full of people who want change and a perfect world but don’t have the slightest inclination to do anything themselves about it. All they do is complain that others aren’t good enough.Is one idiots personal opinion supposed to mean something?\s\sand isn’t Bernie trying to help your addle brained demented candidate these days?  So why diss him?\s\slook forward to the day that you actually post something intelligent...LOL\s\sneverbidenBernie Sanders has the fucking best record of any Senator in Congress on every damn bill.Of course he wouldn't join the ""moderates"" and have bipartisan consensus for anything he passes.\s\sLoads of joy when the US is literally going through a huge economic crisis.Bernie was the FDR that would save unfettered capitalism from itself and shake up the power structures in Washington.\s\sEnjoy Tom Cotton/Tucker Carlson in 2024FDR was the shittiest president in our entire history. Many of our issues today can be traced back to him and his terrible policies he put into place.Re posting my comment from down thread:\s\sThe tweet was about “Bernie Bros” being mad that John Lewis didn’t endorse Bernie who BTW was a founding member of Congressional Progressive Caucus. Where was John Lewis even though he was in Congress since 1986?? Not in the Congressional Progressive Caucus that’s for sure!\s\s>From Wikipedia:\s>The CPC was established in 1991 by U.S. Representatives Ron Dellums (D-CA) Lane Evans (D-IL) Thomas Andrews (D-ME) Peter DeFazio (D-OR) Maxine Waters (D-CA) and **Bernie Sanders (I-VT)**\s\s\sAnd HOW did John Lewis win his first Congressional seat??\s\s>Also from Wikipedia:\s\s>After nine years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives Fowler gave up the seat to make a successful run for the U.S. Senate. **Lewis decided to run for the 5th district again. In the August Democratic primary where a victory was considered tantamount to election State Representative Julian Bond ranked first with 47% just three points shy of winning outright. Lewis finished in second place with 35%.**[49] In the run-off Lewis pulled an upset against Bond defeating him 52% to 48%.[50] **The race was said to have ""badly strained relations in Atlanta's black community"" as many Black leaders had supported Bond over Lewis.[51] Lewis was ""endorsed by the Atlanta newspapers and a favorite of the white liberal establishment”.**[52] His victory was due to strong results among white voters (a minority in the district).[52] **During the campaign he ran advertisements accusing Bond of corruption implying that Bond used cocaine and suggesting that Bond had lied about his civil rights activism.[52]**\s\s\sGee look at that John Lewis not only used the civil rights card against Bernie he also did it against his black opponent Julian Bond!!\s\sSeems like John Lewis wasn’t quite the “stand up guy” that he seems. \s\sAnd notice that HE was supported in his race by WHITE liberals while Bond was supported by the BLACK community!\s\sSO FUCK OF YOU REVISIONIST TROLL!TIL...dude holy cowSellout and traitor to his people and his own legacy. It's merely a fact. Lewis' problem not ours.Whis the real sellout? I like turtles. \shttps://i.redd.it/1gl6juurnqb51.jpgHere's another comment from a real genius biden bro:\s\s@_Alex_Perdue\s\s>Purging the Bernie bros and folks like Sirota and Brie Brie is exactly what the DNC should do post-election. The vast majority of Bernie folks aren’t these extremists but the extremists should be given no quarter when they just want to shit on their fellow Dems.\s\spost-election roflmao *please vote* first...and then you will be purged.\s\sDavid Sirota posted an appropriate Eddie Murphy clip:\s\shttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1284909031614631936>they just want to shit on their fellow Dems.\s\s\sThey still don't fucking get it. Democrats aren't our fellows.>post-election\s\sThat says everything about their so called ""Unity""Man these turtle fuckers like OP must be huge Trump supporters. They do everything in their power to drive people away from the Democratic Party. \s\sAlso if you can't handle criticism because you're too wrapped up in hero worship you're not actually democratic. You're authoritarian just like Trump.John Lewis was a flawed human being as are we all. Don't look for saints on Capitol Hill. \s\sJohn Lewis the civil rights hero is only part of who John Lewis became as a politician. The pious hypocrisy of speaking no ill of the dead lays the foundation for revisionist history and restoring the reputation of the likes of Nixon and Bush II.\s\s[How sad is this that OP would bother to post this here? Little id.]So what exactly is the ideal situation for this person that still permits a discussion of the political harm/consequences of Lewis's actions?\s\sOr would that just be completely off-limits and we're supposed to pretend and act as if he did nothing wrong.\s\sNot to mention if similarly hostile message was posted in ESS it would be deleted immediately and user banned on sight. Here it gets pinned and the user aint banned.You're not supposed to use critical thinking. Remember orange man bad Bernie bad HW Bush was a war hero GW Bush just made some mistakes and Hillary didn't lose because of anything that had to do with her. Call it r/WayofTheShills.. LOL!Fuck off back to enoughBernieSpam OP.It’s NOT that John Lewis didn’t *endorse* Bernie bitch it’s that he LIED about Bernie’s civil rights participation  and then on top of that he LIED that Hillary *was* involved when clearly she was too young to have been involved. \s\sIT’S about THE LIE bitch!Because going to a rally once and then fucking off to Vermont for the rest of his life with 0 legislation to his name makes you a civil rights icon. Lol.Who is this?  \s\sCalling Bernie a ""back bench"" senator pretty much voids her little nobody ass opinion.   \s\sBye Felicia.> Who is this?\s\sSomeone upset that Bernie didn't carve out policies that would help the AA community in isolation that didn't also help poor people in general.Ahh yes instead we should listen to the people dancing on the grave of a civil rights hero 🙄wonder who Monjula thinks isn't a ""back bencher"".\s\sInteresting article that discusses Clyburn's and Lewis' attacks on Bernie:\s\s>In the lead up to the South Carolina primary for example where black voters are the Democratic majority **Rep. James Clyburn told voters that Bernie’s free public college legislation would undermine historically black colleges and universities — even though black students would disproportionately benefit from it** and despite the fact that Sanders did have targeted funding in his bill to support those historically black institutions. Rep. John Lewis for his part insulted Bernie’s civil rights activism and used austerity politics to delegitimize key elements of his agenda including universal health care:\s\s>>There’s not anything free in America. We all have to pay for something. Education is not free. Health care is not free. Food is not free. Water is not free. I think it’s very misleading to say to the American people we’re going to give you something free.\s\s>The contradictions manifest in Lewis’s remark are instructive. Corporate Democrats know that the **failures of Obamacare** — thirty million uninsured and tens of millions more underinsured due to exorbitant cost-sharing — **have hit Latinx and black Americans the hardest.** They also know that the closest thing to single payer in the United States **Medicare has been effective in mitigating racial disparities** among people aged sixty-five and over. Yet many of them still reject the idea that racial gender and class-based injustice could be alleviated through universal forms of public investment and an equitable redistribution of wealth.\s\s>**That rejection was particularly ironic in Lewis’s case since he perhaps more than anyone else alive today is aware that civil rights was about merging movements for black freedom with the general struggle of “the common man.”**\s\shttps://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/medicare-for-all-2020-election-sanders\s\sClyburn and Lewis aren't heros.Who cares.  What happened happened.  Ain’t nobody gonna be shamed by this tone policing.What happened was that John Lewis LIED and he shamed himself with that lie!No maybe you neoliberals ought to reflect on how you keep dodging reality behind idpol while the bottom 80% suffer because of this nonsense. John Lewis stopped giving a shit about civil liberties when he got on that neoliberal train and so does anybody else who pretends to care about race but sides with big business at the expense of suffering for the working class. There's no liberty or freedom when the healthcare debt trap is a noose around your neck. \s\sYou can pretend from inside your neoliberal high income good insurance bubble that everything is hunky dory and get fee fees about idpol but many people do not have the same luxury in America. Many people can't afford to take college-level social science classes where you learn all of these concepts about race and privilege. This bullshit idpol is a privilege and you ought to check yours before you try to check the privilege of someone who makes less than $60k a year. \s\sBefore I get accused of white supremacy let me note that I'm a POC and first generation immigrant with a thick accent and have experienced more than my fair share of racism and discrimination. Nobody gets a free pass on betraying the working class most especially not these corrupt POC and POC-adjacent politicians who take advantage of their skin color and idpol to make people vote against their own interests. \s\sYou fail to recognize that a significant part of the hatred and discrimination that POC receive lies rooted in the rising economic disparity that the neoliberal class keeps promoting.Well said!""your joyless movement""\s\sI love this little twist. We are joyless not our fucked up situation where elections are being stolen the planet is being killed the billionaires are murdering humanity.\s\sIf only we were cheery and joyful!!! Then people would join our movement! And things would be hunky-dory!!!Especially considering that the entire neoliberal push for establishment candidates is all about expressing a sense of victimization and outrage over Trump and the 2016 election. There is absolutely no joy there. That's exemplified by the fact that even the majority of Blue MAGA aren't happy to be voting for Biden.We should be *grateful* that the establishment is kneeing us in the balls and then kicking us while we're down. Don't you know that our ""betters"" know what's good for us?So much joy to go around these days of course....He lied about a Jew whom he wanted to prevent winning the Democratic Party nomination..\s\sSuch a distinguished Civil Rights career tarnished at the very end by his own anti-Semitism....I don’t know if he lied about Bernie because he was anti-semitic but more than likely because he was a Clintonista. He probably would have lied about anyone in Hillary’s way. As soon as she lost he jumped on the “Russia Russia” bandwagon to discredit Trump. He was a toady for the neoliberal class.She knows that Bernie isn't a ""white dude"" right?? I knew antisemitism was still around but after all the stuff with those nfl and nba players lately its really scary just how prevalent it still is.Surprise: President obama didnt end racism joe is a racist and all the talk about a group that is not even negligible in its hate (the far alt right) we have managed to enable more extremist racism on the left to the 'acceptible' parties.\s\sA large contingent of Warren supporters hold these same racial extremist viewpoints.A message for anyone posting here from ESS.\s\sEat shit asshole.

That corrupt dipshit Lewis did all he could to interfere and obstruct the investigation into the RussiaGate hoax pushing fabricated lies whenever he could. I also remember how he obstructed the investigation of Hillary's many crimes mishandling top secret information and all the emails detailing her pay-for-play scheme Uranium One deal and her taking bribes from Russian oligarchs destroying evidence and so on.\s\sThe world is a better place without this dirtbag.Yeah we know your thoughts.

Look at the wikileaks emails about Ro Khanna. \s\sBernie is not wrong. The party's strategy is the affluent population centers which mostly occupy costal states New York San Fransisco Detroit  Chicaco Miami Seattle San Diego LA. \s\sLook at their major donor list and where they come from. \s\sThis is why they lost the Senate and all these state houses and why they lose seats in the House. Sure you got your dozen or so coastal states and population hubs but you basically ignore the rest of the country outside that. \s\sThe Republican Party takes advantage of that and uses these state houses to carbon copy laws out of ALEC and the Heritage Foundation. Now you have over half the states dancing legal circles around the Democrats. \s\sThe strategy and aim of the party ignores middle America.  Then they wonder why they can't flip the Senate and why they get such bloodbaths at the house and why so many states are fucking around with the courts passing up the chain to the supreme court all these cases that hurt democrat interests. \s\sSo if you want to neuter the supreme court - you need to get involved with the states of middle America and the flyover states so you can get back those state houses local courts and cut that ALEC to Supreme court case pipeline in the bud. \s\sI had like a dozen different judges and court positions on my ballot.

There's not much of that to be had. And by blaming the media for his defeat Sanders takes credit away from the remarkable comeback that Joe Biden the presumptive nominee who he formally endorsed just this week engineered.\s\sThe Point: The media is an easy scapegoat. But not always the right one.I think the article states it pretty well: the media definitely had a role in Bernie not winning but he also made a lot of other (unforced) errors.  \s  \sThe most important issue for voters this election is beating Trump. Lots of people that voted for Biden had serious concern about Bernie's chances (right or wrong those concerns did exist). Bernie didn't do a good job reaching out and convincing those voters otherwise. Even worse he actively attacked the DNC which is really not a good idea is many voters you need identify themselves as Democrats.\s  \sAnd added to that Bidens platform is very popular under Dem voters even more than Sanders' platform.The Democratic primary voters despised Clinton but still like Obama. The Trump PTSD factor was huge in making the entire election an electability contest. This is squarely on the media for abdicating any responsibility of reporting what's going on with candidates if electability really was the key.\s\sBiden may as well be a cardboard cutout of Obama. He's an empty shell of himself even coasting on his image from a few years ago. Again on the media for hiding him for a full year. The states where people actually got to see him up close and interact with hm they went: woawhatthefuckisthatthing? So I have absolutely no idea what specific set of policy from him people like or dislike insofar as he's able to finish a thought.\s\sIt also is clear that issues didn't stand a chance they simply didn't matter. Even if they did when polled most thought Biden is for M4A. Abdication on the part of the media again for confusing the voters that all Dems are the same. Most voters are way too dumb or don't care which is to be expected. They just needed someone to tell them authoritatively who to vote for.\s\sI think there were strategic errors in the Sanders campaign like not seeing that the anti Trump factor which resulted in a crazy high suburban (even decency seeking Republican in fact) single issue voter turnout. That said I don't think a different strategy would've mattered. The Democratic party is made of docile MSNBC viewers. You don't have their support then you're screwed. As simple as that. Just a bad cycle to run in. Also terrible party. Hope many young people see that this party is not theirs and decide to take their efforts outside of electoral politics.\s\sI am not sure I've seen any conflict between him and the DNC this cycle so I have no idea what you're talking about.*Woman not affiliated with wotb claims she was sexually harassed by Biden when she was fourteen*\s\s*random troll decides to go on wotb and tell its readers to make it stop*As soon as the Tara story fell apart you guys were pushing this one. Both backfired. You're getting a real reputation. I like turtles.Woman misremembers at which event incident occurred when she was 14. Bidenverse orgasms.And the exact same evidence would be fully damning if it were Trump Kavanaugh or any other Republican and they'd be sensibly pointing out that a memory from someone when they were 14 yrs old that mixes up the venue in question isn't a solid refutation of the claim.\s\sBut that's only because the Republicans are the very Gods of Evil and Rape and the Democrats are the Gods of Purity and Goodness and therefore any accusation against the former is a priori true and any accusation against the latter is a priori false.Bernie bros get fooled by more lies. So fucking gullible. I like turtles.Political scandals are as much about the response as the accusations. We are know that just about every politician has seedy stuff in their past. We also know that they are likely to face some false accusations. There are good ways and bad ways to respond to the accusations from Reade and other women and Biden’s reaction has been entirely bad. It’s just confirming to progressives that there is zero difference between Biden and Trump and between centrist Democrats and Republicans. But turtles are cool. I agree with you on that.When will you stop shilling for your sexual assaulter Biden Benny?She has a picture at the event with pedo Biden it doesn't matter if she doesn't remember every detail of the event when there is proof she was there.Show me the picture.

Yeah I’ll take literally fucking anyone who isn’t that stupid.  \s\s2) “He’s lying about 15 dollar minimum wage” \sUnless you are a telepath that’s can discern that Biden has just been lying this whole time then I’d say it would probably pass. Ironically enough I don’t actually think 15 dollar min wage is a good idea but because Bernerino supported it you are obligated to support bad policy and just say “he’s lying lmao” \s\s3) “Lol deportations” \sI’m assuming you are talking about the highly misleading figure that said that Obama was responsible for more deportations than Bush. The reason this is the case is because the definition of a deportation was changed. And while we are at it “Lol Mexico is sending us rapists and killers”. I think I’ll take my chances on Biden being more pro immigrant \s\s4) pro-DACA \sYep. Clear reason to vote Biden. \s\s5) pro choice \sAs above \s\s6) Pro-Gun Control: “Bad Policy” \sWtf do you mean? It’s very good policy to remove guns from communities. The US uniquely has a gun problem in the modern world so gun control seems to be the most rational policy to fix that \s\s7) Liberal Judges \sAgain wtf?? I have no idea what you are talking about. The Supreme Court’s liberal wing recently made a couple of massive rulings for both abortion and civil rights. Furthermore to say “change the system” you need alternatives. What is a practical electorally possible alternative that you would advocate for? \s\s8) Citizens United. \s“He’s lying” \sLOLOL LIBS OWNEd!!!! Flawless logic there. Again your telepathic powers know no bounds \s\s9) Overtime Pay: “We need healthcare” \sGood thing he supports a public option! \s\s10) Drug reform “He’s lying/crime bill” \sI wonder who else voted for the crime bill... I think his name was Barnyard? Barnyard Saunders? \s\sI have no reason to think Biden is lying here unless your telepathy says otherwise \s\s11) prison ban: Yep. Clear voter for Biden right there \s\s12) antitrust: wow whenever you are confronted by the fact that Biden would actually be super progressive your telepathy saves you!!! \s\s13) “We need eco-austerity AND 100% green is impossible” \sUmm ok. Literally every climate scientist ever thinks eco austerity is dogshit policy. Transitioning to renewables/nuclear is sound feasible and imperative \s\s14) “Doubt he’ll do anything/states already doing” \sWhat possible reason do you have to doubt him on this? And yeah blue states might already be doing it but if it’s issued at the federal level then red states can’t refuse\s\s15) Your telepathy strikes again \s\s16) Bankruptcy plan: ok another clear reason to vote him in \s\s17) Paris accords: ah yes. His other climate policy is too extreme but that isn’t enough. Ofc \s\s18) “being a democrat is bad” I guess that’s why people of color consistently vote Democrat \s\s19) draws a meaningless distinction between capitalists and commoners. Only acknowledging exploitation not benefit \s\s20) I wonder how “no compromise” works out in electoral politics. Jesus how childish are you \s\s21) Pro-trade is really good policy. Empirically it reduces emissions increases GDP and reduces prices for those “commoners” you care about \s\s22) better than nothing \s\s23) more people covered is bad??? Lol ok. Again with the no compromise shit. That’s not how politics works. You need to be prepared to make compromises or nothing gets done. \s\s24) ending subsides is good policy and trade allows alternative energy investment.

How can you *like* a politician? It doesn't make sense.It's not that we like Bernie for the sake of it. We like most of his policies so amidst years of politicians not caring (90% of them) and others playing the populist game to then go and betray what they stood for (Obama and Trump) it is reassuring to see someone with an extensive record of actually caring for its constituents and fighting for the things they consider right even if it is unpopular. That's Bernie right there.\s\sThat's also why when he decided to stop fighting and rally behind Biden many of us criticized him for it. I think he does think Trump is the greatest evil of all and that may be true but had he pushed Biden either win himself or get some concessions out of him we wouldn't be criticizing him right now. It's sad really because he goes out of his way to get Biden elected and yet if Biden loses they'll put the blame on him and if he wins he'll get none of the credit.It's the policies more than the personWhen the country is falling apart at the seams and most politicians don’t care those that do will stand out.\s\s(Or something something follow the leader)Very occasionally there can be a likeable one \s\sThere's a uk mp (career politican which kinda sucks) that just got elected and instantly made their entire social media presence about the ridiculous gift baskets they receive from corporations along with ""requests"" from the corporations \s\sZarah Sultana if anyone caresPoor dude never had a chanceLol you are subbed to neoliberal no you are not.I mean with a mocking SN like F33ltheBern and his like 2 months on redditand most of his karma on neolibs subs it's pretty obvious this guy is trollin.not subbed there.

The line got to be hours long. Hours many college students couldn’t spare. Don’t tell me about “low youth turnout”. The youth turned out. It was our election system that turned them away.The 13% was from the total electorate from which youth voters make up 16%This should be at the top. But it's not divisive so this sub doesn't care.People 18-30 make up ~16% of the total U.S. population but closer to ~25% of the eligible voter population (i.e. only counting over-18s). So being only 13% of the actual voter turnout is a huge underperformance.Why is this a own? Explain it to me. \s\sA low youth turn out was one of the reasons the Dems lost their super majority under Obama. If anything there should be panic bell ringing.\s\sAlso I am sure none of the Voter suppression and disenfranchisement of the youth had nothing to do with it /sNeolibs don’t understand nuance nor youth voter rates. \s\sThey just go “haha stupid progressives!” And then “Biden is progressive!!!! Why no vote!!!!”""JUST GO VOTE!!!"" they scream face turning beet red.\s\s[Me trying to vote.](https://i.imgur.com/Y73sw2H.mp4)They voted for Obama who then pivoted turned right wing and basically told much of the base that helped him get elected to fuck off.\s\sBiden's trying the same thing but he isn't as slick a liar as Obama.>Why is this a own?\s\sNothing says such. You should be voting instead of not voting. Pretty clear message.Well they're sure not showing up for Biden either so what's your point here?The post also ignores the rampant voter suppression as well. Neolibs love to bitch about republican voter suppression when they do the exact same thing to their constituents. Democrat specialty is doing exactly what they accuse republicans of. \s\s https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/stop-blaming-young-voters-not-turning-out-sanders/608137/\s\shttps://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/487383-ocasio-cortez-rampant-voter-suppression-contributed-to-sanderss-loss-in\s\shttps://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/voter-suppression-alive-and-well-on-super-tuesday-2020/Their point is they can't let go of Bernie. Literally all they post about is Bernie. It's like a weird middle school relationship where they show affection towards Bernie by being really mean to him lmaoFirst they go “haha you don’t vote we dont need to appease you!” Then “you better vote for Biden or else!!!! You’re literally trump!” \s\sThen they go “Damn Bernie bro’s! It’s their fault we lost in 2020 2016 and 2004 and 2000!”This also ignores the massive effort to prevent people from voting closing polling stations requiring ID but not counting college IDs and the rigging of electronic voting machines.>“haha you don’t vote we do need to appease you!”\s\sThat's literally what democracy is. When people stay home and silent their voices aren't heard. No one said the above but voters chose to do nothing. Vote.Multiple things can be true at the same time.This has been reposted like 30 timesYou hate to see it lolDid it ever occur to you that maybe most people don’t want the revolution?Kind of like that one back in the 1700s.*looks at the revolution in the streets*Lets not lump everyone in the younger generations with the progressives. Sanders did a good job in getting the left wing of the young generation involved in politics. He just hit a cap of potential voters willing to go as far left as himself. The parts of the younger generation who were not galvanized by Sanders are likely far less inclined to vote as far left when they do start voting.That’s pretty much exactly where I am in terms of I’m definitely voting but I wasn’t really galvanized by SandersWhat's the difference between centrists pointing out the not at all contested fact that Bernie got fewer votes and alt-right fascists pointing out the not at all contested 13/50 statistic?  There isn't any.\s\sIn both cases the statistic is implied to be a justification of their world view which their opposition can't account for when in actuality a deeper dive into the underlying issues behind these non contested facts shows quite the opposite. But the goal here is to shut down discussion not facilitate it.[deleted]https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.htmlAh yes the 1994 crime bill.

Enough to cancel candidates whose policies would help the working class and protect marginalized groups. \s\sEven though half of US high school students don't even matriculate to a 4-year college.Biden would forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two and four-year public colleges/universities for people who make less than $125000/year.  \s  \sThe difference between him and Sanders is Sanders is the one who wants to forgive the debt of rich kids most of whom happen to be white (eerily similar to the Southern Strategy).

It's the same thing.\s\sThey harass you if you question dear leader or the system they will violently argue crazy opinions with no factual basis and surprise surprise Trump or Scientology is all that is standing in the way of annihilation.\s\sBoth claim that they are the last defense against chaos distrust science and believe that faith alone will save them.\s\sAnd again both are violent.  Scientology has literal fight clubs and random beatings are not uncommon.  The Proud Boys Boogaloo Boys and state militias are all an extension of that cult the difference being that they are almost exactly clones of the Brown shirts.\s\sBest way I ever heard it summed up is ""A trump voter will let Trump shit in their mouth if a liberal has to smell it.""What was with the completely irrelevant gender rant? Neither of the first two videos mentioned genders at all and then Cult Member #41765 comes out the gate swinging with ""MEN SHOULD PLAY MEN'S SPORTS!""""Are y'all with the cult?""\s\s""Uhm no honey you just don't understand that he is all that is standing between us and our freedo...""\s\s""Yup this is it.""\s\s&#x200B;\s\sAlso side note he was standing between us and our freedom is one pretty good self burn.You can tell that she barely has a brain cell with the way she keeps attacking how the girl looks.\s\sLike how hard is it for these people to understand that pointing out features they find unattractive doesn't negate the point the other person is making? I don't care if a grotesque bridge troll was making the tiktok if its a fair logical point I'm here for it. \s\sThis girl reminds me too much of Trisha Paytas in this as well. Also separation of church and state is completely fucking lost on these ""patriots.""\s\sEdit - when I say she reminds me of Trisha I do not mean to imply Trisha has these viewpoints whatsoever! Just her mannerisms and way of speaking struck me as Trisha-like. Some people let me know that she's not that bad as this girl which I agree!How the fuck did it go from idolizing presidents to women and men‘s sports???!Holy shit she's so fucking dumb. Realize this is her PREPARED response which she could have filmed repeatedly until she was happy enough to post it.And went for attacks on the way she looks rather than her position.Damn her response was like if Miss South Carolina was like 200% more bigoted. Completely fumbling over her words and failing to make a point. \s\s""I think he was all that was standing between me and my freedom."" Really? You think Donald Trump was standing between you and your freedom? Well I'd agree with you there but I'm not so sure you'd agree with you.Lol & she said she thinks God is in control. So wouldn't that mean that he put Biden in office?She also turned off/ removed all comments from most her videos then restricted who could comment.  But they're the ones apparently being censored and have no free speech.I love how every time a Trump supporter doesn’t have a legitimate argument to stand by they start attacking the other person’s physical appearance. \s\sI am 100% convinced that 100% of Trump supporters are high school bullies that never grew up and I have yet to see anything to prove me otherwise.This comment needs more upvotes.

Wait a second does this lady not like who God installed as President????Wow this hog's biggest issues are muh freedumb and making sure we teach those degenerate transes their place.I couldn’t even make it through the response. Her snarkiness is just tooooo much for meIt’s honestly pretty sad to think about the level of anxiety that must be felt constantly to be in this mindset. Truly believing the only person between you and losing your freedom is Trump and going off on a non sequitur about gender - there is just that constant fear of a changing world.Lmao her ""insults"" or so weak. You look like you've been holding your breath? And in her first video she's got tons of makeup on and you know damn well she took it all off for the second video just so she could make that jab at the other girl's makeup.So she believes in freedom. Exepct god is in control except for freedom to express your gender except freedom of speech because she blocked comments from her video. Pretty sure she just ""believed"" in TrumpAnd disabled the comments so that she doesn't have to answer for her ignorance!She has those crazy eyes. Like no help for crazy eyes.This pained me to watch“I believe that there are genders”Darn the video is removed I think.aaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone.I literally came here to say I bet getting owned this bad rolled off her like rain off a duck glad to see I was right.

Personal attacks Gish gallop and non-sequitur points that aren’t remotely related to what the other girl said.\s\sWhere did 2 genders and male and female sports come from?

Well hold on dear I can only tell you how fucking stupid you are about 1 topic at a time.At no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul.""he was last thing standing between me and my freedom"" she probably thought that sounded really stoic or something but it really just sounds like she's admitting that Trump was literally getting between the people and our freedoms. \s\sBut I just really want to know what ""freedoms"" she's talking about. Have any of you had your freedoms taken away in the last two weeks? I haven't. \s\sAlso I find it ironic that she's going on about ""freedom"" and then says ""god is in control and I will follow him"". Honey are you free or are you a slave to your religion? Which is it?(unprompted) *""I think there's genders and women have a certain role and that god is in control and...""*\s\sMy b I didn't realize you were already beyond help.Did she take it down?

She couldn't even come up with a shitty argument. She went right into weird gender rhetoric.As someone who isn't american its absolutely fucking nuts how diehard some Americans are for politicians.\s\sCan't really talk for other countries but in Ireland the general consensus is to hate politicians some are better than others but ultimately nobody likes tax collectors.\s\sEdit: Thanks so much for the gold! And I've got to say it's been cool reading about all the different takes people have on the subject.As an American I also find it absolutely fucking nuts. Also there’s a thing called Fenno’s paradox. No one likes government officials (like 15% approval ratings) but senators have a 90% incumbency (retention) rate.\s\sEdit: spelling[deleted]France here we could have the best of the best and still try to cut his head off.In France we actively hate every single politicians with passion vote for the next one then hate them tooI have friends whom had never mentioned politics before claiming they are die hard republicans and treating Trump as a deity. It boggles the mind.I'm from another country in Europe and I also find it absolutely insane. This is why the world thinks US politics are a shitshow because it's always such an extreme duality that you don't see anywhere else. It's always with us or against us peace or war live with us or die against us. There is no middle-ground. If you're an american wondering why the world can't look away this is part of the reason why (amongst many others). For someone from the outside this is insanity. Literal insanity.You haven't seen indians masterbating over their prime minster then crazy bunch.As a Canadian I just vote for whoever aligns with my beliefs/opinions/etc the most.  Is there one party that does that more than the others?  Yes and I vote for them most often.  Have I voted for other parties?  Yes a few times.  I don't understand at all being a voter and being on a political ""team"".  It makes no sense to me.In germany shit like this is unthinkable too.\s\s..ecxept the AfD people of course.It's all about personalities in America. I was a kid for Bush but for Obama it was a HUGE deal and although flags were a bit far lots of people wore HOPE shirts and hats. He was and is an icon to many people for his accomplishment of getting so far in the American Government system. Trump already had a huge fan base tv star property mogule book writer whether you want to believe those things or not he was somebody's dream come true and people really wanted to show they were proud of him and we're with him. Biden doesn't have the same personality. He didn't really do much other than NOT be Trump. If Bernie Sanders made it to the primaries 100% there would be more ""Bernie"" merch because he has a huge social following people like and want him albeit not as far as Trump but maybe a little more past the Obama sensation just due to Americans fascination with pop culture. When and if AOC were to ever run I'm sure there will be a similar following as the Obama era but Trump was just special.Yeah no one likes politicians here in England either at least that's been my experienceI'd like to suggest you to read about the current political party in power in India. You'd be awe & shocked by the fanaticism for the PM here.worse than Brazilian football fansKorean here. We have a group of ultra conservatives who worship both President Park as gods. Scary part is these circus freaks raided S.K. parliament building back in 2019 to block a legislation iirc.Could it be the two party system and the celebrity status of candidates?It's not just politicans but also athletes and actors.Idk man. Taxes are pretty neat. We got roads schools water electric and shit. Fuck it. Tax me more. Gimme taxes instead of health insurance. Gimme some taxes instead of ISPs while you’re at it. Suck my fucking money up goddamnit. I don’t need that money if I’m paying less to you than my absurd fucking premiums.\s\sThen Again. Idek if you guys really have the same problems in Ireland.Czech Republic here. A few years ago there was a poll about the respectability of professions ""politician"" finished dead last behind ""cleaning lady"". I'm not even joking.As an American myself it is absolutely fucking nuts. What I find to be most crazy about it is that it happened over the pan of about 5 years. Before trump was in office no other republican senator or president nominee hell or president got anywhere near the level of support trump got. It’s frightening how someone many people see as an absolute buffoon idiot was able to mass manipulate millions of people. It’s a complicated issue with many reasons behind why this is happening but I think a huge one is republicans thought that they were dying out and trump made them believe he wanted to give them one last fighting chance. Maybe this is all obvious to some but I just had to put it out therePolitic is pretty much a sport for us. We pick a side and root for them and hate the other teamSame in the UK. \s\sYou just get to pick between two maybe three shower of cunts.\s\sYou just gotta pick the ones you hate the least.Truer words have never been spoken.\s\sMehole Martin is no better than Leo.As someone who IS American yup.I'm Brazilian and lemme tell you Bolsonaro supporters are JUST as nuts. I wonder if this is a right wing thing.As an American it's terrifying.  The Trumpism insanity has roots and volume now.  What should literally be a ""cult following"" in a small minority sense has become a literal cult following with millions clutching to conspiracy theories and blatant lies.  They have lost touch with reality and it has devolved into literal domestic terrorism.  Some are willing to die on a hill of lies for someone who doesn't give two shits about them.  Again fucking terrifying.I thought it was funny when Mako and Bolin’s grandmother idolized the evil queen sad to see it happen in real life.But Higgins has good dogs.You wanna talk about nuts? There are *Canadians* that are die hard trump supporters.What is extra nuts are the religious ones that deify these politicians saying they're chosen/sent by God that they're doing their job in the name of God ect. *The church has no fucking place being part of the state.*\s\sIt baffles me that these are my fellow Americans. That I share a country with these people.Brit here. (Sorry about everything.) I used to think the monarchy had to go. But I’ve come to believe that it serves a useful purpose by sucking up the fandom of the kind of berks who’d otherwise find themselves a Trump to wave their flag for.Same mate sameThe weirdest thing in the whole world is calling yourself a fan of a president he shouldn’t be a celebrity you can agree with them and appreciate the things they do but it’s a political party not one man why the fuck would you be a fan?????Because we wanted a celebrity president and that's what we received. Since he's a celebrity he gets worshiped like one.Being a fan of any politician is stupid if you are desperate to be a part of a group of supporters pick a sports team.>why the fuck would you be a fan?????\s\sBrainwashed or brain dead. Dealer's choice.No idea. But both parties do this.Biden “fans”?! What the fuck do you think this is a baseball game?They just prove how unstable they are. They admit to being “fans” of a corrupt tax and draft dodging racist rapist fucking lying baboon.[deleted]It may just be personal experience but I have actually seen a lot of Biden fans who aren't willing to admit he's done shady things in the past. Both sides are really fucked up from these recent elections but I only ever see people criticizing the radical right (I'm not talking about the radical right criticizing the left I mean sensible people like the girl in the video).I am a fan of him making politics boring again.  Thank you Mr. President.I don't know who needs to hear this but apparently it's about 74 million people.Bruh my uncle shared the same thing as a post on FB. someone replied with the exact opposite that you said. Something like how 80 million people have their head stuck up their ass or something like that.Playing devil's advocate I'll say it's more like 55 million (75%). That's how many Republicans still believe the election was stolen in [a CNN poll](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-joe-biden-won-election-legitimately-poll-1562343) from after the Capitol insurrection. These people are totally in the cult. \s\sThe other 25% might be selfish assholes and/or idiots for voting Trump - but they're perfectly fine with dumping him shitting on Biden for 4 years and voting for the next garbage candidate the GOP puts up. They're awful but they're not in the cult.My favorite thing about 2020 is that two Republicans in my family actually left the party prior to the election and became Independents. One of them even voted for Biden. They had spent a few years telling my wife and me about how snowflaky we are...but were done with their party by early/mid 2020. One more left after the election when Trump just would not stop lying about his loss.[deleted]There's also the algorithm too! I like videos of Hank Green explaining shit and now all my for you videos are science and interesting facts type stuff. I don't think a trump supporter is getting a lot of Biden people in their algorithm in the same way I never get Trump people in mine.It’s also because those social media platforms use algorithms that show people what they like watch comment on etc. So if you watch things that support trump you will be shown more trump supporting content.Yeah first thing that came to my mind too. Of course social media is showing you what you want to see lmaoThis. It’s how we get idiots like this. They exist in an echo chamber and that becomes their reality.Not disregarding her point; which is fire. Her shirt is awesome.Strange Planet.  \s\sCheck out @nathanwpylestrangeplanet on Instagram.I mean that the main reason I posted it.Check out r/nathanpyle 😊Im hyped about the fact that she actually didnt put the mic into her face but just made sure to lift it off her shirt and then speak into it at the reasonable and expected distance. 10/10 knows how mics workHere in Brazil is the same thing with Bolsonaro. The man is obviously corrupt and stupid but people WORKSHIP him. Is patheticBolsonaro is a terrible president but come on far leftists idolize Lula the same way the far right idolizes Bolsonaro. It's a shit show all aroundPutin?I voted for Biden but I'm not a Biden fan. I'm an Alabama Crimson Tide and New Orleans Saints fan. Biden isn't a fucking sports team. He's a politician. And this isn't a fucking game Karen.I have literally never seen a politician turned into such a spectacle. Trump has taken a prestigious position and turned it into the equivalent of a trailer park supervisor election. People fly dozens of Trump flags and bill board sized signs in their yards like they’re Halloween or Christmas decorations.\s\sIt’s no wonder the only people who support Trump are racist/bigots who are wealthy enough to benefit off him or are just straight trailer trash\s\sEdit: my favorite part is seeing people defend Trump and trying to guess what subreddit they frequent. It’s usually gaming subs/alt right shit holes/and conservative subs.i'll take lahey any dayI'll look at Ricky's ass after... No \s\s\sSam's on drugs everybody!Holy shit literally every subreddit devolves into this. It’s so annoyingShould have seen places when Obama was running. There was hope posters on every city corner hell my cousin who was 23 back then sold so much obama shit that he was able to pay rent cause you know the housing problem back then.\s\s>People fly dozens of Trump flags and bill board sized signs in their yards like they’re Halloween or Christmas decorations.\s\sThier called fanatics every politician got one one way or another.Trump's out of office get over it dudeEven the merch itself is trashy. I've seen houses around me flying this ""[flag](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YJH2K6R/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_Y13XZSQZCG5AZT4ACSSF)""You must of forgot about Reagan the devil.>It’s no wonder the only people who support Trump are racist/bigots who are wealthy enough to benefit off him or are just straight trailer trash\s\sImagine being this politically illiterate. If you paid for school go get a refund.Didn't like all of wall street back Biden?There are people around me still making a point of flying Trump 2020 flags. One guy a street over took down his Trump/Pence campaign sign which was still up in JANUARY scratched Pence off of it after the insurrection and then hung it over his garage.\s\sThese people are outright deranged and the rest of us need to remember that not only are they cultists worshipping and idolizing a con man they've proven multiple times over that at least some of them are devoted enough to that cult to violently defend it from any criticism.\s\sTread very lightly with these MAGA cultists they run the gamut from obnoxious to deadly and it's often not easy to distinguish between the types in a heated moment.I've seen one ~~Biden~~ flag for a Democratic candidate since 2016.\s\sI've seen hundreds of Trump flags IN ONE MINUTE because they were parading at 25mph on a public freeway (against traffic laws). There are still flags up in my city.\s\sThey're patheticI still see trump signs even though trump isn’t president anymore.[deleted]Sit back and watch the fun!I just got here and I’m not sure if If I want to see them at all...So the last comment she made “get a new personality “ hilarious. It made me think of my zingers and how they all came from my dad. Now I’m wondering if she has a parent with a sharp wit too.   Hahaha my dad would always say they are a “waste of skin”. Like we are in short supply of it? I don’t know but I think it’s funny.I like you mango muffin. You know what's crazy? I had a box of mango muffins like 3 months ago for the first time ever. They even had like tiny chewy pieces of mango in them. They were delicious. \s\sThanks for being delicious mango muffin :)Why do all Trump supporters look like their mother drank while pregnant?Because their mothers drank while pregnant.You just answered your own question. This is the crowd that doesn’t have the common decency to wear masks during a pandemic to spite liberals. You think they are going to let a little fetus and doctor tell them what to smoke and drink while pregnant?Most people I know of who voted for him dont even support him they just think hes less bad than trumpI heard this a lot too. “I don’t really like Biden or Harris but it’s the better option of the two” \s\sWhich makes me think we should get rid of bipartisanship and we’re given more options for elections.I mean she makes great points and all but wouldn’t social media algorithms have a huge part in that too?\s\sLike the algorithms are made to show you content you want to see they aren’t made to show you content you **don’t** want to see. If she really hasn’t seen any “fans” or Biden voters on her social media it’s probably because she’s not at all democratic and the algorithms likely picked up on that so they’re showing her more republican-side posts.\s\s^(I’m from Alberta and my family is quite conservative but no one likes Jason Kenny) ^(—the leader of our provincial gov and none of us really like Trudeau. So what kind of content do I see? Posts bashing Kenny and memes of Trudeau being ridiculous.)Yes an no. Algorithms might hide the few posts that would otherwise show praise for Biden. But for the most part people aren’t posting praise and support for Biden simply because like she said” we aren’t fans or in a cult. So yeah algorithms would hide the tiny minority that might be posting praise but the point still holds in 99% of cases. Nice Nathan Pyle shirtAs a republican I agreeObviously you're a Republican because you're not a Trump fan. You're a political supporter of a party.\s\sThat's how it's supposed to work. Someone should tell these Trump idiots to grow a brain and have some pride themselves.If you haven’t disowned the traitor party yet you’re no better.I fucking hate Biden and still voted for him because the alternative was so much worse. Not going to be wearing a blue hat for 4 years or putting up giant Biden flags everywhere.r/murderedbywords. \s\sVery well spoken red haired lady.I love this woman. Also the #bidenisnotmypresident hashtag is hilarious. If you live in America the person who’s the president is your president whether you like them or not. If you don’t want the president to be your president move to another fucking country.I love commenting the exact thing they all said 4 years ago. “Whether or not you voted for him I’m he’s your president now so deal with it or move” except I like to add “but thanks to Trump Americans are toxic and plague carriers so no one will let you in)Guess political posts are unlocked on this sub now\s\sAnyway really great point if it weren’t for the fact that I see social media posts constantly praising Biden and celebrating his every action while ignoring the bad just like idiots did with Trump.Great comeback! Great explanation also they do need to have things explained to them in a simple wording they can understand!Also your algorithm is fit to what you like. If you look at 10 pro-trump posts it’s gonna continue to suggest those types of posts. That’s why you only see your bubble.suddenly reddit forget the bernie cult exists 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 your generation needs to take over. I’m 50. And most of the people my age and about 99% of the people over 50 need to step back and get out of the way. I’m sorry you inherited the aftermath of a pandemic global climate crisis racism sexism and phobias. It’s a lot. But I believe in you to make a difference and exact change.As a zoomer I think listening and being open to new ideas (which is what you’re doing great job👌)is better than just being out of the way entirely. Inheriting the role of the elder instead of playing the role of the revolutionary (genX) like you all may be used to. At some point in the future we will also be apologetic for our mistakes as a generation so at that point I hope we take the role as elders responsibly too.I'm 47 and I have been lecturing the fuck out of everyone on my Facebook on how out of touch they are and how in touch younger people are.\s\sI'm back at university. I was in my human rights lecture today and the shit coming out of the mouths of 20yos is shit people my age and older couldn't come up with if you gave them a week to study and put a gun to the head of their children. Younger generations get it. I think older people are scared just because they know how ignorant and unsophisticated they are.\s\sIt's not our job to correct people our age anymore. We're a lost fucking cause. It's sunken cost fallacy. We need to support and empower younger people. Honestly at this point I'd rather have a conversation with 20-somethings than people my age. Most of the people my age and older are broken as fuck. It's a waste.\s\sYou and I are the exception. There's not many of us. And I fear our numbers are shrinking never to come back.I can't make exact change only round.Its crazy these people can't even comprehend caring about politics without treating it like a sporting eventThe actual answer to her question is because of the insanely accurate Tik Tok algorithm. After a good amount of time on the app you end up in your own personally curated echo chamber which is pretty problematic honestly.Yeah this is the real reason and I'm actually surprised more people aren't pointing this out. Most social media platforms are designed this way now.\sAnd it's not just Trump fans the same could be said for Flat-Earthers and any number of other cult like groups originating on the internet.Except Bernie. I will forever blindly follow himThat pretty much means you don’t really listen to what Bernie Sanders has said and done for decades.\s\sHe doesn’t want you to blindly follow him. He promotes reading talking to your neighbors and friends and constantly challenge him yourself and others.\s\sThat’s the whole point. Following a political leader will never evolve into a working class movement.The president doesn't pass legislation he signs bills into law.Yeah that kind of annoyed me as well. Didn't anyone watch School House Rock?How do you idolize any politician for that matter??90% of people who vote for a candidate can't even name two policies from that candidate. And popular ones like abortion and stimulus checks don't count.\s\sIn 2016 people voted for Trump because anyone was better than Clinton whereas those who voted for Clinton only did so because it was better than Trump and they couldn't vote for who they wanted which was Sanders. 2020 same deal. People voted for Biden purely to get Trump out of office and vice versa. As far as I'm concerned both extreme sides are in a cult. The social climate with this has gotten crazy and God forbid you sit somewhere in the middle because then you're either a traitor or coward apparently.\s\sIt's hilarious that she had the audacity to say that Biden supporters aren't afraid to point out when he's doing something wrong or untoward. Really? Where do you see that? There have been several issues with him already and I haven't seen any of the Biden supporters on my pages call him out. And Trump supporters aren't exempt either. They refuse to see how that man did anything wrong while in office politically or socially.Both are annoying as fuckEveryone is so cringeyVapid bitch does need a new personality.I thought people voted for Biden because his name isn't Donald Trump.Absolute perfection. Especially with how fucking stupid the trumpsupporter loser is.“No president is worthy of blind praise and support” \s\s\sr/neoliberal sweating nervouslyUh oh—she said “pass legislation” but I’m pretty sure she meant “get things done through executive decree. Like a King.”Lmaooo both of them make me cringeShe’s so right. It’s the biggest cult the USA has had including some religions.This was so satisfying to watchSpittin faxxxxxDoes it drive anyone else nuts when they can only speak in sentence fragments before cutting on the camera to create a really jerky watching/listening experience? Can someone explain why they do this?This happens because TikTok videos can only be a minute long so they have to cut it to shit to make it fit.Yup. You go girl. Absolutely so amazingly spoken. You’re absolutely right. It’s WORSHIP when you praise & can’t critique the president & it is so incredibly limiting & unfair.I 100% agree with the sentiment but there's plenty of circles where Bernie and others were cult-like worshipped too. \s\sEdit: [2nd most upvoted post on r/pics this week.](https://i.redd.it/nunq9xyjtce61.jpg) Not very politics related either is it... \s\sLet's focus more on the actual content of the politics people.Don't forget the AOC crowd. Literally has more upvotes from a single tweet on one subreddit than Trump passing legislation on t_d. Let's not forget the Bernie memes either.It's called populism and it isn't unique to the right. Trump has just elevated it to another level and weaponized it.HUGE BERNIE FAN HERE! I love the guy he got screwed out of being the Democratic Nomination twice. That being said I probably wouldn’t have peeled the bumper sticker off of my car but other than that I still wouldn’t be flying flags or making Tick Tocks about the guy.Obama had some really die-hard fans when he ran too. I think the truth is people weren't really excited about Biden they just wanted Trump gone. They didn't vote for Biden they voted against Trump. I thought that was pretty obvious.Couldn't have said it better if I went to collegeLove her Nathan Pyle shirt.The Trump supporters beat any other fandom in rabid unyielding devotion any day.\s\sThe Harry Potter fans can point out plot holes or criticise JKR as a person the Sherlock fans will admit the writing tailed off later on but Trump simps and fanboys cannot speak or hear a bad word against ’their President’.The other reason you don't see it on Facebook is Facebook curates the content so you will rarely see content that is offensive to you so that they can keep you on the platform to show you ads. Its also why Instagram shows me cats ass and titties.It's worse in India. Not only do Prime Ministers get worshipped as deities... but so do local and state politicians to varying degrees.The other much bigger reason is that everyone lives in a bubble.  \s\sTikTok doesn't want to show you stuff that you don't want to see.  Neither does Facebook!God that young lady soothes my soul. The youth of this nation are incredibly inspiring. You all are gonna leave a helluva historical legacy. I can feel it.Can’t wait to say this shit to my ultra conservative family at the next holiday dinner post-pandemic.this is what happens when you push religions too much and lack of education. Worst part is that they will reproduce and try to pass down their ""values"" I hope the children will be able to break the cycleOne reason is also that I think a lot of people who voted for Biden were really just voting *against* trump not *for* BidenBoth look like characters from The Moomins-universe.I literally just saw somebody ask this question on my Facebook.If they are religious most religions warn you not to worship false idols... yet they worship Trump blindly.She spittin facts thoIt’s ironic the post right after this one was one of Obama.\s\sNow I think that the trump worship is way out of hand. And personally I criticized Obama when he was deserving of it. But still people fucking LOVE Obama. \s\sHe is one charismatic mfer to be fair.ok let’s not act like the left doesn’t idolize politicians eitherLOUDERGirl #2 has neopolitain makeup.Still waiting on all that Biden criticism ya'll talking about. I don't even have to look to tell you the entire top posts for the day in /r/politics are 50% still shitting on Trump and 50% pro-Biden with no criticism.OK so while this may be true there is **always** a cult of personality around these people Democrats or Republicans. ""we"" in this instance isn't everyone...look at the literal ""messiah like"" focus on President Obama. Hell this time the current VP said she thought Biden was both a rapist and a racist but she then changed her mind to both support him and run with him...Trumpism is certainly uniquely awful for our modern times but the hero worship of those in public office is pretty easy to see even if not for the lady replying in this instance./r/murderedbywordsr/politics has finally invaded TikTokCringe... Rest In PeaceEloquentFemale Trump supporters sure do have a certain uhhh look about them don’t they?Awesome response!!!Damn she just went OFF on this ladySaved damn destroyed herThank you 🙏🏽What freedoms do these Trumpers keep referring to?I’m a leftist not a liberal but decided to bite the bullet and vote for Biden. With that said I frequently see liberals idolizing and worshipping liberal politicians. Obviously not nearly to the extent that trump supporters do with the huge trump flags bumper stickers and edginess etc. but still they frequently defend liberal politicians from any criticism no matter how legitimate. I can’t tell you how many times good faith leftist criticism of liberal politicians is dismissed as “Oh what so you’re a trump supporter???” Or “You’re a Russian bot!” Or “why do you want to help republicans??” So I don’t entirely agree with this person but she’s right that liberals aren’t as obsessed with their candidates as the trump supporters./r/murderedbywordsMy ex was a Trump fanboy dreaming of walking around in a MAGA hat.

They never considered what was going on in the background of the show.You're being downvoted but you're right. Time and time again he went on stage and said things the fans wanted to hear like calling for Gov Whitmer to be locked up. Same with his lawyer Guiliani calling for a ""Trial by Combat"" before the storming of the Capitol Building. His boss puts on a show so why shouldn't he?\s\sA lot of his supporters follow him personally because he appealed to them on a personal level rather than being a normal run of the mill candidate.Can't be the only one to see save our chilren....The Venn diagram of Trump supporters Qanon antimaskers and antivaxxers is a near-perfect circle.If it’s about the role of president where were all these MAGA heads with Bush Cheney McCain Palin etc etc etc. they are TRUMP obsessed it has nothing to do with his role or what he’s done.Loving your country should mean you're critical of its leaders.

Not having any affection means that they are so happy about throwing Trump out it doesn't even matter who it is. When Obama was elected for example massive support was shownAm I the only one that finds the cut after every sentence jarring?LOVE THIS!!Because we arent fucking insane?I can definitely tell the first woman is not running on a full deck.But they're both one personLast I checked Presidents don't pass legislation.Yep!Nick kroll plays this character on big mouthWell Said!  In Australia we don’t vote people in. We vote people out!Very well explained.AmenI think they are so stuck in the past. With Obama people genuinely liked the guy. He was kind well-spoken and a charming fella. Future trump supporters saw that and took it to the extreme while completely missing the point. \s\sYou can find someone charming and a good person and appreciate a good front over the buisness neither of which represented Trump. They saw how americans treated Obama and thought they were blindly in love with the guy as if he was an evangelical deity . They tried to mimic the same with trump but immediately took it too far and became rabid fans wearing t-shirts with trumps screaming face shooting missiles out of his eyes towards a middle eastern village called ‘abortionland’ which had a house labeled ‘Biden & Harris residence’I like how she said “some of you are unwell” since not everyone who voted for Trump is unwell. Sad thing is that a majority of people who are Trump supporters don’t look at the bad as well as the good and so they blindly praise.We didn't vote for Biden bc we like him. We were forced to bc Trump. It could have literally been anyone. Now that he is president we don't like him. We are just happy Trump is gone.I've personally (I will stand corrected if proven otherwise) yet to see any of his voters critique him on his crime bill in the 90sLol spot on..Exactly! Get rich or.... shit I don’tBecause *no one* fangirled over Obama for 8 years right? XD Good Lord.

I worked in retail and spoke to plenty of people who complained about his policies and yet they had voted for him. It was when the economy was hit pretty bad and a lot of people were upset and hurting. Maybe it was just my town but people spoke out against him during his two terms. Nothing like this Trump ""I'll murder for my president"" vibe.Oh boy those psychology classes really paid off this is just a simple ""halo effect"" that has made so many trump supporters such idiots when it comes to worshipping that orange man.it's unsettling  how good that mic soundsfinally\s\sBased Politically Engaged peopleThis.Cenk is a piece of shit change my mindHere in Australia the conservatives are just as stupid and worship the dirt pollies walk onFucking preach young lady!!!MIC DROP\s\s\--I mean tiny earbud mic attachment thingy dropWould it be wrong to trick all the cultists into sailing off on a fleet of 'trump' branded cruise ships then never letting them back into our country?  I don't think it would be that hard we just need enough money to buy some cruise ships paint them tacky gold and post a few ads on the conspiracy websites.  99% of them would be gone like that and we could move on.If only there was a way for that cult to live under dictatorship long enough to learn what countless millions died to prevent.Get a new personality boom roastedHer response is much nicer than mine. Mine would be like....\s\sTrump ran on supporting the entitled ignorant white people demographic an audience that most candidates would never target. He also relied on dishonesty and stupidity to ensure his messages excited his voters. This brought people in those demographics out into public view who had never been catered to before.

Last time I checked it was 2.2 per gallon at my local station.I pay $1.78 in North Mississippi3 dollars a US gallon is 57p a litre in the UK.\s\sOur prices are currently around £1.20-1.30 as is most of Europe.\s\sThat's upwards of 6.2 USD.\s\sEven with an increase your petrol is still half price.Long story short it's taxes. \s\sMost European nations heavily tax petrol as to encourage people to drive more economically and to encourage the use of public transportation. \s\s\sThis is part of the reason why muscle cars and massive pickups aren't so popular over here - if it costs you £80 to fuel up and you only get 10mpg you're going to be noticing it.In Poland's capital it's 1.27 USD per litre after conversion. That's 4.8 USD per freedom volume unit. I drive a hybrid for a reason 0_oExpat living in the US I drive a hot hatch here and I always bang on about how cheap the fuel is and people complain how expensive it is maybe stop driving a V8 pickup for your commute to an office job 🤦‍♂️I mean to be fair in average a American probably uses twice as much as someone in the uk on average\sEdit i am saying this to say that we spend about the same on gas if not more still due to our worse vehicles. Not saying we deserve better prices then yallAdmittedly we do get better petrol than America. \s\sThe octane level of standard petrol is 95 with premium being 98-99. American standard petrol starts at 87 with premium at 91.Even here in Thailand we pay more for Petrol than America's.Yup moved to the UK from America and was horrified. Decided to buy a hybrid to ease the financial pain. I spend less on petrol now than when I lived in the US and drove an SUV because my car now gets 85 mpg.The amount of crying in the US about the ultra-low gas prices is a source of perpetual confusion to many including me.And I promise you all the people whining own giant trucks that get 15 mpg.They're paying now what we paid in 1996In the UK we pay equivalent 7.47 USD per gallon.[deleted]But you also have public transportation. I live 6 miles - a 12 minute drive - from downtown in my mid size US city. Public transportation would take over an hour and two bus changes.Now she's inane but comparison of pump prices isn't really fair the price difference has almost everything to do with tax policy.\s\sLooks like gas/petrol is about £1.22 a litre in the UK right now. Thats £4.61 or $6.38 a gallon.  It also looks like VAT is 20% (£0.76) and the duty(tax) is £2.19 making up $4.08 of $6.38 making the actual gas cost about $2.30.  She's probably paying about $2.50 - $2.80 base (before tax) depending on what state she's in. \s\sShe and everyone else pays those taxes elsewhere that UK and Europe pays at the pump - be it in income taxes excise taxes property taxes etc.  I'd prefer the European method so people would stop buying 17 mpg SUVs to drive just themselves around but were all in the same ball park when you look at the actual gas cost.\s\sSource for UK gas price/taxes: https://www.racfoundation.org/data/uk-daily-fuel-table-with-breakdownin Europe we also mostly drive more efficient cars and not some big stupid trucks that you probably only need the space for once every like three years or so. don‘t even get me started about emissionsYeah but Imperial Gallons are 4.55 litres and US gallons are 3.79 litres. It's probably more like six bucks and change. Still more than double though.You also drive mostly diesel and much smaller enginesThe UK is also tiny and drives and quick and short. In the US we drive everywhere including up to 45 minutes to an hour for workThat thump trips me outCan’t believe I had to scroll this far to find this. All I saw was the thumb.It's like a toeClub thumbTurn that p upside down.Was wondering when someone was going to say something.Cries in Australian (paid $4.50 today and was happy. Because last time I filled up it was $6.08)[deleted]That's some Sherlock Holmes shit right there.Unless I'm thinking of another creator he also does weird math to find out how tall people are based on objects around them lolHe did well but that that isn’t the right car it’s a Pathfinder Armada or just an Armada depending on the mode year. The flare over the fender gives it away. \s\sBut it even larger and get even worse mileage lolIt’s also super unnecessary. Just divide the total cost by the gallons pumped. $70/23g = $3.04/gExcept gas prices are based off future markets and not the current one. Biden has stated he was going to be hard on fracking coming into office then cancelled the Key Stone pipeline and passed an executive order banning fracking for this next year which both would increase the price. This in addition to several states implementing tax hikes on gas as Trump was leaving office are causing the prices to spike up. I would expect gas prices to continue to rise with more green initiatives coming.I saw ""Thank Joe Biden"" figured it was another stupid Trump supporter and didn't bother doing the math.\s\sThese fuck nuts will blame Joe for every death since Covid started ignoring Trump's lack of role.All you had to do was divide the total by the number of gallons and you could have cut the length of this video down to 1/3 the lengthIn 2007 my SUV was over 100 bucks to fill up. Ill take these gas prices we got right now any day.My mom’s 2004&2006 Ford Expeditions got about 14mpg anywhere from 50-80$ was normal for her gas. Now we have a much newer and nicer Hyundai Tucson ~28 mpg and we spend about 25$ when filling up from an empty tank. \s\sThe amount she’s saved from the gas price alone has made the new car sooooo worth it> my SUV\s\sNow find the errorr/theydidthemathI mean I still don’t understand the relationship between how much gas I use and the price of gas.r/theydidthemonstermathNow do insulin.*starts laughing ends up sobbing*Thank you guy thank youThese people literally don't understand they're just advertising how stupid and brainwashed they are.\s\s\s\s""Thanks Biden for the deficit and high daily COVID deaths and high unemployment rate how dare you inherit that from another president and not fix it day one?""Prices has gone up because by this time last year oil prices started to plunge with it going to -35$ a barrel by april and has since been recovering almost hitting 60$ a barrel again.\s\shttps://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oilyou're  welcomeI just don’t understand how they can be so dumb. This time last year there was literally too much gas in rotation. The Russian and OPEC nations flooded the market with gas to fuck with American production of gas (if I recall correctly) at the same time as lockdowns began and demand for gas plummeted. It cost people jobs because oil jobs are based on future prices and they literally couldn’t GIVE away barrels of gas (the price of gas futures went negative in March  meaning it COST manufactures to give away their gas because there was nowhere in the world to store their gas). Biden didn’t make gas prices higher prices were unsustainably low last year.Bro does not understand how speculative the oil markets are. Also why did he go through identifying the car when she showed the purchase screen in her video?Also gas is a finite resource so its cost will inevitably go up over time anyway\s\sThats why I think its a good idea to switch over to electric sooner rather than later because its just going to become stupidly expensive to run gas vehicles and we have to do it anyway do why wait[inflation adjusted gas prices have been basically constant with a slight downtrend over the last 50 years](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/gasoline-prices-adjusted-for-inflation/). maybe one day they will go up due to supply limitations but not yetI would GLADLY switch to electric. But my 2017 car cost me $13k. A decent electric is at least 3 times that still for the same year when I bought  in 2018. \s\sAnd I would save on average using normal deduction and cost averages 1.2 cents a mile. And that’s at best. If anything goes wrong the electric will cost more to repair. \s\sIt would take me a whole lot of miles to make up that cost. Once they get comparable in price or close enough then we will really see the change to electric happen. \s\sBut even if we do all switch currently most power is being generated by fossil fuels. So we still have to switch to enough renewable energy there. Which we are on the way to at least.Solar power is cheaper than fossil fuels. The march to electric cars is coming the battery tech and infrastructure will steadily get there.People need to truly understand how OPEC works.Can you enlighten us?Man I'm paying 4+/gallon and we think it's cheap.[deleted]I've heard republicans claim that gas prices only go up when dems are in control.\s\sAre we just pretending the Bush43 presidency never happened?Also gas prices dropped from $4+ in 2010 to about $2.50 by the end of Obama’s administration. They dropped to below $2 during the pandemic because demand was so low. When oil prices go up during republican administrations there are lots of news stories telling us how higher gas prices = good economy.Republicans like to pretend a lot of shit didn’t happen.For my euro friends: that's 0.65 eur per liter. That's roughly half of what we pay here in Belgium.It's €1.65-75 / L in the netherlands atm. For americans that's $7.60 / gallon.Hot damn I pay £1.20/litre in UK..Also don't forget we subsidies gas to make it cheaper. So in reality you are paying much more for it always. The subsidies are literally to lower the price here but take money out of taxes. It is like giving a false price tag to make consumers feel like the president at the time or the economy is doing good but it is all an illusion. \s\sAnd then people complain when EVs get tax credits. Like BITCH so does gas.He fucked up his detective work. That's a Nissan Titan Armada which is a far larger sized suv than the pathfinder and has a gas guzzling V8 as opposed to the comparatively fuel sipping V6 found in the pathfinder/xterra. You can expect 15 mpg combined. He is correct about the ridiculousness of complaining about gas prices on a car that barely manages double digit fuel economy.\s\sEdit: meant to say ""Titan based Armada"" The Armada is based off of the same platform as the Titan pickup for the first gen. Current generation is a rebadged Nissan Patrol suv iirc.> Nissan Titan Armada \s\sThat's two different vehicles the Titan is a pickup truck and the Armada is a SUV.\s \sThat chick still dumb to complain when the '06 Armada has a 28 gallon tank so even worst.> Nissan Titan Armada \s\suw0t?Pathfinder Armada[deleted]All of that is true however Biden did cut the keystone which while not having any major physical effect on supply did cause prices to go up based on speculation. \s$3.00 is pretty high though. She might be in a state where prices are higher than national average. I dont know. Either way presidents have wayyyyy less of an impact on our every day lives than local politicians do.Gas prices are fucking complicated anyway. \s\shttps://www.thebalance.com/how-crude-oil-prices-affect-gas-prices-3306230I know this girl. She lives in Tennessee where gas prices are dirt cheap. She’s just a moron lolGas prices were going “up” prior to Biden doing anything to the keystone pipeline.\s\sHere’s the issue; gas prices by academic consensus and research aren’t affected by speculation of what a President in the US might do unless that speculation is “that President is about to bomb a major world oil supply.”\s\sOil and gas prices are almost entirely separated from American politicsMaybe but I also don't think anyone super concerned with gas prices would buy a car like that. It's just concern trolling.Love all the ‘research’ when he could’ve just looked at the initial image that showed ~$71 for ~23 gallons.>Love all the ‘research’ when he could’ve just looked at the initial image that showed \~$71 for \~23 gallons.\s\sCan't appear credible without analyzing small details because TikTokers don't know how gas prices work.\s\sArguments out of authority are my second-favorite only behind emotional arguments.I work in the oil and gas industry and that’s not exactly how it works. Biden doesn’t have to do anything to raise prices but because of his stance on drilling and fossil fuels most oil companies started making layoffs and cutting costs the moment Biden was elected. A consequence of this is raised fuel prices.The only reason oil fell was because of over production and during covid lack of demand\s\s One barrel of oil costs between 35-55$ to produce depending on location and extraction method.\s\sSince we are still highly oil dependant and oil cpmanies remain amongst the largest and most influential companies in the world... gas prices are not sustainable  at $2 ... the reality for a national average is between 2.8 and 3.2. In the short term. \s\sThough it sucks to pay more but a lower price would be detrimental to the oil and gas industry which is currently 6% of all US jobs and typically higher earming jobs. Losing jobs without replacing them with similar paying jobs in green energy would have a Negative impact on the US tax revenue and we would all suffer.The gas did go up by me. From $2.10 to $2.50.\s\sI don't know if it has to do with the Presidency or not thoughGas is shooting up everywhere. We were at 85-90 cents per litre here in Canada up until a month or so ago and now we've shot up to 115 cents. Reduced production and increased demand is the cause.Gas hasn't gone up by me so by the logic of gas prices are Biden's fault... Thanks Bidendon’t judge me for being old. I had to quit the best job I had it had benefits and all in 2005-06 I hate Bush. I had to drive 56miles round trip min wage was 6.75 hey I got a 7 cent raise my second year tho. I drove a full size suburban 4x4 I live in the mountains 40 gallon tank. My second year working at that job gas went from $1.69 to $4.29 a gallon. What the heck. If anyone is going to be blamed for high gas prices Bush did it. lol.Presidents don't control the entirety of the economy whether Bush was at fault or not. Also keep in mind that OPEC can be pretty controlling of gas pricesI got lucky and scored a $1k civic hx when gas got spendy. More than doubled the milage my roadmaster got. Paid for itself in like 2 months.Brah the number of gallons is literally shown on the gas screen the entire analysis was pointless.He shut down the keystone pipeline. That caused oil futures to rise.  The gallon price of gas is directly tied to oil futures. So yeah that policy increased the cost of gas.>He shut down the keystone pipeline\s\sFalse. It exists. You're thinking of the Keystone XL project. \s\s>So yeah that policy increased the cost of gas.\s\s🤦 https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/gasoline-prices-adjusted-for-inflation/Don’t get how don’t understand this.This guy is dumb af biden announced he would end the keystone pipeline WELL before being elected which as a result raised gas prices. So its still his faultHe doesn’t understand that oil is priced based on both current and future demand/supply dynamics and market/political signals. \s\sPlus what’s his rebuttal now when gas is 50% more expensive than in this video?He rate of consumption has no impact on the price of gas at the individual level. She is paying that much because of the size of her tank * price per gallon. Mpg will only impact the frequency of paying that much as a function of how much she drives.Did you not get that he was saying two things?\s\sThat she is a dumb person and that if gas prices are a problem for her she shouldn’t be driving a car that only gets 19 mpgI wish my Mazda had a 24 gallon tank. Would love having a 800 mile range before filling up.Somewhat unrelated but can anyone tell me the song that she's playing in the original vid?2 phut hon- kaiz remixAre we just going to forget we paid 4.50 a gallon under bush ?Yeah not likely the market is already correcting to Joe Bidens proposed policies.....\s\shttps://globalnews.ca/news/7638407/keystone-xl-pipeline-biden-podesta/amp/Yep and if you look at crude futures it dips before the election and then has risen after it.\s\sPrices of stickys and commodities don't just change for current policies  they change for any piece of information that may or may not impact the future value/availability.I'm not too sure he understands how a fuel pump works it tells you how much you've put in and then tells you how much the sale price is. So no a fuel pump doesn't detect what car you have an change the price of fuel. \s\sAlso he's correct that a bill probably hasn't been put through to directly increase the price but prices can fluctuate depending on trade circumstances and prospective futures in supply and demand. Biden could have an influence if he's said something which fuel stations believe could lead to an increase in demand or lack in supply but I don't know because I live in Australia. \s\sAre the fuel prices expensive compared to us? \s\sWell one US gallon is worth 3.785 litres meaning you pay $1.27 USD per litre whereas here in Australia today the average price is $1.30 AUD or $1.01 USD so yes fuel is about 30 cents more in America but it's a bit more complicated because you have to compare a million different variables to see if the fuel price is unreasonable which if you ask the average Twitter user fuel is extremely cheap and should be $50 a litre but if you ask the average airliner they'll say it's extremely expensive and should be $0.01 a litre. Lots to think about. Wonder if it'll ever catch up to normal folk who can't fork out $30k on a brand new electric car and have to use a conventional car I also wonder at what point the returns you see from using a car diminish. There was a teacher who couldn't afford a car nor the upkeep who had to catch a stupid amount of buses to go to work thus meaning she had to wake up at 4am and taught classes extremely tired. Eventually she got fired for sleeping on the job but I wonder if the money she lost in the time between losing the job to finding a new job was more or less than what the upkeep of a car would be. Really interesting stuff.\s\sAlso interesting is the history of solutions it seems like every other year there's a new be all and end all to carbon emissions from nuclear power plants to planting trees to electric cars to Sodastream to protests to carbon taxes. We tried a carbon tax over here but it was out of touch with the average Australian. Power companies just raised the prices by the same % they were getting charged because it would've been more expensive to invest in clean energy than to just charge the consumer. In the end we ended up voting in Tony Abbott which he was a good laugh. Before you go and Google and try to cancel him remember you weren't there and you're probably not an Australian we're chill you guys scare us at how bipolar you guys are about your politics. I read somewhere that even if we do everything we're supposed to with carbon emissions it still just won't work because we simply have to many living creatures on earth and the only solution is to cut the population in half. This could be done via a one child rules given it'd effectively half the population but I mean that's a bit authoritative. Mostly it seems to come from China but China is this weird catch 22 between consumers businesses suppliers and government that we're all locked into. It was interesting to see trump try and stand up but I think even he realised that China is too deeply engraved in how we commerce to be swapped by anybody. \s\sBut I mean I don't really think the average person should really care about stuff like this. I'm sure it'll all be sorted out by people who are far smarter than I am in positions much higher than me or anyone I know. I mean I don't really know who to vote for because I'm not sure who's right but I'm sure the people who are voting know what they're talking about and they'll get it right. At the end of the day we just have to roll with the punches and instead of spending time complaing about how shit the world is we should be spending time doing things we find value in like fishing. Boy do I love fishing.\s\sP.S. interesting thing I'm hearing more often is that people have ""saviour complexes"" it's interesting because most people who complain about issues in the world aren't the ones who are being directly impacted instead they feel like they are saving someone else who is being directly impacted. I wonder if people enjoy doing that or look back on that time spent and see it as time used to the fullest. I don't know I'm sure psychology students will have a better idea of what people are doing on Reddit and Twitter 20 years from now. Until then we can just have a geez and get back to it.\s\sI know many people won't read this (if any) because no one sorts comments by new or in fact read beyond the first couple of lines. I find tl;dr's fantastic because I don't want to waste my time reading something which I kind of get the vibe won't be worth my time but if you are reading this then you aren't the target audience. I've realised this a lot but I think people comment not for others but for themselves to reaffirm their beliefs and get it in writing get it straight I guess. I mean if you're scrolling through Twitter or Reddit and someone says ""X"" sucks or we need to abolish ""X"" or even we need to protect ""X"" ask them 'are you telling yourself that or are you telling others that'. Of course they'll probably attack you because you 'oppose' Thier opinion but when they think back on it the person who got the most value out of their comment was themselves. Rarely do I see people change their beliefs and why should they they're beliefs. But at the end of the day I think if someone believes in ""x"" and someone doesn't believe in ""X"" the difference shouldn't even be noticed because these beliefs are part of a group but when you talk to someone they're not a group they're a unique person a greatest hits of influences and experiences and it's something we should cherish about each other rather than drown it out by lumping them into groups. That why I like shows like all gas no brakes because I might not agree with them but you see a raw person and I respect that.\s\sMoral of the story go fishing it's great. Unless you're a vegetarian then just do fishing but forget about the catching bit because it's the moment surrounding that catch that makes that experience truly meaningful and valuable.The local conservative think tank glory hole radio station was complaining about gas prices and blaming Biden on the 21st. \s\sThere’s a reason nobody under 60 listens to the station other than for the sports broadcasts.Conservatives are dumbI've never understood this about Americans. Your gas is cheap as fuck (yes it is stop whining) yet you drive the most gas guzzling hunks of metal and cry tyranny when gas prices increase 5%.\s\sCan't afford gas at $3/gallon? Then trade in your Ford F450 pickup truck that you never pick anything up with for a fucking sedan and see your gas cost cut in half.If she's paying $3/gal in TN she's buying Premium. Regular hasn't been above $3 anywhere in the state for years. Probably going on a decade.""I paid for gas for the first time in my life.

You obviously haven't been in india. 90 rs/ 1.35 USD per litre. And 50% of that goes to tax.So she filled up a separate container?I cant hear this because i’m in my living room rn with my parents.... but LMAOOOOOOOOwhat do you think she is doing in the middle of a pandemic that is making her pay so much for gas?Why do American cars have such shitty mpg? I'm from the UK and my VW Polo used to do 65-70mpg.How did this guy go through all this trouble to estimate her tank size while the gallon amount is shown right below the price???This was also filmed in Tennessee where gas is close to $2 a gallon in most areasAll those words you said she will not hear them because....BIDEN!I'm her defense she's an idiot.From Texas gas here is 1.953USD is high?\s\sI calculated the cost here in USD gallons 672USD for a gallon. 15NOK for one liter which is the average price I think.3$/3.78 liters is good. Less than a dollar per liter.Gas prices in my town have went up 18% since Biden has been in office.Ha! I’m not a fan of either guy but I am a fan of logic.She probably didn’t even voteHer car does guzzle gas but Biden literally stopped the work of a pipeline his first day in office which made gas prices rise everywhere in the US... You can agree or disagree with his decision but he irrefutably made gas prices rise at least some. Also 3 dollar gas is hardly unprecedented dudeI love these new trend of calling out dumb white bitches with facts and informations3$ a gallon is craze cheap for western european standardsIn the Netherlands i would have to pay 6.87USD for a gallon. Stop crying please.Jesus Christ nobody got this heated over the “Thanks Obama” memePeople are idiots.  Gas prices are determined by far more dynamic factors than a blue or red White House. This narrative is old and lazy.It reminds me about how people was acting in 2008 after Obama got elected. I was working in a call center for a healthcare company. Some of the people calling in was blaming Obama for their issues weeks after he won the election. The inauguration wasn’t until Jan 20 2009 but people were blaming Obama for stuff in late Nov & throughout Dec before he was actually sworn in.All things considered Biden is doing an ok-ish job so far[deleted]She really thought she did something thereWhile I do believe that the Biden administration will cause gas prices to go up from eliminating fracking and pushing green New deal I do think her video is retarded and makes no sense.\s\sEven without the pointless investigation of the vehicle she's driving all you have to do is divide the two numbers to see that the gas price is $2.59. That's still quite low.I can almost guarantee this fool doesn't vote and she's filling up her moms car with dads money.I had someone tell me about how Trump lowered gas prices.  I tried explaining that the dip in gas prices was because people were traveling less do the the lockdowns for Covid but they didn't believe me.Someone driving a 2006 Nissan Pathfinder totally got that Trump tax cut thoughThis isn’t just a problem in America. I’m not American and gas prices are rising where I live. So quit your bullshit this is happening all around the world.Gas price gone up because the investors anticipated economy will recover and demand for gas will increase. Which is a result of Biden's presidency. Yeah his fault.I remember in 2007-08 the gas prices in the San Diego area were close to $4.50-5.00. My 20 gallon 90's toyota truck would be brutal to fill up each week.I never understood why people think the president sets the price of crude oil.Don't yell at her how are conservatives suppose to keep relevant if they don't actively bitch about literally everything in the universe?I mean Biden shut down the keystone pipeline which made gas prices hike no?Well he did stop the keystone pipeline which cost an estimated 20k jobs. I think the biggest thing that happened was travel increased during the pandemic while production remained scaled back.\s\sWe had so much oil at the start of the pandemic that people had to store it away and tried to export as much as possible as they scaled back production.\s\sThey’re also working on making gas car production a thing of the past by 2035. If I was an oil company I would spike my prices and get ahead of the game by using that money and my huge brand recognition to pave the way for electric vehicles and batteries.\s\sGiven the green policies the Biden administration is pursuing and the damage it will cause the oil industry I would argue he has and continues to do things that will drive up gas prices for the next decade or so.[deleted]bruh his pipeline EO was on day fucking 2. That alone cause a pretty obvious spike in prices. Agree with it or not I'm not here to debate the politics but calling out the ignorance of this dude for not knowing something that he specifically called out.both of them are cringe. But I actually give benefit of the doubt to the girl probably make sort of ""thanks Obama""-esque joke.\s\sBut the other dude is just a joke.Shoot I like this guy. The girl is cringe not he.I mean he was showing 22 and 23 gallons which at 3 dollars a gallon is 69 dollars so I’m confused on how she is lying. He just can’t do math. It literally shows she got 23.something gallons. He just doesn’t know his gas works.\s\sEdit:  I wasn’t commenting about the political situation I was just pointing out the math was true. And even if she got 100 miles to the gallon a 24 gallon tank would cost 72 dollars at 3 dollars per gallon. If he was making some other point he might of left out the size of the tank.He's not saying she's wrong. His math was to demonstrate the fuel economy of her car sucks.Yeah his math was completely unnecessary but she's still lying/wrong about Biden being responsibleHe shutdown the Keystone Pipeline along with signing over 30 BS executive orders in the first few days. Not only did he reverse our ensured energy independence but he removed jobs stemming to over 1 million job losses. You live in a Chinese funded echo chamber and their United States diplomats are Creepy Joe and Whacky HarrisKeystone xl was predicted to create 11000 jobs mostly in Canada. One million?? Come on lolOh I see the Keystone Pipeline that was years away from completion increased gas prices within two weeks of its cancellation. That makes perfect sense. You guys should totally vote for Trump on 2024 and get back to sucking that fascist dictatorship tittyEnergy independence from Canadian Oil? How is that independence? Trump lost 3 million jobs during his time in office most of it was exported to China by orders of Trumps Masters President Xi and Putin and Republican CEOs to help bump up their stock price by 25 cents talk about echo chambers...A million jobs? 😂Gas prices are [up $0.042](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/index.php) from a year ago.We nearly produce enough petroleum to have energy independence(within 6-7%). But we export like 40% of it.>Dude Biden cancelling Keystone for four years is fine!

The overriding factor that determines the price of oil from day to day is the market principle of supply and demand [source: U.S. Energy Information Administration]. It comes down to simple economics: When demand is greater than supply prices rise.\s\sThe actual price of a barrel of oil is constantly changing since oil is a commodity that is traded on the futures market. Buying and selling oil futures is called speculating because you're making trades based on expectations of future supply and demand.Probably not popular here.\s\s&nbsp;\s\sCompared to the rest of the gas prices in the world US gas prices are still ridiculous low.\s\s&nbsp;\s\sQuit whining like little bitches own your own shit about time you start paying for the CO2 pollution you cause.

China > India > USHow does comparing prices between 2 countries make it bad for people to complain? Gas prices have gone up almost 50 cents since January. Who cares what the prices are elsewhere I have a right to complain about it lmfaoTo present date America has put out twice as much carbon as China and continues to put out about three times as much per capita.> Stop whining its pathetic.\s\sIt's a specific group of people whining about this.

Why is this a thing?Gas prices always go down in the winter because it's a different blend.

A crashing dollar thanks to stimulus/fed policies and 2.

So I guess it’s the same energy as that.Does trump not have a nose?From March 23rd 2020 to election day the national average gas price didn't go above 2.11/gallon.

It's still cheaper than most other places in the world.  In my area it went up around $.30/gal.  Not really a huge jump but it will probably continue to creep up and the cost of all other products will go up as well.  I bet my parents will regret buying their giant SUV!pipeline cuts tooBiden army out with pitchforks to defend him.In Romania we pay almost 6 fucking dollars for a gallon and we make in a day as much as an American makes in an hour but they're still the one's to complain jesus fucking christ\s\sEdit: the minimum wage here is \~256 EUR after taxes so that means that we make \~12.8 EUR or \~15.51 USD **a day**.This boy is so pressed over a random tiktok lmfaoGas prices and food prices are going up hopefully the new administration will address it.

They’re all talking about gas prices spiking up and it’s all Biden’s faultIt isEverytime a Democrat is in office we get high gas prices.I live in Canada and pre pandemic I frequently paid up to 1.65/litre (for premium mind you) which works out to about 6.25/gallon (CAD) with today's exchange rate that's about 4.92 USD/ gallon. I drove about 130 km/ day. My gas bills were stupid expensive. Sooooo this is a drop in the bucket in my eyes. I have no empathy.Where the hell do you live that gas was that expensive? Vancouver? If I was paying $1.40/litre then gas was expensive. Also that new bs carbon tax has got to be doing a number on you then. The cost of gas on my end went up like $5-8 per fill and I’m not even paying $1.65/litreWhat is that song2 phut hon- kaiz remixWhich song is this[Pháo - 2 Phút Hơn \(KAIZ Remix\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw7Y0jQ8_BU)I'm from Europe and was in San Francisco and a guy drove us to Napa Valley to try some wine.

Anyone can buy a .com a .org or any other type of domain name except for a .gov so you can’t just see any random website and assume it’s legit yet many people do.  \s   \sYou also gotta pay attention to how well crafted the site is does it have SSL protection is it just a lazily re-skinned Wordpress site?? Google may hate promoting unsecured sites but it still will promote them from time to time regardless of they have an SSL or any sort of security measures. Not to mention that majority of the time it’s unsecured and lazily built Wordpress sites that people are just writing insane bullshit that these “I do my own research” idiots are getting their info from. If someone is too lazy to buy a domain name or to get security on their site or to get a custom coded site instead of just using the default web builder tools then that is probably not a reliable source of information as it could quite literally be any random ass person running that site.   \s  \sNow of course there are people that know how to craft a good looking website on the surface and make it seem legit but these fuckers don’t take the extra step to check out who is running the site?

He’s a lost cause and the definition of a deplorable at this point.Literally getting people killed with misinformation.Love this comment. I agree it’s disheartening and i can’t help but empathize.Will Cain is a asshole through and through. He got tired of having his ass handed to him everyday on ESPN so he ran over to Fox News.I remember visiting my parents in late 2019 and they had fox news on and were actively engaged in watching it. I had never actually seen it before and I swear I thought they were watching an SNL skit at first until it kept going and going and then I realized it wasn’t supposed to be satire…\s\sI now know my parents watch Fox religiously and actually believe this crap and it just makes me really sad because they are well educated people who work hard for a living and (I thought) taught me the ethics I have today. I feel like I should have realized they were drinking the koolaid sooner and maybe I could have done something but they are so far down the rabbit hole any fact checking/correcting on my end results in a huge argument where they might as well be sticking their thumbs in their ears and saying “I’m not listening!” I wonder if they have always been this way but I somehow didn’t realize when I was a kid.\s\sMy mom called me bawling when Biden won because of the pandemonium Fox news promised would happen. She told me the attack on the Capitol was done by extreme leftists pretending to be Trump supporters to make them look bad. \s\sIt just makes me really sad like the parents I thought I had didn’t exist./r/HermanCainAward at it's finestFuck Fox NewsUsed to work in a government agency in DC where I frequently interacted with congressionally elected people and sadly Fox News was the only channel that was ever on in their offices.Just watched [this](https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/fox-and-the-big-lie:-how-the-network-promoted/13510238?jwsource=cl) on ABC Australia called “Fox and the Big Lie: How the network promoted Donald Trump’s propaganda and helped destabilise democracy in America.”  They are truly the trinity of Satan. Watch it it’s fascinating.*Faux NewsFox News shouldn't even be legal.  It is a dangerous misinformation machine.  But banning it would just give the watchers even more of a persecution complex...They’re very good at what they do. Get you emotionally riled up and then when your emotions are running your brain throw out their incorrect view and now you accept it without parsing because being emotional really stunts your ability to dissect an argument.\s\sI was a Fox News fan and frankly am disgusted with that version of me. I’m just lucky that cognitive dissonance forced me to reconsider whether my views were actually backed up by data or whether there were other explanations that were better supported / more logical.Amen.\s\s#Fuck Fox 'News'Is fox 4 like fox news too?Yeah I perfer NewsmaxI appreciate this lady so much as someone with parents who are super anti mask I'll make sure to show them this video next time they go on about their conspiracies.\s\s\sSeriously fuck people who spread misinformation. Especially when it is embarrassingly wrongIt won't change anything. They'll just say that research was fixed that she's lying that the research isn't accurate that she's heard it both ways. At this point if you're anti-mask it's not about being mislead about science.Why do these fox talking heads always FUCKING YELL?!    \sITS OBNOXIOUS. SEE THIS? WRITING ALL CAPS? IS IT ANNOYING YET?\s\s&#x200B;\s\sjeeezTarget audience has a bad hearing.It's because mouth breathers are too lazy to listen yelling is the que to start listening to the ""important"" stuff. \s\sIt's why the people who watch Fox don't like BBC or NPR; because you actually have to listen.People talk loud when they want to act smart.If they yell you’re less likely to listen critically and more likely to listen emotionallyI feel this lady big time.  Especially the end part.Not cringe.is that Will Cain?Oh my god you’re right. Looks like he found an appropriate home outside ESPN.Bruh I thought I recognized that pompous ass voice from somewhere! I fucking hated this dude the day he made his first appearance on First Take.Why would someone who's a science denier care about whether there is a peer reviewed study?Because there's incredible levels of cognitive dissonance going on here. They want the science when it ""supports"" their viewpoint but otherwise science is wrong.\s\sIt's like people denying covid up until they have a really bad case of it and then taking up space in the hospital. They don't want to trust the medical system until shit goes down for them. It's incredibly selfish.Why do people make videos in their cars? It’s not a judgement but I’m not sure where it started or why!Probably because they don't have somewhere in their home they can record in private.  I am sure some would feel embarrassed if the roommates or family over heard them making social media content.  The person in front of the camera might be a lot different than the person they've known prompting the ""why are you acting weird"" type questions.I guess because it's a quiet well lit private space (depending on where you are parked obviously).And with a coffee mug that doesn’t fit in the cup holder?! \sNo judgement here either I just don’t understand \sI tried it once and spilt coffee all through my carHow do you all not realize the bigger problem here? Fake news exists to further tear people apart and divide people who love fox news will naturally hate people who are fans of other news channels and vice versa. Wake up.God this is a stupid fucking take. As if for a second it makes fox news less culpable. Just ............. this is as a shit take as most fox pundits have honestly.  \s\s\sLike ""NEVERMIND YALL THIS COMMENTOR SAYS FOX IS AOK"".....\s\s![gif](giphy|8b9Xax6L7qtAkAimGm|downsized)Fox News makes me want to commit violence against them. I don't enjoy feeling this way but that's how maddening these cunts are. Spreading dangerous bullshit like this should be a crime I don't give a fuck if it's news or just 'entertainment'. They should be prosecuted and the network shut down.Seek help.Fox entertainment should have it's license pulled and be removed from on-air. \s\sThey're murdering people.\s\sRemember when the government didn't allow cussing or any sexual innuendo on television? If you're going to tell me the government can't do something about a ""channel"" that's causing people to kill themselves and others then I'm going to call 'bullshit"".Always hated this turd even when he was on ESPN. Such a shit eaterI didn’t realize he ended up at Fox News.  Pretty fitting.I had to double take like is this the guy I use to see pop on on First Take that rubbed me the wrong way every time he came on?\s\s…..fitting I guessWhat possible gain will they derive by putting out his fake news. Genuinely trying to understand how increasing covid / deaths of their own country benefits an American news channel or its owners![gif](giphy|LdOyjZ7io5Msw)All I know is that my surgeon and all the nurses that are in the operating room wear masks and that my insurance pays for this.  Everyone knows how just how uppity insurance companies are they would not pay for anything that is not a “medically necessity” are anything that does not work.Can we sue Fox News for misleading practices?  Like they should at least need a disclaimer that their “news” is just their opinion and not actual news.[deleted]Also she misquotes the news anchor who clearly stated that randomized clinical trials are the gold standard as having said that JAMA is the gold standard. She then highlights several studies that are not randomized clinical trials as meeting that gold standard.\s\sI agree with her main conclusions that masks have been studied and found to work and that Fox News lies about science but wow does she bumble her way over that finish line.Yeah that is true. Just above that it states the real fact that across the whole group only 5% of the 2300 experienced influenza.\s\sSo it's actually even better? 🤔I'm a sub at r/Boston and you wouldn't even believe the amount of anti-mask information there. I realized only watching after this video that one of the talking points was straight outta Fox News (i.e. ""RCT don't say masks are effective"")I'm a dom in South Africa :)most posts there are pro masks except for the controversial or down voted comments.[deleted]UghWhy is mask such an issue? The worst that it can do is slight inconvenience.Imagine people afraid of their own shadow being also disgusted by their own breath. Shocking.Fox ""news""How can you call any other news company fake when fox news doesn't even cover foxes????Question though: why is Fox News lying to their audience?If it's on TV its entertainment not news.""I hate it here"" at the end. As a European I do sympathise“The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves and wiser people so full of doubts.”  Bertrand RussellHonestly a great argument to use KN-95s. I'd bet most of that difference (if it actually exists considering the overlapping CIs) comes down to mask fit and not the actual filtering efficiency.\s\sEdit: spellingThe people on /r/conspiracy see this type of news report and go apeshit about how they are being controlled lolno they dont.  theyd call fox news fake news tooThe politics in this country are fake. I’m sure fox knows they just dont care. If you keep your citizens at each others throats they will never rationally talk about the real problems. Like climate change or how our government isnt even democratic it’s an oligarchy. Politics are just as much of a farce as this fox news bs. The democrats just sound more appealing. The people have 0 power in this country.\s\sDivide and conquer baby.I don't understand Fox News. Is it a fake news network? If it's that... Why does it exist?? spreading lies for the fun of it under a literal news name I don't understand. I remember my mom telling me some crazy thing. I asked her where she got it from and she said Fox News. 🤔I think it's in a documentary called ""Outfoxed"". Rupert Murdoch was taken to court and testified that Fox News was not a news network but an entertainment network so they basically had no obligation to tell the truth.I believe they had to make some legal changes in the mid-2000s to reclassify as an entertainment program so people would stop suing them for all the lies they tell.They argue in court that: no reasonable person would ever believe what they say.\s\sAs to why?  Ask Credlo Dolla or any other mega church pastor.“I hate it here” new ringtoneAgree she is hella cringe.fox news is faux news. the oppertunity for the title was RIGHT THERE! WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO GREATNESS!I love this and herShe is one annoying cunt.Jess is doing some awesome videos.Fox News is the gold standard of bullshitWhat is this thing where people react to stuff and try to appear casually drinking from a cupI want her on the news and in congress or atleast more people like her.This woman is the walmart version of AOCI don't understand why these people aren't facing criminal charges. Even if you honestly believe this to be true it objectively isn't and therefore you are committing negligent homicide.\s\sThere is no defense. It would be like if Jim Jones was on trial for letting all those people drink poison Kool aid and his defense was the he doesn't personally believe that poison can harm you.\s\sI mean good for you but it fucking does so now you're a mass murderer.They do have a defence - They aren't a news network... they are an entertainment network. \s\sThey have literally used this defence a number of times. \s\sI personally don't buy it - but its the slimy shit they will pull to weasel out of any responsibility for what they say.TikTokCringe is intended to be a fun and entertaining subreddit.

A N95 with a 3mm gap is only 3% effective. In a recent study it was found that cloth masks are only 10% effective at filtering particles the size of the COVID virus.\s\shttps://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100Per CDC data from last March thru Dec. Mask mandates lowered death and cases by less than 2%.Because viruses just float around in the air by themselves huh? Silly me I thought they tended to hitch rides on body fluids like saliva.\s\sTry citing something relevant that takes into account how communicable diseases work. Have you read the multiple *epidemiological* studies that have found masks provide effective source control? Do you need help finding those?I dont care enough to verify that but even if it is true 10% is better than 0%. It's a piece of cloth. Nothing more.The fucking companies that make the masks tell you flat out that they don't stop airborne viruses. It's even on the box of many brands. How is this still debated?They say that for liability claims. That way nobody can sue them if they get sick. I would do the same if I owned a mask company.https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118Theyre all fake news this includes fox as wellI agree with her but her tone is so condescending.

I thought I was on popular when this popped into my feedBlame people who politicized mask-wearing this was not an issue until the pandemic started and people felt their “freedoms” were infringed upon because they were asked to wear a mask to stop the spread of a disease. \s\sIf you take a dumb position don’t expect to not be clowned on wherever you go.If the virus wasn’t politicized and performing your basic public health duties wasn’t made into a battleground of partisan opinions then we wouldn’t be here. We are here though and FOX and others chose to make this left vs right and angry feel facts vs science.

Now tell me about how effective vaccines are and why I need to wear a mask even if I’m vaccinated.You can still get covid and pass it on without symptoms even if you have been vaccinated. The vaccination gives you protection against it so it's less likely you'll get it and if you did it would be a lot less severe but you can still pass it on to vulnerable people. So it's better for everyone to wear a mask regardless until levels of transmission are lowerHahah this lady is nuts. She misquoted the dude and can not even read the study that she presented.This condensing cunt has no clue what she's talking about. Influenza is not Cov19.  She's comparing apples to oranges and is SOOO full of herself for being completely wrong.\s\sCov19 is carried by aerosol.  None of the masks held on with rubber bands are effective at keeping in or holding out aerosol. \s\sYou need a sealed face mask and eye protection not to mention impeccable hygiene. Wear a surgical mask if it make you feel good but that's all it's doing for you or anyone else.People still die in car crashes wearing seatbelts so why wear seatbelts?\s\sPeople still commit crimes with laws in place so why have laws?\s\sSee how stupid that logic is? There's a reason it's a logical fallacy. Of fucking course it doesn't totally prevent it. But she literally showed you tons of sources that masks are really good at reducing transmission. Why do you think masks have been a thing for the last hundred years?\s\sAll the people bitching about masks haven't said a goddamn thing about them till now. They didn't just appear in 2020.Source?Bruh. She cited her sources now you cite yours.well at least youre calling the fox news broadcaster a liar i guess thats somethingExcept in all of these studies the mask are clean and worn properly people in the real world do not do this kids do not do this and this disease is not as deadly as people try to make it.See masks are made to wear for limited times and yes in those limited times they can provide protection.Not to be worn every time you leave the house whether you are sick or not.couldn't they just get new masks?The reason doctors change masks is easy to find.\s\sIt's because of bacterial contamination.  Not reduced effectiveness to prevent viral spread.\s\sThe mask gets bacteria growing in it that can infect a patient.\s\sDon't be so stupid.Old people on tiktok is so weird.Can she hold her mug like a nornal person please?Easier to see its an RBG mug that way.Chin bigger than my dreams!Thought she’s a dude at first ngl[deleted]tiktokcringe isn't just a cringe some anymore. look at the tagsThey called the RCT gold standard no?

They work they definitely work doctors wouldn't wear PPE if it didn't work. Why are people still debating it? They're a thin piece of fabric in front of your face they're a minor inconvenience. The worst it does is make your face slightly warmer. Who is so sensitive that they can't even handle wearing a cloth mask for 30-60 minutes during their shopping? I get that they're not flattering or they can be slightly annoying but I'll tell you what is more annoying - covid.Honestly someone should pull FOX NEWS’ broadcast license.I’m a conservative but good lord I hate Fox News.  Used to like will Cain(the broadcaster) on ESPN too a shame he’s doing this crapSooo…..people are still watching the news? I don’t know many people that believe in Fox News or any MSM for that matterOkay so you’ve determined masks work. And according to these studies - quite effectively. \s\sI’ll just gently remind you that the genius science community has *never* before 2020 recommended the use of masks to combat cold and flu season. They never knew about that or they never tried it or they knew and never publicly shouted that from the rooftops. \s\sThat’s not strange to you?\s\sThe geniuses went straight to choosing one particular flu variant and injecting the general public with that one. Which may or may not have been the right one. \s\sBut a mask would have helped a great deal and wouldn’t have discriminated against the variant. \s\sIt’s a real thinker!Uhh the 1919 flu pandemic.\s\sMasks required by law.\s\sBird flu throughout the last decades: people in Asia masked up.\s\sYou are fucking stupid.  We have been masking for hundreds of years.  Dumb fuck.\s\shttps://www.google.com/amp/s/healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/mask-resistance-during-a-pandemic-isnt-new-1918-many-americans-were-slackers%3famp>I’ll just gently remind you that the genius science community has never before 2020 recommended the use of masks to combat cold and flu season.\s\sAt minimum we have been taught to cover our mouths before we cough and nose before we sneeze. Either way it's more a cultural thing that we don't wear masks regularly. Go to a country like Japan and they wear masks pretty regularly when they get colds and the flu.Have you never been to a doctors office or hospital during flu season? There are usually signs and guidance to wear masks (usually with disposable masks provided) if you have any flu symptoms. Also public health guidance has always had mask wearing in addition to staying home hand washing vaccination as recommended mitigation strategies during flu seasons.  \s\sAlso FYI it's usually several variants that go into the flu vaccine every year. You're right at it's a bit of a guess but they use information from variants from the flu season on the other hemisphere with an opposite flu season to the US to figure out what is likely to be a problem here. Sometimes it's really good but sometimes they miss the mark. Even when the vaccine isn't great at preventing illness it does reduce disease severity and amount of viral shedding (and transmission).This woman has NO idea What she's talking about we shouldn't have a mask mandate!\s\sWe should have a vaccine mandate :)It's very possible she has no expertise in masks  but that's the beauty of using the 'gold standard' of medical evidence. The reporting of fox news in this instance is the definition of fake news but could be all down to being too stupid to read a study correctly rather than being dishonest.[deleted]for proving fox news lied about an article they sourced?This woman sucks.\s\sI mean fuck antimaskers but she is the worstwhy?Masks are useless \s\sList of 30 studies showing face masks are useless against COVID-19\s\shttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257385v1.full-text\s\shttps://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/\s\shttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/\s\shttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32590322/\s\shttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/\s\shttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26579222/\s\shttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/\s\shttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/\s\shttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1\s\shttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2\s\shttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372\s\shttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214\s\shttps://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567\s\shttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779801/\s\shttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/\s\shttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/\s\shttps://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747\s\shttps://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bio/23/2/23_61/_pdf/-char/en\s\shttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736\s\shttps://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/0195-6701(91)90148-2/pdf90148-2/pdf)\s\shttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493952/pdf/annrcse01509-0009.pdf\s\shttps://web.archive.org/web/20200717141836/https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data\s\shttps://www.nap.edu/catalog/25776/rapid-expert-consultation-on-the-effectiveness-of-fabric-masks-for-the-covid-19-pandemic-april-8-2020\s\shttps://www.nap.edu/read/25776/chapter/1#6\s\shttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article\s\shttps://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/54/7/789/202744\s\shttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599448/\s\shttps://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1342\s\shttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00392-020-01704-y\s\shttps://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jide/journal-of-infectious-diseases-and-epidemiology-jide-6-130.php?jid=jide\s\shttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1130147308702355Lmao you literally linked the article she was talking about proving you wrongDo you even understand what you're linking here?

A hospital shouldn’t have to turn away its most critically ill because of those ignorant enough to forego the vaccine.You could hear the impact his finger made when ending the recording. Mans straight up punched that display. I feel him.I felt that too seeing this guys video. You can just feel how frustrated and just scared for his wife really and all he can do is make a video about it. Kinda like he just had to get his anger out and this was the least destructive and most real way he could do anything. \s\sDefinitely feel for the guy. This entire situation is out of control.When my wife was dealing with her breast cancer I got to drain her Jackson-Pratt tubes and remove them. Most of her post operational care not counting major checkups was done at home over zoom because it was safer than being in the hospital. Anything hands on I got to do... So yeah. I'm with this guy.Amen to that. The Hippocratic oath could really really use an anti-vax amendment.I am just growing zero tolerance for these kinds of hyper individualistic people who go and live in their own fantasy world only to ruin everybody else's reality and also end up being carried and saved by the very things they froth at.I feel like a lot of hospital workers feel the exact same way.This is why my wife's mom died last year.  She had a stroke but the hospitals were so overrun she didn't get any care until something like 13 hours after.  She laid on a bed in a hallway at the hospital alone.Tbh vaccinated people and people that are unable to get vaccinated for LEGITIMATE reasons should be able to call dibs on hospital beds and ventilators. I’m vaccinated but both of my children are too young to get the vaccine. So if one of my kids gets sick enough to need a hospital bed then a non-vaxxed patient should get booted. I’d volunteer to be the one that wheels them into the parking lot. I’d gladly remind them that they did their rEsEaRcH so they should be just fine handling their own medical care. They’re smarter than all the scientists and doctors anyway right?This happened to my mom with stage 4 lung cancer. She appointments and surgeries kept getting pushed and pushed. She was diagnosed last July and passed in Dec. She had one treatment before she was put on hospice.Forreal though! I’m just another chronically ill person and knowing how many people don’t care about being vaccinated etc…hurts.\s\s‘Vaccines are gonna kill you all hurr hurr’\s\sSo? Stop running to the hospital!Meanwhile weakling right-wing grifter Joe Rogan will never cover this guy and keep sowing doubt about the vaccines to a huge audience.\s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lV6A-ViMQ8They need to give priority to somebody else that is more likely to survive. If that person happens to be an anti-vaxer that got sick I’m not sure how they can prioritize things.Sooner or later someone is going to lose a loved one because of the antivaxxers.It’s already happening. The blood of everyone who is unable to get vaccinated who has been sick with and died of covid is on the hands of the willingly unvaccinated.Sooner or later?

And if you haven’t figured out that this kind of misinformation is causing tangible harm then you can at least just shut up and stop pretending you have any backing to your position.Did you even read what your article said? It doesn’t link people in the hospital based on vaccination status. It sure does show that way fewer vaccinated people are getting sick though and very few of them are in the hospital. Congrats on posting a counterpoint to your own argument.no. 3% of hospitalizations cause by severe symptoms are vaccinated people (likely with pre-existing conditions the data isn’t that granular) the other 97% are unvaccinated idiots.Here are the numbers for the province of Ontario Canada (which currently sits at 73% eligible pop fully vaccinated):\s\s> 6.42 cases per 100000 unvaccinated.\s> \s> 4.54 cases per 100000 partially vaccinated\s> \s> 0.83 cases per 100000 fully vaccinated.\s>\s> 87% reduction in cases fully vaccinated vs not.\s\s(Numbers calculated from data available at https://covid-19.ontario.ca/ )Been vaccinated or paid some dude off craigslist for a fake vaccination card?\s\sBecause I'm betting they aren't going to confess to a crime( Title 18 United States Code Section 1017- unauthorized use of a government seal) just because they get the big sick.\s\sWhat did that tv show doctor always say? People always lie.Just because this headline+your comment can be a little confusing I feel I need to add that 2232 is the number of new positive COVID cases in vaccinated individuals not hospitalizations. The report looks at numbers for the previous week and there are almost 10000 new cases with 445 hospitalizations of vaccinated individualsMaybe if your unvaxxed body wasn't a swampy cesspool for breeding new variants the efficacy of the vaccine wouldn't be threatened.The guy in the video didn’t even say 100 percent lmao strawman shitThis message clearly isn't meant for themTruth bomb!!! 🤙🙏🙏Yessss absolutely true!Amazing sad but so amazingWhen he said keep ur guns I thought he about to tell them to shoot themselves if they can't handle the symptoms tbh.""BeCaUsE tHaT's ReAl MeDiCiNe NoT vAcCiNeS VaCcInEs ArE fAkE mEdIcInE.""\s\sYes people actually believe this kind of BS.

Their Lord and Savior will lay hands on them.Good idea. It's big enough. Let the Trumps help be responsible for what they have wrought.Not cringe. Hard truth.I’d love to be out in an outside tent treated by unvaccinated staff. All those that are leaving because of mandated vaccines in the hospital who already have shortages can instead treat the unvaccinated.What could go wrong? LOLWe have family that are saying they don't want the vaccine because it's against their religion. Then when my husband and I got it they actually became angry that we all self isolated and forbid anyone to come to the house... Yeah you read right... I said they became mad. According to them if you are ment to get it you will get it it is the will of God.\s So his one daughter is a school teacher you telling me it's ok for her to get it then go give it to her students? How is that God's will?\sHow do you stand up and say bullsh*t like that when you could literally be killing people? How do you in your right mind say it's God's will for you to get away with being a di*k? (Or worse a murderer)How? Easy? The mind will always rationalize everything in order to preserve its own self-image. If they acknowledge that you taking responsibility for your actions by self isolating is a good thing then that would mean that the idea of ""everything is in god's hands"" is no longer valid. So your actions were a direct threat to their world view. A view where they reject any personal sense of responsibility. So they either take it out on you or admit that maybe they're wrong. It has to be one or the other.[removed]Hey goofball[!](https://imgur.com/a/XTuSUNR) Looks like you missed the pinned comment!

Reading a third of it and everything you've said is wrong. You're an absolute clown that went through a lot of effort to post misinformation. Don't go to the hospital when you get sick. 🤡And the firefighters!\s\sWhere do they go when they get hurt saving your house from burning down?\s\sEdit: Is this group seriously voting me down because I'm concerned that there's not enough hospital spaces for firefighters if they get injured in the line of work. What the fuck is wrong with you people?The firefighters aren't the problem. When they get hurt then it's because of their job and their duty. Therefore they deserve all the medical care they need.\s\sOn the other hand people who refuse to get vaccinated had a choice and decided against the help that was offered by medical institutions. So what this man is saying is that those people shouldn't have a higher priority for getting treated than others like his wife or firefighters etc.Except the firefighters never said they were invincible and that medical attention was not required in their line of work.\s\sWhat that guy says is basically this: you either trust science or don't. If you don't trust physicians with the vaccine but trust them for curing you you're a hypocrite and people in critical need of medical care are suffering because of that hypocrisy and selfishness.Sorry dude people are idiots who don't actually read shit properly.💯💯💯💯💯I really wish the people he’s referring to would actually *hear* thisYessssTHIS! And the answer is: lack of responsibility or honorA-FUCKING-MEN!!!!Not cringe. FACTS!This poor fucking guy. The anger is definitely warranted here.where are you getting 99% from ?The current stats. [it’s really not that hard to find out](https://www.google.com/search?q=percentage%20of%20us%20hospitalisations%20vaccinated&tbm=)Well said!Disclaimer: Not saying I agree or disagree just presenting rebuttals the flair does say Discussion after all. He asked ""Why?"" and right or wrong I answered why.\s\s1. Just because some people don't get the vaccine doesn't mean they don't think it's real.\s2. If they don't think it is real then it makes sense to go to the hospital for them to find out what ""real"" sickness they have.\s3. The people who don't believe the science of the vaccine don't believe either because it is new or they think it is a conspiracy. They trust them with other things because the other viruses have been around MUCH longer. That is why they trust the doctors to cure them but not about the vaccine.\s4. Just because you think something isn't a big deal doesn't mean you completely ignore it. Do you just let your small cuts bleed?\s5. You want to just let stupid people get sick and die? Seems like you and the people you are complaining about might be on the same page about some things.\s6. Not sure why someone can't want guns and a vaccine but okay?So by this logic did they talk to their doctor about getting vaccinated? If they trust their doctors to cure them why wouldn't they trust their doctors who will tell them to get vaccinated? Seems more like they think they know better until they get sever symptoms then they'll trust the doctors.\s\sAnd your point 4 so are you saying if people think covid isn't a big deal they shouldn't ignore it and should get vaccinated? If so I agree. Everyone get vaccinated.5. Yes but at least for the unvaccinated to be put last in line.[deleted]I think you're being downvoted because you misinterpreted the term ""stick to your guns"" as literally stick to your guns. It's actual meaning is closer to ""stick with your opinion"" like if your opinion is crazy consipracy theory then stick to that narrative in every situation not just the ones that are convenient to you.\s\sBesides that your made some pretty valid points in my opinion. I think that most people forget that most of these anti-vaxx/COVID-19 denying people are usually not very educated (at least not when finding credible sources of info) and extremely ignorant. So it is entirely possible that someone who is a COVID denier could get COVID truly believe it is something else and take the symptoms as flu cold pneumonia etc. And go to hospital. That is ignorant selfish and unfair but is probably what happens. \s\sI also agree that just because someone is ignorant doesn't mean we should deny them medical care when they could easily end up in life-threatening condition. That would be like denying someone having chest pains that could lead to a heart attack because they were too ignorant to lose weight and lower cholesteral. It doesn't matter what their beliefs if their life is at risk then they should be allowed aid (I know that's not a perfect example because heart disease can't spread). \s\sHowever unvaccinated people should NOT be allowed treatment that would impede on other patients treatment such as this man and his wife with cancer. Hospitals should have a COVID wing with a set capacity vaccinated people should have priority because they are less risk to everyone and easier to treat and once that COVID wing is filled everyone else is denied.Didn’t get the vaccine. Got the virus. Stayed home and recovered just fine. Happy?\s\sEdit: why am I getting downvoted? This is literally what he’s askingforThat's literally what he was asking for.How many people did you give it to?  Exponential illness and death.Yes but countless other people aren't able to recover at home and are having to go into hospital. Something they could have avoided with the vaccineIt's different when you chose to stay home.Yes? He's specifically mad at people who didn't get the vaccine and end up at the hospital. Obviously he isn't talking about you.They will never be happy for some reason glad your ok!On the third day she rose againI want to hug this guyYeah fuck those anti vaxx POS. Poor guy. I hope his wife beats it. Fuck cancer too[deleted]Nope. They have emergency FDA approval. They also have hundreds of millions of successful real world trials. And an extremely high success rate.\s\sAny more questions?[deleted]Read the stickied mod comment. No one is saying this post is cringe. The sub moved on from having only cringe content a long time ago. The type of content can be filtered by the flairs. This post is marked as discussion rather than cringe.Well said. And positive thoughts for your wife. Hang in there!Where’s the flu ?The excess hand washing masks and social distancing honestly did the flu in for 2020. It's pretty cool honestly. It worked for the flu. That should be celebrated as a great triumph lol. \s\sThat being stated because whole the flu is not an aerosol the coronavirus is much closer to falling into that category. The flu is spread more often by droplet (sneezing coughing) contact(touch). \s\sSo the route to infection is similar but covid is more.contagious just because of that aerosol component.Amen brother!# THIS IS THE WAYAmen sirMy friend works at a hospital and she tells me these dumb fuck vaccine refusing people will go to the hospital and cry about how uncomfortable they are and refuse treatment because they don’t agree with it. WHY DID YOU GO THERE??!We don't give smokers and drinkers first in line for new organs its honestly really strange why at this stage we are treating covid like we did at the start of the pandemic.\s\sIn 2020 we were all equally victims of a terrible disease. In 2021 there's multiple vaccines of various different efficacies and costs and right now they are heavily subsidized or free essentially within most of the developed world and a good chunk of the developing world that could afford them. This is particularly egregious in the USA where not only is the vaccine fully covered by insurance you don't even need to go to a doctor to get it the burden to get a covid vaccine in the USA is two walk-in appointments to your local pharmacy every major pharmacy chain has a vaccination station and the whole process takes half an hour.\s\sIt is a willful choice now just like smoking or drinking to get covid. It is a known risk behavior. Its time to start treating them like they are engaging in an excessively risky behavior(they are) when they come into a hospital and start pushing them(covid patients) to the back of the line.Sounds like insurance companies are going to increase premiums for unvaccinated and no longer cover COVID related care.I would even argue that we weren’t all equally victims even back in 2020. My household and I wore masks religiously and abided by social distancing/lockdown guidelines. I know many who did not.>It is a willful choice now just like smoking or drinking to get covid.\s\sI wouldn't go as far as to say **getting** it is a choice - you can still get covid even if you are vaccinated especially with the Delta variant.\s\sBut the vaccine would significantly decrease your chances of getting a severe disease and getting hospitalized which is the bottom line here.This needs to be higher up for sure.I agree with this man. In fact if the hospitals are at capacity no new unvaccinated Covid patients should be admitted. Only breakthrough cases and folks who need the hospital for anything other than Covid.OathBro this is why murder shouldnt be a life sentenceIf you catch COVID and are unvaccinated in 2022 hospitals should legally have to deny these idiots. Just let their essential oils and healthy body do the work.A fucking Men brother AmenThey’ll carry a gun everywhere they go “to protect my family & the ones I love” but won’t get a vaccine or wear a mask. \s\sPhucking COVIDiots. 🤬🤬🤬🤬Based*Unvaccinated fears the vaccinated.*\s\s*Then the unvaccinated gets the virus*\s\s*Will blame on vaccinated.*This is literally happening. There are people saying vaccinated people are to blame for spread.Americans are so fucking stupid i swear. No other developed country has this problem; Germany doesn't have this problem new Zealand doesn't have this problem even england doesn't have this problem god Damn.USA has a bigger population then all the countries you listed combined of course our problems will be a lil different ya dummyContent irrelevant I like this guy. He's got the eggs and bacon poster from Parks and Rec and a giant cutout of (I assume) his baby's face around the room. \s\sI hope everything works out for his wife.Listen.  This message goes to all you fucker who eat like pigs and now suffering because their immune system can't fight off the flu. Stick to a diet. Exercise. And believe in God. Simple. Problem solved.I really thought he was going to say Die at the end!I fucking love this guy PREACH.  I hope you're wife is doing well.Great point well made.\s\sSorry for his wife's disease and dealing with it. I've lost my parents to it and I have experienced it firsthand. So I hope she does well and gets better.Yesterday there was a 26+ fucking hour wait in the ER of the hospital that I work because there are no rooms available. So many seriously ill people ended up leaving because of this.This happened to me and my wife. She had a real medical emergency had to be admitted but we had to wait 3 hours due to covid patients. They were all sitting in a see through area and al of them were relaxing. It clogged up the ER. My wife could of died and we had to wait… everyone deserves medical treatment but it just sucks we had to be low priority. Rant overAnd while your at it… you know… die. Our world is over populated anyways and we don’t need your dumbasses voting in the future.He kept it together but at the end you could tell how deeply upsetting the entire experience was for him and his wife.This poor man and his wife. Fucking depressing.\s\sIt's just like the article yesterday I read that a German nurse faked the vaccine for 9000 people because she doesnt believe it in.\s\sIf you're anti vacc...don't become a nurse. You're not going to change the system they wont tout your essential oils and reiki. Choose a different career.He ran out of fucks it seems.Those fake ass numbers tho. People vaccinated are also getting it. I see where he's coming from but the shot isn't bulletproof.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/10/us/covid-breakthrough-infections-vaccines.html\s\sNumbers aren't that far off for some states.First you can have trust in medical professionals individually but not in big pharma with a vaccine that is not actually approved yet. A vaccine that most Democrats once said they wouldn't get because they didn't like the president at the time. Low and behold the second it was there guy in office though that authoritarian boot quickly came out.\s\sSecond there are a decent number of people who actually can't get the vaccine because of other medical issue but can obviously get the bug.\s\sThird this guy wrongfully is assuming that everyone who doesn't get the vaccine believes covid is some sort of myth...that is not true some of them yes but a minority.\s\sFourth if all you crazy lefties who have this authoritarian greater good mentality really cared you'd close the fucking southern border and tell sleepy Joe to stop shipping untested/unvaccinated illegals into non-border states and releasing them into the public.It's incredible that not too far in the past this would be obviously sarcastic or satirical but nowadays I have no doubts you're serious and just as braindead as you sound.Instead of countering your bullshit with counterpoints which would fall on deaf ears any way I'm going to accept your premises and show how logically flawed they are.\s\s  \s1- Once out of medical school what process do you think facilitates medical professionals to keep up to date on new treatments and vaccines? [This highlights the dishonesty of the political nonsense you connected to it](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/23/tiktok-posts/biden-harris-doubted-trump-covid-19-vaccines-not-v/)\s\s2 - This is true for every vaccine and why aside from the personal benefit it's incredibly important for those who can get vaccinated to do so - to protect the vulnerable through herd immunity.\s\s3 - His main point relates to your first that the same confidence level you entrust to your local hospital should be equal to or greater than the national and international health organisations.\s\s4 - If true is still not an argument against any American being vaccinated and wearing masks. The one counterpoint I'll raise is this;\s\s>Coronavirus hot spots tend to be clustered far from the border or near the water whereas the entire land border area with Mexico has fairly low rates. \s\shttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/06/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-effort-blame-covid-19-spread-migrants/>  A vaccine that most Democrats once said they wouldn't get because they didn't like the president at the time.\s\sI see this frequently but nobody ever backs it up with a source.Get your meds checked.God you guys are batshit out of this world insane. Stay at home for multiple reasons oh my god.Do you realize that medical professionals individually ARE big pharma? You cannot separate the two. Big pharma finds ways to line the pockets of regular doctors who promote their drugs over alternatives. Even tho it is technically illegal for pharmaceutical companies to offer doctors kickbacks they find roundabout ways to do so\s\shttps://www.propublica.org/article/we-found-over-700-doctors-who-were-paid-more-than-a-million-dollars-by-drug-and-medical-device-companiesOk schizo take your meds.I agree with you.Working for the government I can tell you why distrust is so prevalent. When a government does everything in its power to keep things secretive while also lying to its people consistently there is a growing distrust there.\s\sI feel for you and I hope your wife beats cancer we've all got family members that have gone through it.I can’t like that enough.Sounds like you’re blaming unvaccinated people when you should be blaming the hospital for putting a lower priority on your wife 🤷🏻‍♂️ you can always go to a different hospitalI don't think you understand. They are f u l l. I just read of an infant that needed a ventilator desperately. They had to helicopter her 300 miles from home to find one.This is the dumbest point I’ve ever seen made. Arguably worse than the halfwit who supported locking unvaccinated people in jail. It seems a lot of people are forgetting or just purposely labeling anyone who is against vaccination as some sort of nut job that believes covid isn’t real. Here’s a friendly reminder that there are people with underlying health issues who would literally die after even a single dose of these vaccines. There are also people who are not allowed to vaccinate for religious reasons. This Humpty Dumpty looking idiot sounds about as smart as he looks. If you agree with him in. Any capacity there is a solid chance you are just as ignorant as him.Curious who would die from getting a vaccine?On what planet is this guy referring to people with underlying health issues or religious concerns who cannot get the vaccine??? He's talking about capable people who CHOOSE to disregard medical and public health opinion and do not get the vaccine (while many of them also refuse to wear a mask or socially distance) because they do not believe that covid is real. Or they believe non medical professionals like influencers politicians and ""news"" outlets who feed them falsehoods and half-truths. These are the people who he is referring to. These are the people who are a massive strain on the medical field due to their INTENTIONAL choices.Amen brother.I've been saying this since the start of the pandemic.... especially for those who are on their dying breath saying ""covid isn't real"" I'm sorry if it isn't real they shouldn't help you with your imaginary illness. Guess they'll have to turn you back out.I whole heartedly agree with this dude. Set some tents up outside the hospital with mombies who ""did their research."" \s\sFuck off with your shit.Texas is setting up covid tents outside. It's supposed to be 90 there this week.

"" Not true as recent numbers are coming out about even vaccinated people hospitalized and dying from covid. \sI trust the medical professionals that are in the hospitals not the makers of a baby powder that they knew caused cancer and kept making the same shit anyway.Yes genius you will hear about some vaccinated people being hospitalized and dying. What do you think the remaining 1% is?I would love to see your source on that because I’m calling bullshitIn my country the statistics show that only 5% of vaccinated ELDERLY people actually died from them virus so really that ""1%"" isn't far from reality.As an ICU nurse dealing with covid patients daily you have no idea how many times I have thought this very thought. It continually fills me with rage. My mental health is literally hanging by a few threads. I'm very sorry about your wife. That is incredibly frustrating.  I hope she continues to get the care she needs.You can’t just start refusing care just because someone is unvaccinated.  That opens up way too many other reasons for service to be able to be refused.  All the other scenarios you described the patients could just as easily be turned away by this same logic.  These insurance companies have zero morality and that’s who it would end up being who got to decide. \s\s\sdriving and looked at your phone?  Your fault no treatment.  Heart attack or stroke?  Too bad you ate too much McDonalds and other fatty food throughout your life.  Smoker?  No treatment for lung or mouth cancer for you. \s\s\sThe insurance companies already have entirely too much power in deciding what treatments they decide are necessary with no medical training they don’t need more.You missed the point of the video. No one said refusing care just pointing out how logically inconsistent it is to not trust the medical field for preventing Covid but suddenly trusting them once you have Covid.Lose weight or fuck offOh edgyPROVE ITAmenI really feel for this guy coviduots are killing others who need the medical services more than their entitled a**.I'm pissed with him and for him... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage)I just lost my mother to breast cancer. The pain they undergo is horrific. Getting their pain meds is challenging because our healthcare system is an absolute joke here in the states. Coupled with covid and these antivax morons its even worse. Exactly what he said get vaccinated or stay the fuck home and suffer your idiotic consequences. This anti-science/anti-intellectualism bullshit needs to end.If you chose not to get vaxxed and you get Covid treatment should be thoughts and prayers in a tent outside the hospital.Last week I was sharing ice cream and sniffing old perfume bottles hard with a friend that came down with covid a few days later. The person *she* caught it from was vaccinated and is in the ICU. Sure you could still get covid but I’m vaccinated and covid negative so there’s a greater chance of *not* getting it. I’ve never been so happy to be vaccinated. Go get vaccinated![A Florida antivaxxer had to have a double lung transplant](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/covid-vaccine-us-antivaxx-jab-b1896231.html) after catching covid.  FUCK THAT.  Organ transplants are such a rare gift.  My childhood best friend died of cystic fibrosis waiting for lungs to become available.  If you choose to pass on the vaccine you should lose the option of jumping ahead in line for treatments. I wonder what he thinks of all the immunosuppressive drugs he'll be prescribed now. I hope they know you can get it twice especially if you are taking suppressive drugs.I concur 100%Yes Boss!There is this former telenovela actress and Trump supporter in Mexico brainwashed by the far right telling people since last year how covid doesn't exist how government is inflating the hospital numbers and all the same crazy shit Republican people in the US always tell. Well a few days ago the woman got covid and it's now intubated in a private hospital with all the cares and it's fucking infuriating because she is probability getting attention that the majority of people do not receive due hospitals being over saturated for a goddamn virus she says ""it's just a flu""If people that are not vaccinated contract covid they should be the ones waiting 5-8 hrs in the ER waiting room I understand his pain. They should not get special treatment over everyone else because they didn't want to get the vaccine. I was bleeding out from a miscarriage a few weeks ago and the turned me away cause they had no rooms due to people coming in with covid. I couldn't get medical help and ended up loosing the baby while my kids watched in fear  cause I was in so much pain couldn't receive medical help. What they did to his wife is unacceptable I'm so sorry that they did that to your wife. I hope she is doing better!That had to be terribly traumatizing for all of you. 🌹One more thing. Half my family caught covid and they did not go to the hospital. They dealt with it because they took care of themselves. And my sister-in-law has cancer. Lupus. And diabetes and she kicked covid butt too. Maybe it's our genetic. But you should stop complaining and take your wife to a better hospital. Half you people are got to be liberals. Stop watching the news.Amen!This is fucking facts. Agree with everything he said.In france where i live if you are not vacc'ed you can't go to the hospital in the emergency ok but for appointments radiology etc etc it's denied.I wish it was that way here too. I’ve been horribly ill with a stomach problem since Saturday. I waited til Monday to call because I know how stressed and stretched medical workers are. I called for a phone consult Monday am again in the afternoon finally got a call back Tuesday to be told there’s no room at the inn. If I get any worse I’m to go to an ER and wait for treatment. I’ve had Covid twice. My doc told me almost all of his patients that got it a third time died. I got vaccinated way back but I’m not willing to go sit and be a virus sponge in an ER. I’ve been curled up in bed or in the john I’ve eaten almost nothing in 5 days kept down very few fluids and I’m in pain but I can’t get in to my clinic. Im in Texas btw. Im an old lady and have never typed this word in my life but Fuck antivaxxers and antimaskers with a steaming red hot poker.\s\sEdit: My very sweet mother in law got both jabs as early as possible but her RA meds blocked her immune response. She tried to be intelligent and responsible and is now a sitting duck.not cringeLogic doesn’t work with these people…but there should be a law passed.  If you don’t have the vaccine then the hospital should have the right not to serve you. Could you imagine how many people would get the vaccine then 😂Man if they kicked my sick wife out of the hospital to deal with unvaccinated fuckheads with COVID...I'm not sure if the guards would let me make a TikTok from prison or not but I'd get to find out. \s\sI realize that's some r/iamverybadass stuff right there but it's true nonetheless. I don't think my rage would let me NOT do something violent.C19vaxreactions.com You all are blind to people that die or have long lasting side effects from the vaccine. I’ve seen many nurses online say the same. Don’t try to kill others for your fake self righteousness. We’ll see how you are after booster 5.And have you seen the long-lasting side effects of getting Covid?  Seems more like Covidiots are killing others for their own self-righteousness....Ok schizo take your meds.At first i was like WAIT... was that a cutout of a babys head? But then i was like fuck that breakfast spread looks mighty deliciousI mean.... Seriously he's not wrong.He’s not wrong!!!That’s heartbreaking. You know he’s thinking what would happen if something more was wrong with her and the facilities were too clogged with antivaxxers for them to help. Could totally happen.Preach!!!People who are unvaccinated are :\s\sA) Completely and utterly selfish or \s\sB) Cowards who are afraid of everything they see on the internet or\s\sC) Some combination of both\s\sThese people need to be treated differently they are ruining other people's lives and it's unacceptable.Bravo 👏\s**Welcome to r/TikTokCringe!**\s\s This is a message directed to all newcomers to make you aware that r/TikTokCringe evolved long ago from only cringe-worthy content to TikToks of all kinds!

You bet your ass he's going to to the hospital if he gets covid. \s\sThe vast majority of people trust science and the medical field overwhelmingly just not this vaccine - don't be dumb fucks. \s\sYou all know if it were trump still in office and he was pushing this vaccine there'd be mass protest against it you fuckers have always been overwhelmingly anti big pharma but now all the sudden it's trendy to get the vaccine. Fuck off and fuck yourselves.This the most dumbest comment I came across Reddit today.This is such a stupid comment. \s\sDepends on how you’d define experimental. The first big roll out of this type of vaccine? Sure yeah it’s experimental. But this technology has been in development for years. \s\s\sYour boyfriend is the exception. Not the rule. \s\sNo we wouldn’t.

I’ve seen a lot of people on TikTok showing that they were vaccinated and they have covid. I’m wondering what the numbers are. Is the vaccine wearing off faster than they thought it would or like vaccinated people traveling more and being riskier? Just curiousViral load between vaccinated and unvaccinated is nearly identical.Vaccines don’t “wear off”. Sometimes you have to get a booster shot years later. Also it’s about 1 percent of people currently hospitalized are vaccinated. \s\shttps://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187The issue of people who try to prove covid isn't real is deadHe spiting facts ngl. It makes perfect senseIt’s so refreshing to hear him say it. I just watched this like 5 times. Preach!!What do you do when the healthcare workers don't vaccinate?\s\shttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/22/nyregion/staten-island-covid-vaccine-workers.htmlThis dude is spot on. Stick to your fucking guns you dark age dip shits. If it’s “basically the flu” then take some Tylenol and fuck right off back home.Its true. Its your right to decide if you want the vaccine or not but my hospital unit has had to discharge some extremely iffy would normally be in the hospital for days surgeries because all the hospital beds are taken up by covid. \s\sThe people who didnt decide to have a ruptured appendix and who didnt decide to grow a cancerous tumor..have to be kicked out of the hospital because of covid patients.\s\sFamily members faces when I have to show them how to take care of drains and tubes at home...they look at me like Im insane. Because it is insane.Its weird to think about how they don’t trust the vaccine but have their doc prescribed them drugs that they have no clue how is it made.Exactly. Antivaxers are happy to take other medicines such as insulin but don't trust the same doctors that prescribe vaccinesThis. I’m a transplant recipient. The drugs I take everyday to prevent rejection have a number of side effects and are brutal to the rest of your body. I was surprised at the amount of other transplant recipients who don’t want the vaccine because it’s not fda approved or they don’t know what’s in it or how it will affect them.>“Fuck doctors i have my own natural immunity!”\s\s>”Please help me doctor i’m dying of covid!”this guy makes senseHis point is spot on the pain in his eyes is heartbreaking......So you'd rather millions couldn't get a life saving vaccine because a tiny percentage might have a bad reaction? Do you know how many people are allergic to penicillin or sulpha drug's? Should we cease manufacturing those so that people can start dieing an ugly death again or lose a limb  because a minor injury got infected because some people have a bad reaction and won't know it til it happens? And the drug company gets sued to the point that it refuses to make them any more? I'd rather the people it works for have a life or limb saving chance. I have a horrible reaction to wellbutrin there's no way I'd want all of the people it works for to not have access because it doesn't work for me.\s\sYou save that action for the companies that purposely put out a faulty and dangerous product.Take me to church!100%! Stay at home and use your essential oils to cure your ass.Don't forget thoughts and prayers.And zincHonestly hospitals should start turning away unvaccinated people who are sick with COVID if there is not enough room. The vaccine is free. It’s literally lottery’s in most states incentivizing people to get it. At this point it’s their fault if they’re unvaccinated. \s\sHad a good friend go in for an emergency (to the point where she might need surgery) and got told to go home because there were no more beds and COVID patients were taking up too much space. \s\sShit is so aggravating.

It justifiable for him to be upset but he shouldn’t be angry at people for getting the disease as you don’t know the situation behind it.The point of the vaccine is not to make you immune to the virus... the point of the vaccine is to get you by the virus  whithout going to the hospital...the point of the vaccine is to stop overcrowding of hospitals until we get heard immunityYeah no one is Angry at people in that situation. That’s 10% max of vaccinated people. They’re not the ones filling up hospitals.I thought he was gonna go on about some conspiracy theory at first. Then I thought against it because that kind of content gets banned quick on here..\s\sGlad I listened the whole way through because he has a damn good point.As someone whose step father guided my mother through an arduous 7 year journey spanning multiple states and hospitals that is the face of someone who has been strong their entire life and are now being fucked by something outside of their own power. Just to be further fucked by something in someone else’s power a cold fury that’s very sad to seeI found out my friend is not getting the vaccine or at least isn't in a rush. I was shocked. I've known her since kids and she was vaccinated back then against the usual stuff. \s\sMeanwhile I'm typing this after just getting my second shot (I'm so happy!). I can't get her selfishness. Even if not for her for other people. Her father passed from cancer due to something he picked up. I don't get how she doesn't think ""Wow I'd hate to cause that with someone due to COVID"" like this man's wife here. \s\sHonestly making me rethink being friends with her.\s\sPeople are just assholesYup I've had to put off my surgery for the last year. I'm now developing diabetes and look like a damn rail because my pancreas is shutting down. I'm so fucking sick of it. These selfish mother fuckers get the care they need because they choose to get not get vaccinated and choose not to wear a mask. I didn't choose my illness I did nothing to bring on my illness. I'm tired my body is not doing well. I want to be here for my kids and I fear with my pancreas shutting down and if I get covid it's going to be the tipping point on my body..My husband desperately needs knee replacement surgery but nope gotta keep waiting.I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. I hope you are able to get the care you deserve soon. It’s disgraceful that your health isn’t prioritized over those who refuse to do what’s right. \s\sI know it doesn’t really mean anything but I’m going to be thinking of you. I wish I could give you more than the tHoUgHts aND pRaYErs we all make fun of. Just know that I genuinely hope you get the health care you need and find some relief soon. ❤️What surgery is it out of interest? I know diabetes is fucking shitty (i'm type 1) but its definitely manageable and isn't a death sentence. Theres lots of support on reddit for dealing with it should it get to that point but i'm hoping you can avoid it and get that surgery soon.\s\sThough to be honest with you if you're at risk of type 1 then it was destined to happen essentially and i'm unaware of any preventative action you can take to stop it since its autoimmune. \s\sSending you well wishes!As a nurse....this just makes me so upset like we are failing our patients hearing things like this. It pains me that people like you who didn't do anything to bring on your illness get to suffer while the medical field is at its breaking point. But in reality it's the selfish assholes who won't get vaccinated that is truly ruining it. I know sorry doesn't mean much from a stranger on the internet but my heart does go out to you. It sucks to hear you are suffering.That's really sad I really wish you the best of luck and let's hope you get the surgery asap.Buddy. I’ll keep you in my prayers today. I don’t know your name. But I’ll think you and hope all is well. I know prayers don’t answer. I 100% understand. But I hope you get help and pray that the hospital can help you much quicker than the idiots out there who believe praying will cure them. Praying is just a hope. Not a guarantee. Like when one says. I hope to be able to run a mile. You train for the mile. You don’t just sit and expect it. May you find the help. As someone with medication that’s back ordered due to this as well I understand the lack of help.That's really awful. Have you tried going on a plant-based diet? Many people seem to report significant improvements in their diabetes condition after switching.I wonder if we could get unvaccinated folks to also sign a notorized letter saying they will also refuse care should they contract the virus. Either vaccinate or stay unvaccinated and refuse care. Wonder how many of them would sign it or opt to get vaccinated.WordBetter check your facts before making such a strong statement!!!\sEven vaccinated  people STILL GET THE VIRUS. STILL GO TO HOSPITAL. STILL DIE.\sSo who is the real idiot here?Less than %1 of the people going to the hospital with covid are vaccinated buddy. If people were being responsible and getting vaccinated the hospitals wouldn’t be overrun. This is your fault you shouldn’t be allowed to make life worse for other people.hey remember when he said that 99% of the people are unvaccinated? That 1% accounts for the vaccinated which is why he said that. Use your ears.>So who is the real idiot here?\s\sLol still you buddy. \s\sThe vaccines prevent serious illness waaaaaaaay WAY FUCKING BETTER than no vaccine. \s\sLike how many times does someone need to explain this to you? Lmao. You people are unreal. Un fucking believable>So who is the real idiot here?\s\sPeople that trust Facebook memes conservative punditry and opinions instead of science and scientists?Please please get vaccinated. I work as a respiratory therapist and honestly im just burned out im tired of seeing people die im just tired of all of this covid shit.I’m an RT too I’m also tired af. I live in a very conservative area with my county being one of the most chronically ill in the state before Covid. Hardly anyone has gotten the vaccine here and I’m tired of having heartfelt conversations with my loved ones about my burnout and fear only for them to stay unvaccinated…Respiratory therapist here and I'm still shocked every time I see a healthy appearing person on 40 l of flow at 100% FiO2 on vaportherm rollover and see their SPO2 drop into the 60s.\s\sWe've been dealing with this for a year and a half and my mind still says what the fuck.As gruesome/heartless as it sounds… Those deaths might result in less people voting for ignorant shit.Then do the right thing. Refuse treatment to the anti-vaccinated.ICU/PCU tech watched a 80yo man hold the hand of his 90yo wife of fifty-something years as she took two hours to die after her vent was removed for the last time at his request. Fuck antivaxxers.I couldn't agree with this man more.  Don't trust science?  Spreading a virus you knew about but refused to get vaccinated? No hospital no meds  no help.\s\sStop taking beds from people who actually need help.  Who aren't there because they are fucking stupid.[deleted]I could see the pain too. The feeling of helplessness it's scary.Yup. Work in the NICU. We went back to allowing one parent per day getting to visit their sick baby again instead of both because people can’t behave. So many people then get mad at us for the visitation rules instead of directing their anger at the people who couldn’t be bothered to vaccinate or mask up and made this pandemic so much worse.\s\sThis guy’s TikTok video is legit. I feel so bad for him and his wife./r/UnexpectedPreach!I am 1000% behind this guy.Hit um where it hurts. No insurance coverage for those who choose to exercise there right to not get a vaccine. Smokers premiums are through the roof. Why not antivaxxers.Yes x 1000.  Hope your wife beats the shit outta the cancer!Thank you! \sThey absolutely shouldn’t get medical care if they refused the vaccine. They’ve made their bed. They need to stop making their problems everyone else’s problemFuckinAn acquaintance of mine's mother died yesterday due to COVID.  She was unvaccinated because she didn't trust that vaccine ""not to kill her"".  COVID did it for her.\s\sThis is after her sister died from the virus last year.  And even after all that her son son wrote on Facebook this morning that the vaccine is useless and a government hoax despite his mother dying hours earlier.  It's MADDENING.What the fuck.We’re going to have to triage for vaccinated only. Otherwise the entire health care system is going to collapse. \s\sIt’s inevitable. Not vaccinated by choice as an adult? Get Covid-19 bad enough for the ER? \s\sTough shit.In my country you can only get vaccinated if you are over a certain age right now so when we got the opportunity at work to get the vaccine regardless of age (health care recruitment company) only 20% of employees signed up.  When asked why the majority said ""we dont plan on travelling""..... I cannot fathom this logic.  We are right in the middle of the third wave and nobody cares.  Until they get sick.Well said. 👏Agree 100%. I got pulled to cover our COVID ICU and often times the dad would be intubated while the rest of the family was also sick with Covid either at home or also in the hospital somewhere. Families want us to do everything to keep their loved one alive and we'll do what we can. But they didn't do the one (easy and free) thing that could protect them in the first place. Next time I'm in clinic and faced with an anti-vax patient I'm going to have a goals of care discussion. Or at least encourage them to talk to their whole family so that everybody is on the same page. That way if they're in the hospital that's not the first time a doctor is talking to them about how far they are willing to go.BooooooooOutpatientIf you don't trust the police dont ever call them\s\sthis is fucking stupid. you can be skeptical of the pharma-money-infused research arm of the medical field without throwing the baby out with the bathwater and distrusting all doctors. my god discourse is literally child-tier these daysUnfortunately these individuals' right to skepticism does not just concern only themselves in this case. Their skepticism of the vaccine paired with their willful refusal to follow non-pharma-money-infused directions like WEARING A FUCKING MASK AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING has made this a massive public health concern. Especially for those who are immunocompromised and/or unable to get vaccinated themselves. These skeptics cant have it all ways: not getting the vaccine not following CDC guidelines and then also sucking up all of the healthcare resources without repercussions. Seriously what selfish self-centered pricks.I’m so fucking tired of adults acting like little shitheads because they don’t want to get the vaccine or wear a mask. They are so ugly to look at. This man preached the truth.Do you mean the Dr’s and nurses that are protesting the shot?You mean a super small minority of doctors and a small percentage of nurses? They are actually getting fired from most health systems if they don’t vaccinate so that solves that :)There’s no way I would be this calm and composed if it were me and my spouse. I wish him and his wife the very best.WELL SAIDPreach sir!Right on man![deleted]Who made the vaccine? The government?.... as somebody who had covid stayed at home in bed and struggled because I didn't feel I was sick enough to go to the hospital. It was rough and I was overweight at the time. The symptoms were uncomfortable. The tightness in the chest? Yeah not that terrible.\s\sMy husband went down the stairs 2 weeks ago split between his toes. Blood all over the place. Rushed him up to the ER only for him to wait damn near 12 hours to get it stitched up... all because people with ""covid"" kept coming in. When in reality when he was with the techs sewing him up is that people are panicking in our area. Why? We have heavy smoke in the area from the Cali fires. Everybody who is a little tight in the chest and coughing ITS COVID! \s\sI developed asthma from covid. My chest is terribly tight and I can't take a full breath. I'm using my inhaler. I'm not panicked unless I turn blue all from smoke. So let's factor in that matter to. People freaking over the hiccupsUgh i hope this gets shared a lot...Can't argue with that logic.This man spitting facts. I’m so tired of hearing about people not wanting to get the vaccine and covid is fake because *insert reason* something something Facebook.Preach on brother!!! I couldn’t tell you how many times I have said this!!!The people who get Covid and have a “humbling” moment deserve to burn in hell. Such self-entitled scum.The best part is when they encourage others to get vaxxed right before they die.All though they suck dont ya think it's a little extreme to say they deserve to burn in hell? Lol\s\sNot saying I am one of these people nor am I excusing their stupidity or selfishness.Set up tents slap them on a cot with aspirin and water and let them tough it out. No one like that man's wife should ever be sent home because some dumb fuck anti vaxxer big mouth got Covid. Fuck them.Damn this man is speaking facts! 💯Because pharmaceutical companies exist to make money and nurses and doctors are there to genuinely help those who fall ill.Is that why over 90% of doctors chose to get vaccinated? \s\sExplain why the vaccine is bad other than mentioning vague BS.Agreed! You should not run to the hospital or trust the medical community yes. Medical malpractice accounts for more yearly deaths than cancer and heart failure ~~*combined*~~ (see below). COVID is typically mild illness you can treat at home with Vit D and Zinc. Ivermectin also shown to be very effective. At hospital they will vent you - death sentence. Or prescribe steroids - death sentence. If you go to the hospital be informed so they don't kill you but generally best to avoid yes.\s\sEdit: If you check it's 3rd behind cancer and heart illness if you accept the 250000 figure. But figure is likely much higher. Depends how it is calculated and by whom. Have seen as high as 700000 yearly deaths from medical malpractice. Nonetheless at 3rd leading cause it's a real serious consideration you have to make for yourself.So your edit demonstrates everything you’ve stated is incorrect… good luck with that D and Zinc. Don’t inject bleach buddy""COVID is typically a mild illness""\s4.3 million people dead in 1.5 years and it is probably more (Russia Brazil China etc. Are probably misreporting deaths). \s\sI know you're probably going to compare it to the annual deaths of something like war or heart disease or cancer and say ""See! COVID is nothing compared to these"" and tell us how low the risk is. But please don't forget the other causes of deaths didn't go away we lost 4.3 million MORE people in the last 1.5 years than we should have.\s\sI know you are also going to tell me that number is fake. That doctors will report any death as COVID because the government told them to. You're probably going to say that most of those deaths were the flu or a cold or something that looks like COVID but isn't. Now I want to know with over 600k dead in the United States do you think every single one of those deaths was ""malpractice"" or ""something else""? Do you think the families of all 600k are sitting idle while they watch doctors change the cause of death of their loved one? There are people who have watched their family get torn apart losing parents grandparents children siblings or more in the matter of weeks and do you think they thought to themselves ""COVID is a mild illness. My wife should have taken more Vit D and Zinc when she got it then maybe she wouldn't have died in her sleep""? If you truly believe that then you have provided me with a live example of the saying ""Ignorance is bliss"". I truly hope you don't get COVID and if you do your Vit D and Zinc work for you however if they don't I encourage you to put aside pride and seek medical help. Value your life over your agenda.I have no words.YEET those bitches off hospital property with a damn trebuchet!I was making this argument back during the Obamacare arguments and still make it for M4A.\s\sNobody opts out of healthcare. You might say you have a right to refuse to pay for insurance but what would you do if you felt yourself having a heart attack right now? Would that change if you didn’t have insurance and couldn’t pay? Nah you go to the hospital and tell the bill collectors to fuck themselves.\s\sOh then why would you expect others to politely and quietly lie down and die so they don’t increase your taxes by a few pennies a paycheck?If you don't trust science and doctors so much that you're refusing the vaccination then keep that same energy and stay at home gasping for breath. Stop wasting everyone's time and resources.Yea that’s…literally what the video said…There’s no way these people would stay at home and self quarantine though.  At least stuck in the hospital they aren’t spreading it to everyone at the grocery store like usual.  \s\sI’m a nurse on a covid unit.  Every covid patient I’ve ever had has been unvaccinated.  Never had a vaccinated patient yet.This guy is spitting absolute facts! Hope his wife is doing well also.Americans are so fucking stupid i swear. No other developed country has this problem; Germany doesn't have this problem new Zealand doesn't have this problem even england doesn't have this problem god Damn.Wasn’t it a nurse in Germany that replaced thousands of vaccines with saline?We absolutely have antivaxxers in New ZealandAmenI feel for this guy and his wife he’s completely right fuck those selfish people who won’t get the vaccine attention seeking assholes who are on the wrong side of history.Hell yeah bro. Right on.Not a cringe at allFucking preach it!I feel so bad for this man and his wife. It is so incredibly unfair that she who believes in science who was (if possible with her condition) likely vaccinated was kicked out of the hospital and unable to receive the care she needed to make her comfortable. Breast cancer is no joke - I know this because I've seen the effects of it first hand on my own mother (a five year survivor). \s\sI'm not a cruel or vindictive person by nature although I do have my moments where I can be mean and hateful just like everybody else.  I can absolutely see where he's coming from in telling the people who believe COVID-19 is a hoax and anti-vaxxers to stick to their beliefs and not go to hospital when they get the virus. I find myself agreeing with him despite my better side trying to be compassionate for those who are ill. I've been in hospital 3 times since the end of April and had to go to the ER five times since then. Had I been unable to receive the care I needed like the emergency surgery to remove my infected gallbladder or the treatment 2hem I went septic *twice* (once in May while recovering from surgery the second in June) as a result of a bile leak I likely wouldn't be here to type this response on my cellphone. I likely would be dead and my husband a widower after only 2.5 years of marriage. \s\sSo yes.  I absolutely see where he's coming from and empathize with his anger and disappointment about his wife not receiving the care she needed because a COVID-19 patient needed her bed. As far as I'm concerned she had a better right to it as she was there first and still in need of care so they were essentially discharging her against medical advice because she needed a procedure done that had to be done in hospital! That's horrible and inexcusable on the hospital's part in my not-so-humble opinion. Treat the patient that was there first for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster *and* all that is sacred and holy let them recover and *then* and only then discharge them. This discharging the poor woman who is suffering and in great pain in favor of a COVID-19 patient is inexcusable. \s\sForgive me for the long reply here but I am absolutely disgusted disappointed saddened and angered by the hospital's actions in the case of his wife. I feel so bad for him and I sincerely hope that they are able to find a hospital that will treat her somewhere soon. I cannot imagine the pain she must be in. Let the COVID-19 deniers and anti-vaxxers stick to their beliefs. I agree - they don't need to go to hospital if they don't believe the science that gives them a way to prevent themselves from catching this disease and/or mitigates its effects if they do catch it.I like this guy. Spitting truth.""Fuck everybody else this will never happen to me. Why should I risk my own health for other people?""  \s""Oh shit it happened to me! Fuck everybody else I need help!"" \s\sDo you see a common pattern here?It’s a pattern of biases. Don’t trust the medical professionals… except when I need them. Don’t trust the government/authorities… except quote the CDC because they haven’t approved the vaccine yet. They’re picking and choosing whatever fits their fantasies and most of the things they’re picking and choosing aren’t even reliable sources… or misconstrued to fit their fantasy. I don’t know how people can live in complete contradiction with themselves.""happen to me"" \s\sEither it will or won't. Either way it's all about me.Yup. We're selfish bunch. Fuck all of those that don't get the vaccine and the go running to the hospitals when they get it. I wish we could put those fuckers outside in tents.This goldHow dare you talk about the Christian (republican) party like that. \s\s/s\s\sYes I’m aware not all republicans are like that but statistically there are less likely to get the vaccine. Even though it came out during trumps administration but sure let’s keep bitching about it and refuse it.I don't live in the states but wondering how many people are vaccinated over there? I myself am still waiting to get the vaccine tho :cIt go's by states. Vermont is over 68% Massachusetts 64.5 Alabama and Mississippi are about 35%. Average for all together is 50.3%. It seems to roughly follow the quality of education. Not completely but definitely a trend.\s   What's the percentage where you are?When he tears up talking about his wife i just cant. Please just get the vaccine if you can its not about your selfish *ssHe’s that guy.As a physician all I can say is AMEN to this. Should be a PSA on every cable show.Germany is refusing Covid tests to the unvaccinated. Good.Many of us are feeling just like this guy. I’ve got a father with stage iv cancer and they just did the same damn thing to him 🥺As a medical worker; preach it brother. Say it for all of us who can’t say it to their faces.Hospitals should stop accepting non-vaccinated people in my opinion. It’s done. Let’s move on with or without the ignorant and selfish… PLEASE.Cool let's do that...let also allow those people to not have to pay Medicare and medicaid taxes that keep those hospitals in business. If not you create a serf class.YES!!!!!!!!People who are vaccinated are getting sick as well….Yeah? And? His point still stands? Like as of the beginning of august 97% of hospitalizations are unvaccinated people?It's a bat borne virus they are notorious for breeding fast replicators.\s\sBat immune systems are way better than ours and this survives in bats.\s\sSo that's not the cut you think it is but a glimpse into the long term severity of this. For a lot of people it just doesn't go awayDo you understand percentagesyeah but comparatively very little masks nor vaccines are 100% effective but they certainly decrease odds massively (masks less so hence why vaccines are necessary).\s\sAnd that's not even taking into account new variants that keep mutating that the vaccine cant protect against because unvaccinated people being cesspools for the virus to thrive and change. this is why its so important to vaccinate as many people as possible.\s\sand also its quite important to know that the covid vaccine is actually one of the most effective vaccines period research is showing that its effectiveness is somewhere in the realm of like 80% that's ABSOLUTELY INSANE for a vaccine most every other vaccine we have for other illnesses are WAY less effective than this and yet they are still common place and HIGHLY recommended. The new mRNA technology behind covid vaccines are looking to be insanely effective and the impact it will have on the rest of vaccination is going to be insane but for now get your ass vaccinated against covid don't be selfishThis is so true I’m with him 100% .

I feel like people never paid attention in Elementary/Middle School science parasites are not viruses.\s\sKinda curious what other things people are taking around the world thinking it will protect them from COVID-19.I’m my country (Brazil) it’s also a human medicine that doctors ( not all of them) recommend. My doctor doesn’t my dad’s (and my dads friends who are doctors) does. It’s so confusing bc the argument is that “there isn’t enough evidence to prove it doesn’t do anything against covid”\s\sLike what?Ivermectin was promoted to treat COVID in early 2020 as a preventative care measure until wide spread vaccine adoption happened. Early studies suggested that it was effective but not anymore. Ivermectin was used a lot in poorer countries as it's cheap and available Peru even made it official policy to use it to fight COVID for a while as they didn't have access to the same health care resources richer countries do like the US or in Europe. \s\sThe horse version is used a lot because it available compared the human version that mostly sold out and there's been a long history of people not being able to afford the human version of a drug so they buy veterinary versions instead this is resulting in people are taking to much and overdosing and going blind all to avoid getting a vaccine.It’s happening in [Canada](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/ivermectin-horse-drug-covid-canada-va8b11f55) and here in [Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/30/australian-imports-of-ivermectin-increase-10-fold-prompting-warning-from-tga) too (not to the same degree as the US mind you).I’m American and I’ve never heard of it 🤷🏻‍♂️my state is within the top 10 of vaccination rates thoughI'm American and had to look into the comment to see if some had explained what is was[deleted]>cause medicare is nonexistent over there.\s\sThis is not the reason at all. COVID testing and vaccination are free in the US as are some other forms of COVID treatment for people confirmed to be infected. These people are taking ivermectin for a different reason than because they want to avoid spending money. They are doing it because they have been manipulated by propagandists to distrust anything scientists and liberal politicians recommend.\s\sThis is a political problem not a healthcare one. Not that our healthcare system doesn't have its many flaws. They just aren't relevant to this particular situation.Who cares what people thinkYou say you were only ever embarrassed buying 3 things in your life but those sunglasses determined that was a lie.I really thought those sunglasses were going to be the embarrassing purchase.That was my thought too but the actual purchase makes sense too.I thought it was her mismatch foundation on her face.Oxford is studying the use of ivermectin to treat covid because it has been shown to reduce covid replication rates in a lab setting and some efficacy in smaller studies…\s\shttps://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-06-23-ivermectin-be-investigated-possible-treatment-covid-19-oxford-s-principle-trialShould have felt bad about buying those sunglassesthose sunglassed fuck you're just boringWhy is it embarrassing to buy tampons how y’all get them before???I imagine she was referring to her first time purchasing them which can be awkward for a young woman.Someone should tell her that Ivermectin was invented in the 1970's to prevent parasitic infections in HUMANS and has saved literally millions of peoples lives. \s\sSomeone should tell her that the inventors won a Nobel Prize in 2015 for their services to 'humanity' - not to veterinary science. \s\sSomeone should tell her that Japan's health body chief has given doctors the authority to use it on humans for Covid-19. It is also used in India where the Covid-19 rates have fallen dramatically ever since. \s\sOh and like penicillin and antibiotics ivermectin is sometimes used to treat animal infections too. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sBig pharma don't want you to know that a non-proprietary (i.e. cheap) drug they don't own which any company has a right to make is very cheap and effective. Keep pushing the big pharma propaganda all you want or do your own research on it.The stuff you buy at Tractor Supply Center is not the same thing as Ivermectin that is used to treat humans.\s\sUnless you have a prescription for Ivermectin you should not be taking it especially when it's included in a compound for animals.\s\sThis isn't hard. Stop eating horse paste.Okay…okay enough with this horse shit….She’s a nut jobI thought she was going to refer to those sunglasses.inb4 this whole ivermectin conspiracy was blown wayyy out of proportion by big horse pharma to sell more horse products.Next time ride in on your horse so they know you’re the real deal.Ngl I thought she was an actual Karen with the way she was talking and those sunglasses but at the end I really could feel her pain. Damn that must have been embarrassing.I do this when I buy Ring-Pops as a grown man. I always buy two and then two bags of Gummi bears so it looks like I have kids. 🙃That orange face makeup job. 🎃I was legitimately out of toilet paper when people were hoarding it. Worst shopping experience of my life.I wonder if those people are still trying to use all that TP they hoarded. When my GF and I worked at the office we bought 2 Costco packs that lasted us a year and we still had like half a pack left.\s\sLPT: office dumps are great way to decompress two ways at once.You could try a bidet bottle. Like the FridaMom one or any generic one online if you can’t install a bidet to your toilet. That’s what I use.If you have a washing machine you can just use your socks.Never had I felt more grateful for being a bulk/bargain/coupon shopper than when my family didn’t have to buy TP when the shelves were clear of it at my local stores. I always have alerts set on a deal site for sales on most household and personal care items that we utilize…so amongst many other items we always have at least 6 months worth of TP stored in our home. I encourage anyone with the space to do so to do the same. Not only is it easier on the wallet but there’s also less trips to stores and we don’t have to worry if there’s any kind of emergency that causes a shortage of stock or funds.My mom asked me to go get some because she was running low. Neither of us keep much up with the news I went to three stores that were totally out of TP and then my car broke down. \s\sI can laugh now but holy god I was so mad that day lol.Same.\s\sHad to go to three different stores wound up at a dollar general. Everyone in line had toilet paper. Some had multiple packs some had a mountain in their shopping cart and I just had my pack. I felt so bad for the old lady that checked us all out I hoped they got some necessities.No one was judging you if you got just one pack.  Doesn't matter if it's 2 rolls or 32 if you were just grabbing one pack everyone actually knew you needed it probably desperately.  It was the cunts with the cart full of packs... we all judged them as stupid selfish pricks.  But one pack?  Hey we all gotta shit.I use Ivermectin for my dogs and cats. It can be used to treat for mange mites heart worm prevention regular worming etc. Its a great medicine and saves me a ton of money buying it OTC. \s\sI’m SO glad that my bottle is full and I don’t have to buy more anytime soon. It would be TP embarrassment all over again.Omg same. Well I think we had a couple rolls left but it was sold out everywhere so it was going to be an issue soon. I was at walmart one day just getting other stuff and I checked for TP gone okay whatever maybe next time. Then a worker wheeled out 1 pallet and I'm like oh perfect. So I stand off to the side while he parks it in the aisle. Then slowly like 10 people all gather up like its black friday.\s\sAnyways he cuts the plastic off and I grab a jumbo pack and move on. But a swarm of people start grabbing it all up. Crazy.Same my gf and I were watching the news like “look at all these fools” then we realized we were down to 2 rolls. Had to drive to like 6 different stores.The only toilet paper I could find was a cheap lavender scented kind. It was basically 2 ply and smelled like my grandma.Cut the sleeves off your old t shirts you get shitrags from the sleeves and a bitchin' sleeveless shirt.Flushable wipes. You will never go back.Wtf is this ivermectin wubba dubba doo thingIt's so important what the register lady thinkssomething similar happened to me last year.\s\sright around the time that anti-science folks were spreading the idea that drinking bleach could cleanse you of covid i accidentally drank some. i had reused a water bottle to create a bleach mix for cleaning purposes and mindlessly reached for it and drank some before realizing it wasn't pure water.\s\si had to call poison control and couldn't stop laughing my ass off while i was on the line because i knew what they must be thinking. i'm probably included in a statistic somewhere of people who followed that incredibly stupid advice.. although *accidentally* drinking bleach wasn't necessarily the smartest move on my partBut like...\s\sDid it cure your covid? LolI thought one of those embarrassing purchases she was listing was gonna be her eyebrowsI thought she was going to say those glassesI really thought she was gonna say the foundation cuz that shade match is just a tad but off.A little bit of objectivity is always welcome.\s\shttps://youtu.be/WzFasRjQuB4\s\sAlso: Stop caring about what others think.\s\sEdit: leave it to Reddit to downvote anything thats open minded for all and no sides.You are a fucking nut job. You can see that shit a mile away.Please use a foundation that matches you natural skin toneIvermectin is used to treat PARASITES in animals and sometimes humans. Covid is NOT a damn PARASITE. It's a VIRUS. I cannot grasp the complete f**king stupidity of these people!\s\sThey claim Covid is ""just a flu"" or doesn't even exist because CONSPIRACY. Then they poke a parasitic down their throats. For WHAT???It also has an effect on bacteria and viruses.Had me in the first half not gonna lieI literally totally completely thought she was going to say the third thing were those sunglassesMy god grow up \s""I bought condoms holy shit soo embarrassing omg and tampons oh Holy moly""\sReally?\sI had to buy meds because I nearly ripped me a second one. I was bleeding every time I had a shit. And everybody thinks I had a hard butt fuq. \sSo what? People will keep thinking whatever they wanna think. Just grow the heck up and don't give a damn.I had similar moment when the mask requirements changed. I still wore my mask in a lot of places even though I was vaccinated. I was always conscious of the fact that some might think I was anti vax or some shit.Funny as hell but I feel for her embarrassment. I'd feel it too if I had to buy it for a legit purchase while everyone else was quack medicating themselves with it.I bought dogecoinYikesThe first should have been those sunglasses.She has amazing delivery lmaoI would never medicate myself and there’s a lot of research to be done but it’s not totally unfounded.  In June Oxford University began an in depth study of ivermectin. They reported that ivermectin is a broad spectrum antiparasitic that reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in laboratory studies.  Early days but Israel has been doing some studies on it as well. Regardless ivermectin for horses and humans is different.  For one thing the doses are much more potent for horses.  Anyway don’t take anything not given to you by a medical professional folks.You might want to double check the study you're citing isn't [this one](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100956/v4) because it was [recalled after ethical concerns were raised](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns)The only thing I can see is the difference in colour between her neck and faceAre we still embarrassed about buying contraceptives and tampons? Please can that be the next thing millennials kill.“Oh no my feelings!!”Honestly I'd leave all my shit at the register and find a new store of this is the case.The third time should be those glassesThis is honestly one of my favorite subs now good job everybody.👏We used our sons baby wipes during that time. We had just bought a Costco bag of TP like 2 weeks before the lockdown and a box of wipes so that lasted us through that fiasco.That’s like buying denture glue with the purchase of condoms so ppl will think it’s for ya grandma…Now I know how it's pronouncedDidn't hear people doing that until a few days ago. I completely shut off from the entire world for a whole year and a lot has happened. I'm tired. I want to go back to blissful ignorance.I never only ever been embarrassed about one where I asked it be tripled bagged and that was buying pregnancy tests. Worst experience everFake news. The story about hospitals clogged with people because they bought ""horse paste"" was 100% fabricated and the drug is actually prescribed to humans. Not saying it's the cure but I dont see people humiliating JW's for trying to pray disease away or hippies and crystals and yoga. \s\sKeep up the misinformation campaign. How many times can we fit horse paste into a news cycle!>Fake news. The story about hospitals clogged with people because they bought ""horse paste"" was 100% fabricated and the drug is actually prescribed to humans.\s\sThat's a single story. Animal feed stores across the country are seeing their ivermectin stock deplete **much** faster than [normal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/25/ivermectin-livestock-deworming-drug-poison-control/5583817001/). State [poison control](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/08/30/fact-check-590-spike-texas-poison-control-calls-ivermectin/5643254001/) networks are seeing a higher rates of ivermectin-related calls.God for bid buying medicine that actually might help fight covid other than a vaccine. So embarrassing…I thought she was going to say it was her love heart glasses!Lmao who tf came up with the idea that HORSE medicine for HORSES would treat humans? It's a HORSE dewormer for H O R S E SIvermectin is an anti-parisitic medicine that's been used for treating humans since the 1980s.I don't know if you should use it to treat covid but it's safe for humans.Not in this composition or dosing.I thought it was going to be those glasses...Fourth time she was embarrassed making a purchase — when she asked at a makeup counter about her face not matching her neck.You shouldn't be embarrassed to buy tampons and condoms. \s\sAs a female-bodied human everyone should already know you bleed out once a month. It's normal don't act like it's not. \s\sAs a human in general you're gonna wanna get it on and be protected. It's normal.My guess is that she was embrassed when she was buying those for the first time ever. Yeah for an adult that shouldn't be a problem. For a 12-years old girl that has just started getting periods getting hygiene products can be embrassing as hell. Especially if at home they were taught that periods are something that should be kept secret.\s\sSame thing for the first time buying condoms. Not a big deal now but pretty stressful for a teenager. Yeah it's normal. Teenagers will still panic though that's how it is no need to shame them for it.now do suppositories :) *wink*Wouldn't be a problem if Dr's would actually prescribe it.This is like one of those moments when you move in your chair and it makes a fart noise so you try to recreate the noise by exaggerating your movements in the chair so people around you know it wasn't a fart.That’s how I cover up farts.   I move in my chair while I fart.  Then I move again and do a second fart.  Chair gets the blame.  You’re welcome.This happens to me all the time but only with my husband and he isn't trying to hide the second fart noise as much as he is readjusting himself to make the fart reverberate louder.I have had the same experience picking up Hydroxychloroquine the past two yearsI was going to comment abou this here in my country the wackos take IVM and hydroxychloroquine so I saw this girl who have Lupus saying she was embarrassed to buy hydroxychloroquine and kept trying to casually say to the pharmacist the cashier and everyone around “I have Lupus you know? I actually have Lupus you hear me?? I have an autoimmune disease ok??”.I thought your 3rd embarrassing purchase would have been your glasses.Surprised the third embarrassing moment wasn't buying those sunglasses.Foreal that was my first thought.Had to hard google this one to get it. Wtf you guys doing over there that this is a thing...I promise you it’s just stupid people going and buying this stuff in bulk when they don’t actually need it.Blame the GOPI thought it was going to be about ketamine or something lolOh gosh this is legit embarrassmentHad a similar experience buying ivermectin for my horse.  The lady at the feed store was very concerned I was getting it for myself. Appreciated her concern but it made me question what vibe am I giving off to have her think I’m one of those types.That's the thing for a lot of people there isn't a vibe. Plenty of people that are down to take horse meds (and not even the human stuff at least) will be completely cordial and polite and a pleasure to talk to. Then some random thing gets said and all of a sudden an opinion comes out and you're like ""oh..."" It's usually hard to imagine some of these people as anything other than the anti mask lady who wanted to cough at people at the store but plenty of people that are pretty normal have some off the deep end views of politics.I use ivermectin for my rosacia and mix a tiny bit with face cream. I'm so glad I stocked up on it because I dread buying more. Not only that it used to be 6 bucks a tube on Amazon now it's easily $30.You were giving off the “I’m buying Ivermectin” vibeThat's when you pull out your phone and start showcasing your horse. You get to prove you aren't a nutcase and people get to admire your best friend.When the recent level 4 lockdown was happening here in NZ I asked people what they needed from the store (as I stayed late just to stock things so people could buy them). They said they needed milk paracetamol flour and toilet paper. Checkout staff gave me so much shit.I totally feel her pain I’m a horse owner too. But I don’t believe for a second that any horse person EVER goes to the tack or feed store and walks out with just the thing they went in there to purchase! XDThis bitch face is embarrassing""Haha I know what you're thinking but I actually have a horse.""\sProblem solved.“Sure lady” \s\sProblem back :(Same shit happened with me when I was out of toilet paper. And everything then on TV was about how all the idiots were hoarding all the toilet paper. There were even videos of Asian dudes buying it all spreading around on Facebook. ""The Chinese are buying up all our TP!"". I'm from Australia and there was a lot of anti-Chinese views last year after what happened with the virus.\s\sI went to the supermarket and bought a massive packet of toilet paper [48 rolls]. It was the last one avail. I'm also Asian. It was like a walk of shame as I carried that out to my car while everyone was looking lol.I don’t believe her. If she’s a horse owner then she’s also a regular at the feed store and they know her. No one is smirking about her purchase of Zimectrin Gold. Although it has been causing horrible allergic reactions in horses lately so I am going to raise an eyebrow at her dewormer of choice.Mrs. OrangeI legit thought she was going to say her third embarrassing purchase was those sunglasses 😎1/3 of the world’s doctors use ivermectin as a Covid treatmentSource?I was sure she was gonna talk about those horrendous sunglasses.at this point id take pictures with my fucking horse and then be like look here is me with my horse this bitch needs this fuck...Try turning down an unnecessary narcan prescription that was put in with your spouses pain killer prescription because the state supplied insurance ""wants to be sure"" as a heavily tattooed man in his mid 30s.

Right on !!!Ya when I buy condoms I usually throw in a banana and like a time magazine or something to show people I’m not just trying to get fu**edSure people are just going to think you’re rolling a condom over that banana sticking it up your arse and wanking over Time magazine.Aren't people actually getting prescribed Ivermectin though? You can literally talk to your doctor about it. Joe Rogan was actually thinking about suing CNN for pushing a story saying he was taking horse dewormer even though his doctor prescribed legit ivermectin. \s\sIdk maybe tons of people *are* buying this crap to self medicate but it seems like social media and the news is making it sound worse than it is.The human version is prescribed by doctors and used along with other medications to lessen symptoms related to covid to speed up recovery not to treat covid itself. Since covid has so many wildly varying symptoms it’s not an automatic go to just one of many options.\s\sThere are an unfortunate number of people who are using it without prescription and using the version meant for animals which has a very different composition than the human version. There’s no data showing it can effectively be used preventatively against covid and it does not cure covid.Not sure why they would be prescribing it? In the Uk it’s only licensed to be prescribed for ‘river blindness’ scabies & Papulopustular rosacea (pustules of the face) so maybe he has one of these horrid conditions.AAAMMMMEERRRIIICAAAA IS THE DUMBESTReminds me of the scene in Magnolia when Phillip Seymour Hoffman orders a bunch of groceries and porn mags and the lady goes ""do you still want the other stuff?""She even made a video to make us think she wasn’t eating it.. clever.I'm a dude whose never worn makeup even I know that if you use a foundation that doesn't match your skin tone you gotta hit your neck with it too. 🤡As another person with zero makeup experience it's honestly comically bad. I thought it was gonna be a joke video about her buying the wrong shade or something.I couldn't stop staring at that.  This is super common in Asia where women will for whatever reason put makeup only on their faces when they're looking directly at the mirror and for whatever reason never examine it from any other angle.  So you end up with this really harsh line along the jaw.Dude. Me too. I was waiting for her to tie it all in with her makeup disaster. But nope.

No one forced any of these people to sign loans.

That's a fair point but no one put a gun to your head and said sign here please. GOTCHA BITCH!!!No banks were forced to fuck the economy but they did just that and got bailed out.Ah yes the ""17 year olds are in a financially and mentally competent position to make decisions involving hundreds of thousands of dollars with no real world experience living by themselves and with ample prodding by their parents who are just doing what we sorta think society says we should do but none of us really know and that's fine"" defense. a time honored classicClassic reddit.

Nothing is ""free"". Someone pays for that shit. banks and all these financial institutions have money that companies and private citizens give to them so they can loan it out. That's who is getting screwed. Some people want to cancel student debt not because they care about students in debt they just want the government to have more control over the banking industry.

WtfIt was a joke\s\sDudes a comedianThis Guy is AWESOME!!!!As a man who has massive student loans I find the idea that people who took them think they should be forgiven insane and insulting to the working class.

Education is the foundation of democracy the government funding educated citizens should be one of the highest priorities.Lmao “I suffered so others should too”hows the boot tasteAll I have to say here is that I will never understand you people who want others to needlessly suffer purely because of your misplaced spite smh. College shouldn’t cost ridiculous amounts of money to begin with. College degrees are about as important as high school diplomas used to be. The majority of jobs in the economy require post secondary education. And those that don’t almost always treat workers like shit (even more so than the other ones). Workers are being fucked over by their employers not other workers. Saying “no one forced” people to go to college is insultingly ignorant. Are we just going to pretend like people don’t excuse the shitty conditions working class jobs have by saying “they should have gone to college and gotten a real job?” And while I’m sure this is hard for a bootlicker to grasp can you blame anyone for not putting up with it? Or for wanting a chance at a job that pays even semi-decently in a world where the cost of living is increasing way faster than wages? And it’s funny that you’re suggesting that the field students pursue is somehow to blame when some of the worst gaps between debt and payback are for medical fields despite the large salaries. Do you really want a world with a shortage of dentists pharmacists veterinarians and optometrists?Agreed this is just middle class people who made bad decisions looking for a handout. The real poor people don't go to college or take out student loans. They work minimum wage jobs. How is this gonna help them? If we have money to spare in the system it should be going to the most needy first. Not to college graduates.I thought his Netflix show got cancelled.it did. This is from 2019.\s\sIt got cancelled because he was sent death threats and fake anthrax which fell on his son causing his wife to get scared and she had to ask him to stop going after dictators.Disney sent a take down order for the Mickey Mouse clock.  You see a Mickey Mouse clock now?  I thought so.""44 million Americans is too big too fail"" \s\sAmen to that. God that's so refreshing to hear someone say. Do I expect change? No. They might get a digital clock though so I guess that's progress.Hasan Minhaj is the fucking GOAT and has awesome shows. I’ve been to two now of his comedy stand-ups and he makes u cry from laughing while you also want to burn down the entire fucking systemHonestly we need someone like this to run for President. Joe Biden told Trump to “shut up man” and we all loved it. \s\sImagine if we had someone with more wittiness than President Malarkey. Someone young someone with some damn grit who isn’t afraid to tell these Republican criminals what this country is *really* thinking.Someone please tell me what GOAT means I finally have the courage to askI don't understand though why was a comedian testifying to Congress about student debt?politicians: why should we? those banks line up our pockets.Its in the title but no discussion.  He cant read the clock or it was a joke.   I know some only like digital but if you get a degree surely ?I forgot why I loved Hasan Minhaj.Dude was legit. He was making some real positive changes. \s\sI went to his stand up recently and he talked about how he basically has been getting death threats and even got sent fake anthrax that fell on his kid which scared his wife enough to force him to stop going after dictatorsBro I am a Hasan Stan and I've never said that about anyone.\s\sI'm a big Jon Stewart fan and Hasan really takes his torch better than anyone else. I love Jon because he really fucking cares. God bless him for making a change for 911 responders' health. He balanced comedy with integrity and honesty better than anyone else - even Carlin - because he put his money where his mouth is.\s\sAnd Hasan has the same vibes. He is hilarious and his segments in the Daily Show were great ...but then the Patriot Act showed how deep he could get into issues while making them relatable and still funny. He also remains pretty genuine and under all the jokes is a sense of duty and authenticity that Jon has.\s\sBoth are dope but Hasan is still underrated IMO.It was fantastic seeing NRI cry babies when he criticized the current right wing government of India (BJP) in his show. They quickly went from #represent to he doesn’t know what he is talking about.I fell in love with him when he did the White House Correspondence Dinner. I still watch it every couple of months [and you should watch/rewatch it too!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDmSZX_zVuQ&t=1s)I think you'll enjoy this: https://youtu.be/oHROEnsHVeIhe’s one of my favourite comedians/tv hosts: his netflix show was awesome! i want to see one of his shows at some point—i’ve only ever heard good things about himSo sad Netflix axed himI also love HasanThe pop culture references were simply a wonderful way to show the people in charge are incredibly out of touch with modern times. Good on him.His stand up special about philanthropy (and other stuff) blew my freakin mind. \s\sThe way he clearly and simply lays out the corruption of America is greatI miss Patriot ActI didn’t forget but I sure love to be reminded.Can we start a petition to bring Patriot Act back?what was he doing in front of a House panel lolJesus Christ there is so much wrong with what this guy is saying.\s\sFor starters when a bank is bailed out by the government it is done through a loan that the bank has to pay back. So when he says “let’s treat student borrowers the way we treat banks” he clearly doesn’t know what he is talking about. Or he does and he is just taking advantage of people who don’t know what they are talking about. Like everyone upvoteing this nonsense.\s\sAnd second an upwards redistribution of wealth is a horrible fucking idea. There are outliers and those people absolutely deserve help. But the vast majority of people with student loans make more money than those that didn’t go to college. Those that want all student debt to be wiped out are literally a reverse Robinhood. Taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich.\s\sThe reason so many people on reddit and twitter talk about this issue so much isn’t because they care it’s because they are just as selfish as the people they hate the most. It’s all about them and that is all it has ever been about to them.Except when they give out loans and forgive them like they did during covid.[deleted]Oh fuck offYou could always just try being a civilised nation and make education free then anyone with the brains can get it.\s\sGetting an education should never be about making money.\s\sHonestly you're so primitive over there.I LOVED this guy's show. Patriot act was absolutely top tier IMO and I'm truly sad it was canceled.why was it canclled?I wish he would start doing the same thing on YouTube or something. He's probably too scared for his family's well-being though. It's tragic.I watched every episode. I thought he did a really good job of shining light on some fucked up situations. \s\sA lot of his jokes didn't land for me or he would stay on them too long but rhe content was top tier for sure. I wish it would come back.He's got my vote for next leader of government.Lol I will now go back to where I came from. He knows he’s talking to a bunch of racistThe reason the government doesn't care: By law the government doesn't have to care because students borrowed money from private lenders not the government. This is why Biden can't forgive your student loans but did forgive billions in student loans from the government. That ""forgiveness"" was authorized by the Congress. Congress controls the purse strings whether it's to spend or forgive your inability to stop yourself from going into debt.What a legend…..how is this cringe????did I just watched an american politician making sense?No you watched a comedian make more sense than most politiciansI miss Hasan on Netflix!""And I will now go back to where I came from.""\s\sLmfaoooWaters was trying so hard to keep it in lmaoI guarantee that’s in response to the inevitable bigots who instead of listening to his completely valid points will throw out some aggro nonsense to hold onto some reason to be madShe knows. We all know. Heck I've been there myself with some angry folks.  Where did he come from?   And  are they accepting him back after that?This guy is a mfing legendThis man is 🔥This guy is so obnoxious to the point that it's self-defeating.i sorted by controversial to see if someone else had the same thought.  oh what a burn he asked a senator if he knew who a rapper was and made a joke about excel.This dude is my new hero !This is why we need young people in politicsWhy is a comedian talking to Congress about student loans? What I miss?HaOh man I about lost it at ""They want their best options not a CVS receipt."" Preach!SavageOh my god more of this in politics in general please.*who the fook is that guy* -Conor McGregorHasan Minhaj is awesome. I loved his Netflix show Patriot Act and wish it was still on.His  Netflix standup special “Homecoming King” is one of the finest bits of standup I’ve ever seen. It’s hilarious but moving.It was too fucking real.[deleted]He is seriously one of my favorite comedians. But he’s speaking some truthWHO IS THIS MANWhy did he say that about the clock?How did he get through the medal detectors with those giant brass balls?Yeah him for President 2024Why is this guy even there?“Why can’t we treat our student borrowers the way we treat our banks? 44 million Americans that is too big to fail.”\s\s*Yyyyyyyyyyo*Honest discussion/question. Can the humor element minimize this issue? Or is he using it as a platform to subtly go further? Because it kind of looks like they didn’t take it seriouslyShe’s like:  I need to see how real this shit just got!Do they not have an analog clock in their or is it just to far away to readPraising someone on saying fuck all. For gods sake ben shapiro has better arguements than thisI saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack.

We have new ways to rob students now. She and her husband both got away with bank frauds.They don't fucking careFunny story. I recently unknowingly met this guy on the gondola at a ski resort and i had no idea who he was but let me just tell you the nicest guy had a great conversation.“We’ll order a Mickey Mouse clock.” That’s so condescending.Bunch of boomersThe amount of children on reddit that are downvoting people for making valid points instead of having a normal cool headed discussion is too damn high!Not children foreigners who see through the stupidity.I don't get the clock jokethe joke is that he can’t read an analog clockthey are living in a different time and we expect these dinosaurs to vote for the future hahahaBetter dare that lady to actually put a Mickey Mouse clock up.This has some milennial vs boomer “OK boomer” power.This man went off lolIt was a nice attempt.okay I am in love with Hasan MinhajIf you cancel student debt but do nothing in terms of revamping the whole student loan system All you are doing is rewarding the colleges and universities that will continue to charge tuitions that bear no semblance to the return on the investment made. The only reason they can charge crazy tuitions is because people can access the loans to pay that tuition Until that changes nothing will improve and forgiving debt right now at this point in time won’t make any difference.It would cost $80 billion/year to just pay public tuition for all. That's 11% of the DOD budget. The various pandemic bills would cover 55 years of tuition. Trump's tax bills would cover 25. Don't overcomplicate this federal and state funding has decreased increase funding and student loans won't be a thing anymore.Yeah this is what needs to be talked about more. Like I'm all for my debt disappearing.. but put it on hold until we figure out what to do about the system and why we have it in the first place.I agree but that won't happen any time soon unless there's  a massive leap to the progressive side which I don't see happening in the next 20 years at least if ever. So we're stuck with this forever.Seriously all that cancelling current debt would do in the long run is be seen as a political bribe for the current generation. It would not only not fix the problem but draw resentment from everyone that wouldn't benefit from it. It's a crisis but a constantly moving crisis and needs to be treated as such. A stopgap lump sum cancellation would be fine now but would have negative effects in multiple areas.It's also an enormous transfer of wealth upwards to a group that is already wealthier than most Americans. Those who have earned a college degree have significantly higher lifetime earnings than those who have not and that more than makes up for the cost of loans taken out.\s\sMoney is not infinite and if we are going to spend an enormous amount of money on welfare we should spend it on those who are worse off than those who are already going to earn more throughout their lives. Additionally if there is no cap or a not very low cap on loan forgiveness you are transferring wealth to the top earners with law degrees medical degrees and degrees from extremely expensive and exclusive private universities who are the last people who need and should be given government welfare.Agreed but I think (and hope) the current generation is being much more cautious about the debt their willing to take on for a particular major/career. A lot of us millennials were sold a false bill of goods being told ""Go to college no matter what just get that degree. It doesn't matter what you major in any degree and you'll have a good career."" \s\sI was literally told something along those lines by my guidance counselor and that's what you'd hear from your parents and the media too. People took on debt without any real direction just trusting they'll be able to pay it back because that's what society preached. Low and behold your bachelor's of liberal arts ended up meaning jack shit so you end up waiting tables or working retail.I’m in love.This was funny as heckWho is this and why do I love himHassan minhaj he's got some Netflix shows.I disagree with about 80% of Hasan's politics but he is in my top 3 absolute favorite comics. His Netflix special ""Homecoming King"" and political-themed show ""Patriot Act"" are must-watch TV.Just pay ur loans broOOTL why was he testifying in front of congress about loan debt?Because our government is a joke so they have comedians come in and testify on subjects they know little about.analog clocks are useless and shouldnt exist anymorePeople may not get his jokes. The old slow life long government can't keep up with changing times. They have no idea what is going on and being abused.I want to kiss this man on the mouthIs that it? You gonna stop there?you're gonna need to up the ante if you think you're getting thru the rest of us microdicks pal. obv we are already gonna kiss him. it's such a given that it's not even first base it's the fuckin dugout. before we even bat we've licked each other's cavities. now again up the ante. otherwise you get to watch us all day first before you even get a turn ya god damn gaylord.77.3% of all college education is a scam.

This seems like misuse of time.Ah so commoners should just stay in their place.

You only have yourselves to blame.The look on Maxine Waters face at that last joke...This guys stand up sucks but this was okEh Comrades  \sAfter reading the comments it has come to my attention that this reddit hence forth all of reddit nay all of the internet is now just a big propaganda machine for the communists.  \sAs I sit here promoting capitalism with my cheese farts and letting my wife bang her boyfriend I realize the error of my ways and will turn myself into a Capitalistic Pigs Re-Education Center just as soon as I give away my car my iPhone all my belongings as well as that nagging child of mine always asking for food.

You mean the one with *the hands*? Dude got played.Can you explain this to me like I am a not particularly intelligent five year old child?  I know what a Mickey Mouse clock is but I am too stupid to figure out who was insulting whom and why?Is he joking about the clock? He can't be that stupidA MICKEY MOUSE CLOCK IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR THESE KIDS AKA THE SENATEIt would be unfair against people who made responsible decisionsSo he just made a bunch of “funny” comments for clicks I guess? I don’t think he’s really going to change anything hereThe original video on youtube is like 20 minutes long and he talks about the problems in detail this is a cut of all the jokes in the speech the real meat of his argument isn't anywhere on here.Ok so he’s funny but can someone explain why he was granted speaking time? Who chose to put him in that seat for this meeting? Was he the best person for this?Hasan has always been a bro. His the White House Correspondents' Dinner routine is required watching.They will never do it because the debt has to go somewhere. It doesn’t just disappear it get inherited elsewhere.  \sWithout debt we don’t have a functioning economy. Other people’s debt is what our dollars are backed in.\sStart removing huge sums of that debt and you start devaluing the dollar and you risk crashing the economy.So this is what he has been doing. I have wondered where the patriot act got off too. Miss that show.Genius among a bunch of no thinkers”Are you familiar with the rapper Lil Uzi Vert?”\s\s\s”No.”\s\s\sLmaoI wouldn’t take an opinion from a comedian about how to run the nation/city.[deleted]Exactly all the bailout money was paid back with interestIncredible that we continue to hear this talking point over and over...Genuinely don't know: is he asking for a digital clock because there is no clock at all or because there is just an analog clock somewhere in the room?Who is this guy? He should run for Congress!Just a quick question maybe someone can point me in the right direction. So my loans through Navient and nothings changed I thought they sold off all their loans and I thought we got deferments till may. I get calls and emails saying I have to still pay and it’s just navient. Kind of confused. Any help is appreciated.Hasan was a Comedy Central personality so you have to wade through some of his speech but it really is one of the the best speaches about student debt Infront of any government committee I have seen. It is the right amount of humor and facts to keep most interested. Check out his full 5 minute speech [here](https://youtu.be/6kAHBnwQv_s).\sI don't think the clip in OPs link accurately depicts what he had to say.Why is this cringe?“Why can’t we treat our students like we did our banks?”  We do.  We gave banks loans they paid them back ahead of schedule in fact.  Why shouldn’t we expect students to pay back their loans?How do I vote for this guyCan someone guide me where I need to go to figure out how to get my student loans fixed? I went to one of the for profit schools that is now closed and Sallie Mae/Navient was my loan servicer. Please thank youGod damn I like listening to a good Orator.I saw today he is performing in San Diego! I was so excited I paid Ticketmaster their bullshit fees.Never really liked him before now\s\sEdit: not sure if I'm getting downvoted because everyone has always loved this guy or bc everyone hates him and I shouldn't even like this bit??Where did you see him that he wasn't doing literally this? Because this just seems like he brought his Patriot Act stuff to Congress. Same with his White House Correspondents Dinner set which was honestly even more fire than this.You can see why John Stewart showed restraint with his jokes so he could be taken seriously. This looks performativeRemindMe! 1 hourHoly crap? Maxine Waters is still aliveThat wasn't cringe.Watch laterHasan Minhaj is a gemMaxine Waters at the end!!she was like “ooooooo i like this one he feisty”Yes 😆She was just impressed he knew how to use Microsoft Excel because she gets confused on how to run a zoom meeting.Unfortunately Maxine Waters has been at the end for about 20 years. Fucking finish already!I am not american and don't dabble in their politics. The political figures I know are only those that are really often talked about online\s\sSo I'm seeing this guy for the first time and not gonna lie I'd like to see more of him. That was great lolWell from what I've gathered from this thread this was 2019 and fearing the safety of his family has stopped using his platform to speak out against corporations (death threats and fake anthrax got on his kid.)I had Navient for years. Fuck them. Fuck them completely.Savage and well spoken.Not defending this company don't know anything about them they sound bad.  But this guy doesn't seem to be making any viable arguments.  He's making jokes attached to things that don't really strengthen his point.  They just sound kind of good when cut up with music and a racial call-out quencher.    \sI'll collect your downvotes at the doorCrushed it🤣🤣🤣damn yo\s\s![gif](giphy|6MMxtt269tcAM)I’m inclined to believe EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Of those politicians currently are or have been given $$$ by the banking industry.That look from Maxine Waters at the end!Hasan is the man but this needs to be fixed. My wife’s paying 900 a month in just interest one payments start back up.

This election is the fork in the road... another 4 years of trump will do great harm to many factions in not just the US but the entire world.... and if someone like Bernie doesnt get in we'll be stuck with more of the same establishment candidates.... even on the left side.This isn’t what any of this is about but I’d fucking love to not be on the butt end of those damn Europeans’ jokes all the time lol\s\sEven calling the French surrender monkeys has lost it’s charm. International banter just isn’t the same if you’re clearly losing :(That's really what people like Obama and Clinton are worried about Bernie being the real life version of what politicians have worked hard to appear to be and then being beloved by a gratefull people for it.A few days ago I made [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/f6t99q/there_was_a_guy_bernie_sanders_who_wouldve_beaten/fi7xh3e?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) spitballing this idea and found that Biden clip which is the same one in the ad!

I've honestly wondered why no groups have made a video with all of the good things candidates used to say about himI especially love the subtle jab at Bloomberg's ""endorsement from Obama"" ads.\s\sSanders appears more strongly endorsed by his direct opponents that Bloomberg was by Obama in that one.You and the creator are geniuses.This is such a great idea. I hope Bernie catches on and uses it. Like seriously he's gotta use it.Stellar work!  This ad could not be more timely with all these candidates now attacking him.Is there a YouTube link or some easy way to get the video on Facebook?

We should thank him. Biden would have been a much tougher opponent if he and Pete swapped primary votes up to this point.[deleted]That's what all the CEOs say.Fantastic ad!

Even with last night's ticket prices for the audience Sanders turned clear boos into overwhelming applause and cheers by the end. They call him radical and he asks if healthcare for all regardless of income level is radical? Is affordable housing for all radical? Shouldn't our children have a better future than we did or is that too radical? \s\sThey can't stop him at this point. No attack they can come up with is going to connect and make Sanders look bad outside of the cult-like followers Trump had who wouldn't be swayed regardless of what Trump says or does. All the attacks do is highlight his policies and why that's the direction he feels is best and people connect with that message because of how many Americans struggle with the same things every day.>They can't stop him at this point. \s\sThat's one reason why it's better to not start by going after Biden. The other is that the whole point of this ad is to subvert their attacks. It would be counterproductive to include an attack.   \s\s\sI hope this is airing in SC and super Tuesday states I think it could really help.Bernie has the best ads. Makes me hopeful for the general. Hit Trump in the nads the same way.[deleted]That interview was really good. Biden talks of a basic bargain between employer and employee that if you help make the company successful you are rewarded for that and it’s been broken.No greater endorsement than from the competition themselves.Leaving us to wonder where were any of these people at the debate tonight?Finally some unity.2016 Biden pre cognitive decline and pre facelift would have been a great candidate tbh. He unquestionably used to be an excellent speaker but now it's his greatest weakness. Would have mopped the floor with Trump. His decline is sad frankly.Better than Hillary for sure.\s\sBut of course it still should've been Bernie.Well his son died right before he would’ve thrown his hat in the ring. He was devastated and didn’t have the heart to campaign; I don’t blame him but I remember hoping that he would have replaced Clinton back then. At least Biden could have been a boring and largely not controversial President. I was solidly Bernie back then too but I would have at least cast a vote for Biden in the general if he were the nominee.I thought that clip was from the 90s or some shit but then realized it was during Clinton-Sanders in 2016.  How the fuck did he manage to age 30 years in the last 4??Isn't this his third try to be a president?Yeah I think he's definitely bring pressured . He looked genuinely sad after he went so hard on Steyer.How do people not like this guy? Besides the obvious ""He's a communist!!!!"" tired talking point. He cares about people he is charismatic and passionate he's respectful and he's funny. \s\sI know Trumpsters hate the left because we're ""elitist"" and ""rub our education"" in their face but Bernie doesn't...he treats everyone with equal dignity.\s\sYet they still support a half-witted tyrant who can't read. Big oof.Media going to call Sanders a sexist for saying ""i thought it was Sanders/Klobuchar amendment?"" aren`t they?That was funny.  They had a good chemistry there.  Bernie can work with anyone to get worthwhile things done and it seems even some conservatives feel comfortable (even enthusiastic) about voting for him.  His manner is awkward and blunt but strangely puts people at ease and makes them feel safe and reassured - cos you know you're getting exactly what you see and hear.  It's inspiring to follow all this from afar.that was so clearly a friendly teasing exchange so I hope not.""Watch Bernie INTERRUPT a WOMAN to MANSPLAIN something INCORRECTLY! BERNIE BROS are CHEERING!""I think the best part about this is it’s so POSITIVE. There’s no attacks on anyone no negativity in the ad. True democracy means supporting each other.Ok this ad is gold. \s\sI have donated a few times but I feel stifled by my local government job like I can't openly support anyone without risking employment due to living in prime Trump country. And I admit partly because I am incredibly shy about sharing my true feelings/leanings in public. So...what can I do? Besides money of which I have little and voting what else can I do to help promote the first and only politician I actually believe can help make this country better??I gotta tell ya with all the government initiatives Bernie will put in place there are going to be WAY more government jobs and your experience will help your resume.Just donated $10 for you!I absolutely love the positive stuffThis needs to be a TV and played all over the countryThis is fucking brilliant. It's an attack ad that's not an attack ad at all. They used their words but not against them but just pro-Bernie. \s\sLeslie Knope would approve (Bobby Newport would have his feelings hurt.)Would've been hilarious to have this play on CBS during the SC debate.I really dislike Klobuchar and what she advocates and stands for but that clip with her and Bernie was really gosh darn cute. Bernie can make anyone seem likeable.Straight up SavageIs there a way to get a non reddit version of this video?DittoI wish Bernie mentioned what Bloomberg said in this ad during the debateIs this on TV? I really hope it's on TVLmao this is goldWhere is this being used? We should prop it all over FB & IGIt was originally posted on the campaign official IG. I would like to see it on YT and TV as well.Hot damn that's some good shit.The only one missing was Obamano he was there at the end.  Biden is Obama you see.  Guy is exactly the same as Obama. Actually better because Obama was lazy and told Biden to go out and do everything for him and he did it.This was a heartwarming adAnybody got a YouTube link?Holy crap that was one of the best campaign ads I've seen. You really made my day.\s\sIt could be cleaned up but that was amazing.Beautiful idea. Makes all of them look like hypocrites & demonstrates his ability to unite & get support.I feel so so good knowing my donations helped make this!This needs be the most widely spread ad ever. Share this far and wideYou wily sonsabitches!I love it! =)Good positive adThis is actually really wholesomeExposing the hypocrisy.  Nice.\s\sWe are not a Democracy we are not a republic we are not a plutocracy we are governed by a hypocrisy.Anyone a sharable version?Yay!  It was so noticeable how everyone wanted to be with Bernie....until he took the lead in the polls lol and they started attacking him. I just love this nice medicine after last night ❤️👍Where was this uploaded?Originally on the [campaign IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9AsMiSBXtA/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet).Question: I'm gonna watch this at lunch when I'm on wifi. Should I go ahead and make popcorn or will a hamburger be sufficiently satisfying snackage?Good ad. I hope I see it somewhere aside from here! I haven’t encountered any yet. Just Bloomberg.u/vredditdownloaderSo good.Great ad.Is this an actual ad that is being run? Hope soHere is the youtube link for those who need it:\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px9XhtzfiMYYepThis is awesome!This is a great ad. I tried getting a non reddit link (even checked campaign’s IGTV) but could not find it. \s\sAnyone can help? I’d like to share it with everyone I know who can vote.[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px9XhtzfiMY).Is this real?! This is awesome play this everywhere!Very real.This just made my day. The thing I appreciate most about Bernie's ads are that he never takes things out of context. Sure it's a paired down synopsis of what was said but I know for a fact that these are still true to the context of what that person was saying. He and his staff are running a very clean campaign right nowHere's the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Px9XhtzfiMY) version to sharehonestly he should throw some Trump quotes in there too. Seems no one can deny the man's magnificence.If this isn't out there already it needs to be. It needs to be on every Sanders campaign Facebook feed every campaign Twitter account as a pinned tweet every campaign YouTube channel every email blast sent out. \s\sThis needs to be completely carpet-bombed to the American people to see just how much support Bernie has versus the establishment rhetoric we saw last night of ""evil outside-the-box thinking! must destroy!""This is that ad that we needed. Were all these candidates wrong then or are they being disingenuous now? This ad gets the point across so well they're only dumping on him now because they want to be president but when they weren't in it they were all for him.Love itu/VredditDownloaderLove thisHow can I post this on my IG story lolNo idea how IG works but [here it is](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9AsMiSBXtA/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) on the campaign official IG.Brilliant. Air it everywhere!I really like it when Bernies issues or himself gets talked about positively by other candidates and they keep hitting those messages home because THATS what's going to rally more and more support. O really like it because people think damn a lot of what my candidature has been saying Bernie's been saying for years let's go Bernie! It makes people rethink their opinions.I think every Democrat secretly wants Bernie to win. Ideology and aristocratic privilege is probably feeling like a burden to some on an individual level.[Who WE want to vote for Bernie. (Starts at 4:23) - The Kyle Kulinski Show](https://youtu.be/qYr3ip9mduk)This is really well done!I love it!Love thisThis is good you have to remain on the attack as the front runner.""I thought it was Sanders/Klobuchar"" LOLgot em!This should honestly be a commercial.DelightfulProbably the best Bernie ad I've seen.Will it play on SC?Omg yes.He's funny too.Klobuchar has such a grating voiceYou can try to rebrand a piece of it as your own...but nothin’ beats the original.  Sanders 2020!😍Is this real?Yep very real. Was posted to the campaign's official IG and [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px9XhtzfiMY).LOVE IT!I love it! ❤Title should be more along the lines  of even his opponents know.Not choosing to slander the other candidates just reinforces he’s a stand up guy. I absolutely love this idea for their messaging. Don’t give the others fuel to retaliate- just stay on messaging.Can we get a non-reddit format of this video please?[YouTube](https://youtu.be/Px9XhtzfiMY)The spirit of the ad is great but I think they should find different clips for Biden and Klobuchar. \s\sThe clips from the debate where Biden hugs Bernie  and where Amy says she worked with Bernie were from a moment where Bernie was asked about not being liked by anyone. \s\sBiden and Klobuchar showed solidarity with Bernie and it was really kind of them. We shouldn't weaponize their empathy against them.I thought all the candidates currently attack bernie? Is this ad not missleading?Anything with Pete talking is repulsive he needs to be edited out of this.And you people called Bloomberg's joke add ""doctored"" what the fuck?

Keep this shit up!It's exceptionally important.  Makes me happy.\s\sEdit: We physically can't go a fucking thread without people saying that youth vote is irrelevant cause they didn't sweep Texas. It's getting real old real fast. Why did I even bother voting in Colorado for Bernie when all that matters is young voters in Texas.I simply will never be able to pay off my student loan debt. I was naive and believed it when I was told a degree would land me a well paying job and it would pay for itself.  I was sold on a lie. I make enough to pay the interest no more.  This debt will be with me until I die. I can't afford to save for retirement. I will never be able to afford a home or have children.  This is the future that was given to me and I so foolishly accepted at 18 years old fully unknowing what was in store for me.\s\sI'm not the only one who was sold on this lie and is suffering the terrible consequences.  Student loan debt has a chokehold on the future of an entire generation. Something has to give and soon. Or we will break it.\s\sEDIT: Some astroturfers below.

If you're in a state that has early voting annoy them to go and do it early.\s\sEdit: And by share I mean spam your pro Bernie anti Biden stuff everywhere. Spam it like you're being paid to do it. Like Comment Share. Every little bit helps.https://youtu.be/9HdqMAXQtBo\s\sKnow your enemy.Needs to add in that fuckers not voting is why we have Joe Biden.Doesn't matter if young people don't go out and fucking vote bernie.He needs a laundry list on Biden here is one to get the ball rolling:\s\s1. Biden’s support for finance over working-class Americans. His career was [bankrolled by the credit card industry.](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00001669&cycle=CAREER) He delivered for Wall Street by spearheading a bankruptcy bill that made it harder for Americans to [reduce their debts and helped cause the financial crisis.](https://theintercept.com/2020/01/07/joe-biden-student-loans/)He not only authored and voted for that bill he split with Barack Obama and led the battle to vote down [Democratic amendments.](https://prospect.org/politics/bidens-votes-on-the-bankruptcy-bill-middle-class-joe/) This is where we get the [""nothing fundamentally will change""](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/) for Wall Street at the expense of the majority. Most Americans who get ripped off by the financial sector on a daily basis aren’t looking for a candidate who has made their life harder.\s\s2. Second healthcare. On 25 April the day he announced his campaign Biden went straight to a fundraiser [co-hosted](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/25/joe-biden-presidential-bid-lobbyists-fundraiser/) by the chief executive of a major health insurance corporation. He [refuses to sign a pledge to reject money from insurance and pharma execs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/bernie-sanders-health-care.html) and [continues](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/07/20dems-are-taking-money-healthcare/) to raise money from healthcare industry donors (must be a great feeling with this coronavirus spreading yet the poor and middle class will still be under insured by Biden because he doesn't work for you he works for his Wall Street donors). His campaign is being [bankrolled](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/25/joe-biden-super-pac/) by a super Pac run by healthcare lobbyists. What did all these donors get? A healthcare proposal that [preserves the power of the insurance industry](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/07/15/bidencare-system-will-kill-125000-through-uninsurance/) and leaves 10 million Americans uninsured. Don't forget single payer would save the United States [$450 billion a year](https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2020/2/17/1919887/-Yale-Study-Medicare-for-All-saves-450-Billion-and-68-000-Lives-Annually) do you truly think Biden is going to help his voters out or his Wall Street donors?! Think people...think for a second on this do you truly believe Biden on healthcare that he would side with the people or Wall Street!!!\s\s3. Third climate change. Biden signed a pledge not to take money from the fossil fuel industry then broke his promise. Right after a CNN town hall on climate change he held a fundraiser [hosted by the founder of a fossil fuel conglomerate.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/04/joe-biden-questioned-fundraisers-fossil-fuel-ties/2216831001/) With less than [ten years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/) to radically reverse climate change Biden is pushing climate policy that has gotten [dismal reviews](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/12/05/sanders-scores-highest-mark-sunrise-movements-climate-report-card-while-biden-told) from several leading environmental groups.\s\s\sAlso what else am I forgetting?Such strong attacks against other Dems is wrong. If Bernie loses nomination many will say they can't vote for biden so they don't vote at all. It happens every election. When selecting a candidate you need to run a positive campaign. Once against the real opposition go dirty. I'm British socialist labour supporter so I like Bernie but I'm just telling you how to not lose an election.Finally hes pulling out the bankruptcy bill. Hes been super hesitant to pull this knocker out.Something that just dawned on me is he was probably waiting for a 1v1 to actually bring out the big guns so it doesn’t get drowned out in the debates with more candidatesIs it fair to say Bernie was biding his time? Get'em Bernie! You're in trouble now Biden.Well it’s a little embarrassing for the party since they held Congress and the Presidency at that time. Party of the people indeed. 😂Younger generations are getting screwed. They are the ones who need to step up and vote. Unfortunately they are not stepping up to the plate. And the politicians take note of these tendencies. So they will continue to get screwed.  \sNow is the time to VOTE.Please vote. Super Tuesday failed because young voters didn’t turnout to vote.Let’s vote everyone! I already paid off my student loans and I voted for Bernie. People should not have to go into debt more than the amount of our parents’ generation total first home cost to have opportunity.They finally have someone to vote for and they're letting this once in a lifetime chance go to waste due to pure laziness and apathy. I'm very frustrated.I wonder why this is? Is it the election vote process itself or something else?Gotta have some personal responsibility yes government policies can fucks u over but besides voting protests petition there is not a whole lot that be accomplished blaming others for your problems.\s\sWaiting for others to take action to change your situation is a losing battleOnly 13% of 18-29 year olds showed up at the polls but they represented **25%** of the votes cast yesterday. Now imagine if 50% of them showed up. Gen Y and Gen Z together make up halls the electorate. They have the power to decide the outcome of the primary and the general election... but they have to show up. \s\sYou know who shows up for every election? Boomers and people even older than them. Millennials need to decide to participate or decide to stop complaining about the older generations having all the power.\s\s\sEdit: apparently I misheard the report and had my numbers out of order. See this comment below:\s\s\shttps://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/fdp5da/joe_biden_passed_the_bill_that_made_student_loans/fjjedzd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\s\sAlso: millennials are not 18-29 I should say Gen Y.I wasn't educated in politics at 18 and regret it now. There never was an incentive as I felt it did not effect me. That seems to be the case with a lot of people in that age group either powerless or only know the common sound bytes of Democrats=snowflake and Republicans=Family valuesHonestly it’s not going to happen.  Super Tuesday showed me that.  Trump is president and still that wasn’t enough motivation to come out and vote.  I’m 35 now and remember not voting in a primary until Obama first term.  I also remember being super self absorbed but not recognizing it.  They’re not going to come out.  We are done.Cool calm collected Bernie is one of the most engaging people I’ve ever heard speak. He’s passionate about things but the way he simply says what he thinks of something and let’s you decide if it’s right or wrong is greatZoomers: that's my boy.\s\sElection day: Nah. I'm not feeling it.I love Bernie man. I'm so down right now. But the fact that he has been going for over 4 decades and has no doubt had plenty of shitty nights and still got here. Still won Cali and still in this bitch is inspiring as fuck. Ima donate my beer money for this week and just go to bed early lol. Night everyone.We have to reach younger voters to actually vote. That’s the biggest problem imoI was feeling down as well but your comment is what I needed to stay in this fight. I've maxed out my donation for Bernie tonight.If Tuesday was a failure then so was Thermopylae.I’d love for him to return to JRE podcast to make the case against Biden. We could really use a huge moment like that.True he needs more visibilitylol.  Yah because the people he needs to support him are surely tuning into the rogan podcast.I have around 100k in debt. In hindsight I should have at least tried a public option to make it cheaper but damnit I wouldn't trade the education I got for anything. I'm just upset that I can't save money or start a family because of it.When I was a young man in the early 80's you could still make a living on a 40hr minimum wage ($3.35).  We have to make it easier on our young people.Similar boat. $150k software engineering degree.\s\sWouldn't be a huge problem but now I'm on disability for health reasons (obviously?) and I lost my health insurance because of said disability.. and I can't afford any of the options available to me - none are free and the disability check barely covers basic needs.\s\sI need Bernie. If he doesn't win my options are: Leave the country for a cheaper one with better healthcare and just let the loans default or die.What degree?As an educator aren’t you eligible for relief from school loans?[deleted][deleted]I feel ya I had $140000 and was paying like $1400 a month. Makes me wanna go play in traffic.Honest question and up for discussion I'm not trying to attack. \s\sWhy should it be someone else's responsiblity for a loan you took out to fund your education?\s\sI graduated last year but I have no student debt because I worked hard to get a great scholarship chose to go to a cheaper college worked hard during college to fund my education and living expense while my peers were partying and finally chose a well paying major.\s\s Of course I had passion for another major but it would have costed me 150k in debt by the time I graduated. Of course I wanted to party all the time but I didn't. I made smart choices and sacrafices.\s\sWith student debt forgiveness it feels like a punch to someone like me who made key sacrafices and made smarter choices.\s\sI'm up for making education cheaper educating the public about cheaper options and also making it easier for paying student debt but an outright forgiveness seems very excessive.Full video?https://youtu.be/Y6I0e4EVwL0\s\s480p but better than nothing.\s\sEdit: reupload linkIt was live they havent uploaded it yet.Gotta get out and vote for US to win. Cast your ballot for Bernie! Go Bernie Go!!Everyone who is a college student or graduated college should be voting for Sanders. It's literally the person trying to get rid of your debt vs the person who caused it.Hell I'm voting fort Sanders because I want to go to college and I can't afford it.I mean... I did cause my debt but at the lowest possible way. Only graduated with $27K and paid it off in less than a year for a computer science degree.I’m a young voter (21) and ever since i found out about Bernie I’ve been telling people about him and how he’s the only one who is running that will make a change because it’s not just for him it’s for all of us. I’ve gotten a most of my friends and family ready to vote in philly the first second we can because we believe in himIf I posted something or made a meme or wrote something or did anything like that and sent it to everyone I know 0 young American voters would see it. Use your social networks spread the passionSenator Sanders is the only option. The time is now.The uncle we all want vs the uncle everyone is embarrassed ofThe time is now.Bernie did great. Maddow is clearly bought and paid for by the MSM/corporate America and she was asking pointed questions trying to throw Bernie off. He held his own very well and this is a great example of that.If Biden and Warren got interviewed like Sanders and Gabbard they wouldn't have lasted a month in this election. 2 mins in the interviewer would be like ""so why are you such a fucking liar anyways?""All for the criticism of MSM’s bias against Bernie but Maddow expressed admiration for Bernie in the interview and was clearly bought into his vision and platform.She’s getting 7+ million a year. Like everyone in the corporate media she has no interest in rocking the boat. Everything she says is approved by her producers who run it by the billionaire ownership for approval. There is no grand conspiracy in this it’s how every corporation runs the executive council sets the expectations and goals for their employees. Do we think Comcast is interested in paying more in taxes? What expectations are being set for their talking heads then.Asking pointed questions is the signal of a bad journalist now? What the fuck.In fairness to Joe I’m sure he doesn’t remember doing any of those things.Shiiiieeet homeboy was probably too busy cashing checks to read them bills \s\sAin't nobody got time for that when you're living that high lifeI get that you're joking due to everyone lately calling into question his mental stability but this line of reasoning seems dangerous.\s\sWhether he remembers or not - his record is his record. What isn't needed is ""fairness to Joe"" unless he can come up with a substantially good reason for why he voted the way he did on various bills.\s\sNot that you are claiming as much but I could see many people interpreting this the wrong way. Though more likely in the sense of ""Bernie supporters are all sarcastically insulting people"" rather than in the sense of ""in all fairness to Joe"".Biden has no plan his people have no plan. I'm listening to people talk and they're making plans to call trump a liar and a hypocrite when he attacks Hunter. I'm like guys that's never worked please listen. They're confident the anti-trump vote is enough.\s\sThis is so bad. Biden is like the dog chasing the car and now he's caught the car and doesn't know what to do.To be fair though HE'S BEEN REALLY GREAT FOR BANKS!Actually go vote age 18-29When did the air? I thought we were boycotting msnbc lol. Did u see the fox news article where they have video of Bernie watching fox for the results instead of CNN of msnbc cuz of how they've been treating him. Also said in the article he got in a big verbal arguement with president of msnbc. Said he walked right up to the office and started yelling at the guy. Granted it was fox news but i could definitely see it happening. I hope it's true cuz Im sure we all wanna scream at msm right now on his behalf  so the fact he actually did it is awesome.[deleted]https://youtu.be/GvVdHen-Izw\s\sFull interview.Too bad the people without student loan debt showed up to vote while those with debt or are acquiring debt right now failed to show up and vote.Status Quo Joe""Nothing will fundamentally change."" ~ Joe Biden\s\sThe same Joe Biden who was Vice President to ""Change you can believe in"" Barack Obama.Young people need to fucking vote. Seriously! Go and vote!Let's help them vote!He’s not THE reason but he’s certainly part of the problem.[deleted]> According to George Packer in his book The Unwinding Joe Biden Chris Dodd and Hillary Clinton helped pass this bill.[17] (Of the three however only Biden voted for the final bill. Dodd voted against and Clinton did not vote.[18])\s\s-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_Abuse_Prevention_and_Consumer_Protection_Act\s\sToo bad Warren never called Joe out on this because she was the bill's intellectual nemesis back in the 2000s and Joe was the most senior Dem advocate. Politics is a hell of a drug.Hit him where it hurts the most. Expose his records request a dementia test  and make everyone feel that Biden is not electable.Dementia test? Don’t get me wrong but Bernie is older than Biden and that’s enough to guarantee that would do nothing beyond causing an absolute TV Media shitshowAt this point people know the deal. \s\sGet used to the fact that _they just dont care_\s\sfocus more on mobilizing the people who did not vote that means everyone gets out of the house and talks to people\s\s4 hour wait to vote vs another 4 years of Trump and ripple effects that last another 40 yearsHit him hard BernieAnd Joe Biden is gonna be the reason dems lose in 2020.Yup. But they won't take responsibility for it.Biden offers NOTHING!!! For the country for the planet - it’s gotta be Bernie!! 👍Holy shit I had no idea. This fucking prick has ruined so many lives. Anyone who votes for him obviously has hatred in their hearts for Americans. If Biden gets the nomination I'm staying home in November. No doubt about it.Ah Americans believing in the same political BS **over and over again every 4 years**\s\sFor god sake vote for Bernie.But are yall voting tho?This man is spitting fire from when I watched the show tonight. Biden is going to have to find a way to back up his credibility otherwise the Establishment is going to lose their nomination regardless of how many stories they try to prop him up with; in fact I bet by the time the Debate Stage comes up on the 15th Biden may self-destruct himself given his incoherent way of speaking.I have to think that there’s gonna be people who are going to regret their vote for biden after seeing the future debates between bernie and bidenWhen you don't show up to vote you can NOT blame Joe Biden. No more blaming others. No more OK Boomer memes. It's on you and only you.While I’m all for taking personal responsibility chances are the ‘you’ you’re talking about isn’t who’s going to be reading your comment on Reddit in the first place.Whoa whoa whoa I'm voting Sanders but are you seriously blaming the 2008 housing market crash on the not yet vp at that time? What are you talking about? I want receipts pleaseBernie in the clip is referring to [BAPCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_Abuse_Prevention_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) which Biden not only voted for but actively campaigned and marshaled votes for it.  Among other things it made student loans virtually impossible to discharge which predictably fueled tuition hikes.  OP's title is a reference to the fact that thanks to this high inescapable debt load many are unable to buy houses since money that could've been spent on a downpayment and a mortgage (as was the case with previous generations) is now being sucked into a trillion dollar black hole of inflated tuition and endless loan payments.\s\sIf you'd like more info just let me know!I feel the Bern intensely but.... Saying Joe Biden is the scapegoat for all these things is the type of finger pointing that doesn’t help anything. \s\sIt’s more like Joe Biden has been complicit in perpetuating status quo policies and clearly doesn’t have the strength or conviction required to change these things. This just sounds a bit childishHow is what you suggested to say much different in substance than what Bernie said? Contrasting their voting records on a bill that as you put it ""perpetuated status quo policies"" is exactly what he did in this clip.I may have just convinced my very apathetic friend and his wife to vote for Bernie. They both have just way too much student loan debt for trying to become doctors and not quite making it. It really saddens me to see them struggle. I laid out Bernie's plan how he would pay for it etc. I sent them directions to nearest early voting location and said there's literally nothing else in this world that will give you a better potential return than spending 30 minutes and voting for Bernie.\s\sLETS DO THIS!It literally doesn't matter because young people don't vote...A vote for Biden is a vote for Donald Trump. People are tired of establishment politics and running one tired politician against someone who has somewhat turned politics on its head (whether you like him or not) is a foolish idea. The only way to encourage younger people to vote is to offer them a radical change. Running 💩 against 💩 is not how you get people to vote.For anyone interested debt is at its cheapest in a long time here but student loan interest rates are still high up to 4x(!!) higher than the market rate. Why is that? Why isnt it moving lower allowing students to get loans for cheaper and save tons of money? Turns out congress has control over what rates student loans are because they guarantee them giving the full confidence of the US government to the bank writing the loan and confirming they will not suffer default (this is also what locks you in to student loans through life and death). \s\sThey are supposed to update the rate every two years to mirror the market rate but they *just dont*. Simple fix to a simple problem yet completely ignored by every candidate or person in congress at all apparently. So seeing bernie say stuff like this all the time makes me wonder why hes passing up the layup to go for the expensive as fuck full court shotGenuinely curious and don’t want to be screamed at..  I grew up super poor in a trailer park on the outskirts of Houston and college was never even an option. No future. I did manual labor as a mover for a few years after high school and eventually started my own company with money I had saved. Now I’m in my 30’s and it’s doing really well. I make an upper middle class living. Life was definitely hard coming up but I never thought about taking a loan I couldn’t repay or needing anything from anyone else. My siblings all went to college but they paid for it with a combination of scholarships work and student loans which they paid off. I guess my curiosity is; 99% of the people upset about student loans are from life situations waaaay better than me and my family were in. It seems like a lot of the borrowing was for frivolous unnecessary education that hasn’t turned into any kind of real career. Why should it be free? I get that the lending may have been predatory in nature and you were young. But it costs money to operate a college professors janitors building costs all have to be paid. I guess it’s just strange to me that a bunch of (mostly) upper middle class  (mostly) white dudes are all really upset about poor choices they made as young adults and want those of us who actually work (really hard) for a living to foot the bill? Any non super angry thoughts on my question would be appreciated.I am unemployed on disability so I don't have much spending money. But today I made my first political donation ever to our boy.  $20 isn't going to go far buts what I can do right now.And the gloves are OFF!Is biden the reason none of you voted?Get his ass grandpaHit Joe hard plz[deleted]Now watch Joe find a reason to retreat back into ignorant nostalgia wave~\s\sI am glad Bernie is finally playing more hardball and on our end we need to if feasible engage the issues either in response or initiative rather than stay in our bubbles.\s\sNow is no time for polite consideration more effective climate change mitigation may hinge on American influence... though I would hope the world could move faster despite America's hindrence.\s\sAnother ray of hope amid the chaos is the sea change disruption of technology and relatively linear innovation that Tesla is taking us all through whether realized or not. More green and sustainable energy disproportionately combats Humanity's self destructive habbits.So what your saying is he's set it up so that the people who need to go out to vote to change this can't go to to vote because they can't risk losing their overworking minimum wage jobs.\s\sCause that sounds about right at this point.So... if Biden wins primary you guys won't vote for him in the general election?If that happened I would probably write-in Andrew Yang and start planning for 2024.Yeah this happened in 2016 too the bernie bros didn't get their perfect candidate so they didn't vote or voted Stein or voted fucking Harambe.Reddit like Bernie Sanders. We have to get out and reach audiences that are not in our own echo chamber.Minnesota you fucking morons.This is what we want!!!!My grandmother died in shame in debt up to her eyeballs. \s\sShe was pretty poor after divorcing her abusive husband. She was bombarded with predatory pre-approved credit cards in the mail everyday. Eventually she was financially desperate enough that she fell for the constant temptation (probably as a means to get her grandchildren gifts for christmas. She was always particularly embarrassed around christmas). \s\sOnce they had her they wouldn't let her go. Her last years was a constant deluge of threatening letters phone calls and exponentially inflating credit card debt not due to continued spending but because of all the ridiculous made up fees constantly being added on. She died a shell of her former self despite being in relatively good health.\s\sI'm confident that the companies that did this to my grandmother were emboldened by Biden's anti-working class anti-consumer pro-corporate bills that removed protections for citizens from predatory lenders. \s\sI'd bet that most working class families have stories of family members who were similarly targeted by predatory lenders and were destroyed by the lack of legal recourse.\s\sIf the media had done their job to expose this problem a Biden candidacy would be unthinkable if not laughable. The guy is the grim reaper of the working class.\s\sIt's not just young people who Biden screwed over.Don't look at Biden's support for the credit card companies.  You'll just get more upset.Maybe the problem is the student loans.I didn’t vote for Hillary in 2016; I won’t vote for Biden in 2020. \s\sBiden=Trump the same shit.\s\sDNC wants Trump to win again?\s\sSMHThis is sitting at the top of r/all and I'm afraid were preaching to the choir on Reddit. Repost this on other social media to hopefully make a difference.So go and vote youngsters!The more I research Biden the more I’m disgusted. His platform is eerily similar to Trump’s.As a Yang Gang member watching what they are doing to Bernie. I’m onboard to support the movement 🧢🇺🇸Hammer this. Young people need to wake the fuck up and get out to vote. Drag your friends to the ballot box if you have to.PreachI hear you but he has all those endorsements! How can all those people not have my best interests in their hearts? /sMerican friends honestly if you don't vote for this man... You are an idiot.Bigot Biden will reinforce the stranglehold of large comglomerates on your lives smothering your potential. America wake up!Yes and people need to vote!!!!!We need to hammer the message to boomers that Joe Biden is unelectable with his record.Warren should drop out and support sandersSo what would you do if it was Biden vs Trump?please winFucking vote people! We don't need Bernie keyboard warriors we need voters! Turn out on Tuesday for young people was patheticand farmers get a free ride.Joe Biden also has dementia. How the fuck did this guy get so much support?I hate to use this cliche but... THIS. So much fucking THIS.Then fucking show up at the ballot box. You have no one to blame but yourselves if you don’t get out there and vote.Guys! Remember to vote! I’m not American just want to wish you good luck. And YOUR VOTE MATTERS! You matter!Yes. Blame one man and one man only for all the bad in the US. I hate Biden but get real.Young people love his leg hair in the pool though. Smell my hair again grandaddy.Joe Biden killed your family. Joe Biden hates  jews. Joe Biden is literally satanI mean he is a pretty terrible choice if you just watch a few videos of him speaking.Joe Biden signed your student loans in your name?Man I got a house loan and living in my house but the government is the reason I owe money...No1 forced you to get student loans pay up.I'll be voting Bernie in the general one way or the other. If he's the nom or if he's a write in.Instead of paying off student loans you will just be paying higher taxes. Good luck with that.What about personal accountability? How can it be anybody else's fault but your own that you don't have a family and a house? I'm young(33) I accept my responsibilities and don't blame people for my life.Yes so vote trumpYOU borrowed the money. YOU pay it back  IDIOT.Maybe if we're going to keep having the tradition of picking a VP who is more conservative in order to appeal to Republicans we should stop having the tradition of that VP then running for president.Clyburn kept pushing for the whole ""return to normalcy"" bit. Whose normalcy?Put them on a stage together. Bernie would destroy this asswipeYou know who put Biden where he is?  Baby Boomers.Young people must come out to vote. They complain about things then act angry when no one talks about fixing their issues forgetting that no one panders to people who don't vote. Sanders is an exception that can see the future problems and is thinking strategically yet they don't vote for him (or anyone else).\s\sGo vote or be suck with a worsening life.Joe Biden is a conservative.Not true. You took out the loan in good faith that you will pay it back in full. Not  his fault you went to school and can't get a 6 figure salary. I'm one of the people that went and has been paying on time and I don't have a 6 figure salary. Stop blaming others for your problem.This bill is not the reason for the issues you mentioned.  The original cost of higher education is the problem.  How we deal with that debt is a fallout from the problem.\s\sDon't over exaggerate or mislead from the real problem.Yeah too bad the young voters didn’t come out. How are we going to beat this goof when we can even mobilize?! Go out and vote!Joe Biden pushes for the war in Iraq. A war based on lies that is responsible for the death of thousands of innocent people. How many families has this guy ruined?!? How can we look at his history and vote for him?If Biden wins the nomination it's 2016 all over again.  Democrat leaders don't care Trump is good for rich people.[removed][removed]What’s Biden’s position on M4A? Just more of the same?\s\sPeople need to realise Medicare doesn’t equal socialism and the system actually works quite well.Joe Biden is a creepy pedo who sniffs little girlsNeoLiberal. Joe Biden is what republicans used to be Trump is a fascist see where I’m going?  The scale has shifted.   Bernie is the actual democrat.  Don’t sip the koolaid people. Help yourself out!  Vote Sanders.Already did🤠That’s why it’s better to make college free like it’s free* to go to high school. So what if banks pull out the student loan industry as that will be a good thing for kids who would have taken out thousands of dollars in loans for a degree that won’t pay enough to pay the loan back. \s\sYou point would be moot if college was subsidized by the government. So you’re incorrect and it’ll be a positive outcome in society the day banks step away from student loans. \s\s/r/politicalVideo can suck it!If student loan is almost equal to  house loan then it's  tyranny to mealmost like a sandwich clamped by two generation's debt and housing mortgageand health care depends on  expensive insure is another.These are somethings that I can't understand about.They shouldn’t exist. Despite the “nobody is forcing you” argument. They should not exist and the issue is that they do. I’m sorry that you’re incapable of logic.All These  pro DeVos comments are beyond disgusting.  Only use for them is showing them to someone who ingested toxin and needs to 🤮\s\sWhen we finally get universial healthcare which you idiots are blocking because you hate students. I hope y'all get treatment for your intense pathology\s\sBtw if you think your hateful trash will help Biden (if dnc does select him) get any progressives on your side  your in for a surprise in the fallRemember none of this means a damn thing if you don’t vote. Go before or after work take the day off. Once you are in line to vote you can not be asked to leave. So far it’s only been about 13 percent of the youth vote for Sanders. That has to improve. If Biden wins Michigan handily it’s basically game over for Sanders.[removed]You need to get out of the Reddit echo chamber.   The silent majority of Democrats is far more centrist than Bernie Ocasio-Cortez etc.  We would all like free shit.  But mature voters understand that checks need to be cashed and credit cards have balances and bills.   Biden isn't th by enemy.  Ignore the uninformed and the Russian bots.  Trump fears Biden and only Biden.  Th hats the reason he pput a hit out on Hunter Biden.  There's a reason For that.The majority of Americans need to get out of their own shitty echo chamber and realise that going bankrupt cause of medical bills is fucking barbaric.Haha good one.[deleted]Joe Biden ate the last eggo waffle  in the Freezer. Joe Biden is the reason I never learned personal responsibility.Titles like these and this kind of dramatic over the top desperate attacks are a good way to alienate voters you will need if you win the primary. \s\sBut hey if you didn't want to learn your lesson from what happened with Pete or Amy why change your tune now.Probably going to get downvoted to hell for this. \s\sSeems like the US has decided to lean heavily towards Biden. And now Sanders is helping Trump by dragging Biden’s name through the mud the same way that he did in 2016 for Clinton. I’m starting to believe more and more that Sanders is the reason we now have Trump as our president and why his odds are increasing in 2020. \s\sTo me Sanders is looking out for himself more than he is for this country. If he cared about the country he would find a way to use his influence to work with Biden to ensure there’s a progressive plan moving forward. Instead he’s splitting the left more. \s\sFor full transparency I’m a Warren supporter who will support Biden over Sanders whenever she drops out.He’s been getting dragged through the mud for 5 years. Every other candidate attacks him. He brings up legitimate events where Biden helped to make the US citizens indebted literally and figuratively to the government with no real benefit to the individuals. \sIt’s not dragging him through the mud. These are real positions he held and laws he fought for. It’s called policy.\sWarren fought against the SAME policies Biden specifically helped pass while being a senior member of the democratic senate.\sIf policy matters Biden shares much less in common with Warren than you may realize.No. You are. Youre not entitled to a college education for free. You chose to get into debt to go to college. You were conned and now you want everyone else to bail you out of your mistake. Why are your problems never your fault and always someone else's? Take some responsibility for a change!I secured scholarships for my loan and got a useful degree. If debt is forgiven than prices for things like homes will sky rocket. It will be harder for me to get a house because of irresponsible Bernie Bros.[deleted]This is too reasonable.Pro Tip.  Young people can't vote against you if you made sure they were never born. *taps temple*I love Bernie but if Biden wins this infighting is going to almost guarantee a Republican win.Im curious why should I vote for Bernie? Im not looking to argue and have no real opinion or idea on who to vote for. What is it that bernie will do that will help America and me as a whole? Im here to listen reddit.Joe Biden is why your pp is smolAnd Bernie Sander's is the reason you'll struggle to maintain a home in the future or reach the next tax bracket. Don't pay for an education that won't give back to the community and you'll be fine. Our system is far from perfect but forcing everyone else to pay off your philosophy degree and social classes isn't the solution. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sTry to think of someone besides yourself in a time other than the present.We've reached the point in the primary cycle where shortsighted Sanders supporters team up with gleeful Trump supporters to endlessly bash the likely democratic nominee for months leading up to election day handing victory to republicans yet again.\s\sReal smart.Republicans overdrive the economy into a crash. Democrats work on fixing it but don’t get far quickly. Instead of doing the same process many of us would like to try a more progressive and generally different approach to empower citizen and address issues that frankly isnt being provided by either the Democratic or Republican Party.Magnificent aren't they?Ah yes the prevalence of poverty is predicated on Joe Biden's existence not hundreds of years unethical behaviour by corporate leaders and the American government!\s\sThese egregious misrepresentations of reality are the fuel for the perfervid animosity towards the characteristically ignorant ""bernie bros"".\s\sAs Individuals who condemn fake and misleading news you guys sure play a significant role in perpetuating it!\s\s&#x200B;\s\sEDIT: Thank you so much for the silver! This is the first time anything I've said has achieved such appreciation!Ahah im from europe we have healthcare and free universities but the young middle class still can't afford a home.\s\sSo yeah seeing that in one night joe biden is singlehandledly responsible for all that is pretty funny :DFor real holy fuck.\s\s""If it weren't for Joe Biden I would've declared bankruptcy to get out of my student loans and then it'd be easy for me to buy a house... somehow. Also Joe Biden determines what my employer pays me as he personally drew up my employment contract and forced me to agree to it under threat of castration which is why I can't have a family.""Yeah fuck taking responsibility for the consequences of your own choices as an adult!bernie needs to go on the offensiveHe’s also a huge reason we’re at war in the Middle East.Joe Biden signed you up for college. Joe Biden took out all your loans. Joe Biden makes you live outside your means. Grow up.WTF joe Biden literally made me enroll in a women’s study degree that cost $40000+ and now I can’t find a job. Why would he do this to me? I didn’t even do anything to him!!!!Also people don’t seem to realize that the fact that you can’t declare bankruptcy to get out of student loans is why anyone can get them and the interest rate is low.  \s\s18 year old students with no credit no job and no collateral would otherwise be paying super high interest rates or even get denied.[removed][removed][deleted]lmao actual animosity this will kill Bernie's runNo it wont[removed]My mom is always pestering me about grandkids I try and tell her about Biden but she refuses to listen[deleted][removed]Nevermind that the post is wrong Joe Biden is also going to be the only real alternative to Trump so...“Joe Biden is the reason I took out loans”Joe Biden really forced you into taking on all those student loans huh?Yeah cause I'm sure Biden made you take huge loans. Just LMAOJoe Biden poisoned our water supply burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses!I love Bernie but he’s totally wrong on this issue. Biden isn’t the reason millennials can’t afford houses. It’s their own fault for taking loans they couldn’t afford to pay back. I hope to see free public university in the near future but repealing student loans is a bad idea.Lol imagine blaming Joe Biden for you student loansYes. Blame joe for all your problems.You don’t have to *be* a student for this to benefit you. You don’t have to *have been* a student or even goddammit *know* a current or former student for this to benefit you. When our society is better educated we all rise.What the hell is this title? Might as well have been the_donaldNo that’s because you majored in EnglishNo. You're the ones who took out the loans you fucking idiots. How do you not realize that you are the rich people you hate so much. And you still want more. The irony is maddening.People are outraged because of this 'bill' but nobody forced you to attend college. Its actually a great idea contrary to popular belief to hold people accountable for their choices in life.While it would be nice for my student loans to go away can someone explain something to me. I get college is entirely too expensive. I get it's asinine to have to go into that much debt to start your life but really how can we say that we deserve to have it all cancelled? Didnt we agree to those loans? Aren't we responsible? Serious question.No it’s your fault for taking a loan that you can’t pay back Biden didn’t force anyone to take the loans.Joe Biden didn’t force you to take out the loans.  You have to sign a lot of paperwork that shows you understand how the loans work before they disburse so you knew you’d have to pay them back. No you are the sole purpose of your problems. You created your own problem. You pay your debts.[deleted]This is the type of “fuck you” attitude that fucks the country as a whole. Literally nothing changes or gets done because enough people feel like XY or Z does not impact them directly so fuck it — nobody should benefit. \s\sThe point isn’t to go back in time and right every wrong. Some people won’t benefit directly from some policies. And that’s ok. Everyone will benefit indirectly. Own a business? People will have more money to spend at it. Own rental property? People will afford it to rent it. There will be fewer bankruptcies more people starting businesses more people starting families. If the economy grows you grow. I rising tide lifts all boats. \s\sI had about $20000 in student loans. I’m down to $3600. By the time anything would be done about student loan debt my bill will be paid off in full. I do not expect a dime retroactively I do not expect pity and do not expect those with large amounts of student loans to desire anything else. This policy will not impact me at all directly. I’m still 100% for it. \s\sI also have 100% paid for company health insurance. I have to pay deductibles but monthly I pay nothing. I’m in favor of M4A even though I already have solid coverage. \s\sThe United States needs to put a fucking end to the “piss off” attitude of individualism. It’s about damn time that we all stepped up to ensure better lives for each other.[removed][removed][removed][removed]a vote for joe biden is a vote for trump.\s\smore of the same.Joe Biden murdered my family. Also he used all the ice cubes and didn't refill the tray.This sounds crazy. A tiny step in a progressive direction is 1000x better than a giant leap toward whatever the fuck Trump is up to.Completely agree. Biden will not be getting my support under any circumstances[removed]Im so sick of people dismissing bernie because of “mean bernie bros.” Like out of the millions of people in this country you cant get over a few people you encountered online that bernie isnt associated with whatsoever? Not to mention that every candidate has supporters who are rude online. For me personally i see way more rudeness coming from other candidates’ supporters but i dont hold it against their candidate because im not a crazy person. This narrative is just getting out of control.The ppl it impacts don't give a shit enough to vote...I wish he would have said in the clip exactly what the title of this post is. He needs to start going IN on Biden in the way that this titles does.I made a thing\s\shttps://imgur.com/a/N2z0VrhNot a sanders supporter **at all** - but I've always wondered. Why can't student loans be discharged in bankruptcy?Students have no equity so they'd just bankrupt themselves immediately upon graduation from university to discharge their loan.I don’t think this will pursued centrist. The only thing that will is showing them that Biden will lose to trump. It might not be the right tactic but it’s the correct tactic. People have shown that fear and ignorance are the strongest motivators.Older voters don't care about your student loans and only older voters vote apparently.Get him Bernie go for the fucking jugularu/vredditdownloaderTurn this party to the actual left or Bern it to the ground.\s\sVote Bernie no matter whoI mean I don’t want a family but my student loan debt is keeping me from going back and finishing my degree after my school (which is now being bought because it doesn’t have any money of its own because our head admin were terrible and are now being shamed by our senators for the state they left us) and teacher fucked me over.Yet young people won't go out and vote. There is no excuse not to voteWow. Long knives out for Biden. Sheesh!Why can't everyone sign up for early voting by mail in ballot? Makes the whole process so much easier!!!Bernie better be hammering points like this home in debates18% voter turnout from 18-29 year olds in California.\s\sLet's hope young people get out and vote in the remaining states.Can't wait to cast my vote for him in NY. I remember in 2016 I voted for him and when he lost in NY it was pretty much the nail in the coffin for him...I really hope this time is different.y'all really think the average democrat gives a shit? It's easy to talk about it it's a whole new thing to be about it.Please just actually vote people.Listen here's the thing.\s\sIf you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour in the Democrat party \s\s then you are the sucker.I'm picking who Russian doesnt like - BidenBy financial relief you mean file bankruptcy. Is that a precursor to having a family and buying a house?Lmao every single bit of the title is true but I got to tell ya.. don't use that family line lol\s\sAnyone halfway clever is going to turn that around on you regardless of its truth 🤣And yet when it comes down to Donald trump or Joe Biden even if you don’t like your democratic choice you should still vote Joe Biden. (Saying this as someone who voted for sanders)So go out and vote!Well then fuck that guy I want a house and a family yoYeah but not enough young people are voting so.....And Obama. Don’t forget.Ok but if none of us show up to the polls none of this shit fucking mattersWow just one guy?Cool go out and vote you fucks I see Bernie stuff posted all day talking about how hes pushing to change shit and yall do the same ol shit and sit at home not voting. I literally have never voted once in my life before and signed up to vote just because of Bernie this time. If you want change you have to be a part of it. Bernie cant win without you voting so stop talking about it and BE ABOUT IT.Isn't jke biden an extension of Obama and isn't this a roundabout way of saying. .. Thanks Obama?Annoying that this effect young people who don't go out there and vote. The older voters wouldnt really care and they are the ones that matterisn't it too late for sanders? I hope not but I think it isoh he's catching up!Let’s not forget Biden’s great idea of making schools “fun free zones”God I was so disappointed about the youth vote turnout! I'm only 15 but my brother was 18 and hes very political and he loves bernie but he didnt vote! I honestly have no clue what they're doing especially when they want to go into a high level PhD degree field like my brother and hes not fighting. This is why voting is so important so we can afford education into the so called ""real world"" as the older generation calls it to scare kids. I would like some insight as to why younger kids dont vote because in my school it is preached but no one ever seems to follow through with it.The name “Diamond” Joe is so fitting. Fucking worthless shit your parents bought into.He wont do shit when hes president just like trump. Hes just saying shit to get votesThe people this affected are not showing up to voting booths so how Biden doesn't give a shit.I never had debt relief.\s\sI own a few houses gave a family.\s\sOK- in all honesty I moved to Europe to live the American dream.... in socialist Norway but it CAN be done.I love how the lead-in gets specific and real. ""Joe Biden is the reason so many of us don't have families yet. Joe Biden is why we can't afford houses.""And let's be real here... We're Americans. We pride ourselves on bootrappiness. But at some point we have to realize that if a field of study is hot right now it might fizzle or get flooded in 4 to 6 years. \s\sGo to college for this but later on it don't mean shit. Add to that professions these days are so finite on details. It's nothing like what it used to be. Heck I got a buddy that got an English degree in the 90s. You know what he does? He's the IT manager in the healthcare industry. You know who can pull that off these days? Nobody. Literally nobody.\s\sIt's a different field out there now. Everything moves so fast and we're asking 18 y/o's to hit a bullseye on something 4 years down the road. If people could do that easily then wallstreet would be 4x richer.And this is how a republican wins. Because Democrats eat themselves alive and voter turnout is horrible lmaoSooooo this post is saying to vote for Trump? Because that’s only other option that exists.Imagine if Bernie works with Trump to make this happen\s\swhisper of a dreamRyan said he was working with Trump on wrapping up their plan so I don/t see it happening. It will probably be a high deductible HSA or something like that. It would guarantee a Trump re-election and Democrats would likely lose 2018 and 2020 on all levels of government. Considering we did that anyways why NOT give it a shot? :)That would be a triumph. There is a sense that ACA has gone so far that the only direction it can go is universal -> single payer.\s\sIf this happened this would most certainly be part of Obama's legacy.He later said a universal system wasn't possible in the US. Even Trump doesn't know what he's going to do.You know how much I would flip my Iid if he introduced universal health care. I mean the man is a idiot who has no rational grasp of foreign or domestic policies but if bernie who said he would work with him could oversee the plan i would be fully on board. He would in say to his voters  that he  ""killed obamacare"" but in actuality have given Americans the most progressive Healthcare program possible. This is the thing about Trump and it's why I'm not totally giving up on him.  No one knows what this guy is going to do not even Trump.  It's going to depend on what kind of day he's having and a lot of other factors but we have opportunities to get some good legislation through and we have a chance to get Bernie in 4 yrs.Look at his cabinet picks. Lines like this is how he manages to grab everyone's attention and have people go ""he can't possibly do that can he?"" \s\sWhile people are busy trying to decrypt statements like this thw big-money agenda keeps on truckin. Accept he never said Universal Healthcare and the title is wrong. It was just Trump being inarticulate like he always is.Hell Nixon tried to pass universal healthcare. It's good to consider the fact that Presidents think about more than their party. Look at Obama... he was a war machine because he felt he couldn't be this totally liberal guy. We should definitely try to look at policy and not just moan about Trump until he's out of office.I think he will do what the people want as long as we apply enough pressure. He's lying.If he focuses primarily on health care and the economy right off the bat that will be great. What is he actually saying?\s\sI heard ""private"" but also ""government will pay for it"" and ""people will go out and negotiate great plans with lots of companies.""\s\sHow does that all work together?Warren: this is what somebody with balls looks likeYep still wondering why she can't endorseWell warren is a femalegood interview;\s\shttp://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/congresswoman-endorses-bernie-sanders-steps-down-dnc-n527481\s\sWhat an intelligent likable woman!\sThis woman got the brain integrity and face.

Hateful or vague messages will not receive a response. **Please do not respond to this comment.**This man will always be the best America has to offerOnce again people and I can't stress this enough if there's an important issue past or present there's a video of Bernie coming down on the correct side of it.Bernie Sanders has been fighting for equality for the majority of his life. These bought and paid for politicians are scared shitless.\s\sBernie Sanders 2020The one he was facing off with here was later convicted of felonies for taking bribes from defense contractors.Duke Cunningham went on to bigger and better places. Namely uhhh prison for eight years.There are politicians who have stood by their beliefs even if such beliefs were unpopular for their entire careers.\s\sThere are others who have only stood by such beliefs once they became popular.\s\sPeople might say ""people's beliefs change"" but there is a clear distinction between having a genuine change of opinion versus changing your opinion because your party did.\s\sBernie has stood by his beliefs.So the bit about not diving into contaminated waters ... that happened to military folks and others a lot.  Water on military bases has been shown to be rediculously poisonous and 1995 is during the time the MCB Camp Lejeune  water cover-up was in full swing (50% on-base infant mortality rate seriously).  The Clean Water Act was and remains so ludicrously necessary for every day health and the only reason to oppose it is so corporations don't get held responsible for contaminating the countryside.\s\sAlso thank you Bernie gay people were and are serving honorably and it's grandstanding to make that a political football.\s\sEdit because downvotes: I'm thanking the Senator for sticking up for human (gay) rights and refusing to make it a political football like his opponents.   Also for sticking up for the CWA because my friends and I have been hurt by lack of oversight.""You don't have to be ""straight"" to defend your country.

He calls out corporations control over healthcare *and* talks about unionization as well. \s\sMore power to the people.AND the workers on set! LoLThis is the best fraiming i have seen. Yes corporations can take your Healthcare away…...His interview on Chapo a while ago was absolutely awesome. Highly recommended people check it out if they want more raw MM.Do you ever wonder why we get healthcare through our employer?  Do you ever think maybe that system is the government's fault?I get exactly what he is saying.. I just don’t necessarily agree with it.\s\sCorps control union health care? Far far far from it.\s\sPeople like union benefits because they are great — unions RARELY concede on this so how exactly does a corporation “take it” when they want? Oh CBA is coming up and we will cut it as soon as you strike.\s\sGreat move! Except you will have to retro cover everyone if you EVER expect to reach a new CBA deal.\s\sAgain the logic isn’t there.. I feel this can get past anyone who hasn’t worked directly with unions..\s\sAnd some of this big unions (UFCW IBEW ILWU) have self funded retiree plans. Just because you retire doesn’t mean you lose it. You pay a lower rate sometimes no rate on a retiree plan... and don’t forget those supplemental plans.\s\sUnions have it good don’t kid yourselves folks.. Corps are strong but they don’t just go and cut health care to flex while the CBA is active sure they’ll do it as a threat to ignite negotiations (during negotiation periods)..Reps the workers right there in the same room that’s so fucking tightikr the anchor was lookin a little nervous when he started pointing around the room*MSNBC didn’t like that*Thing of beauty that!Mike’s a production guy. He knows a lot of production employees are lifers. The loyalty some of these camera ops have to their station whether local or nationally is insane.They were all fired that night. Bet.T O I TSuch a smart move.Another reason this is a BS talking point is that it's specifically addressed in [Bernie's Workplace Democracy Plan.](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/workplace-democracy/)\s\sEmployers who have negotiated healthcare plans through their workers' union will be required to give employees pay increases or other benefits equivalent to the cost of the insurance.This is just MSNBC trying to get people to vote against Bernie by making it sound like ""oh if you're union and you have healthcare voting for Bernie will make you lose your healthcare""I did not know this but it's exactly what I've been arguing for in Tulsi's sub after hearing her talk about giving people a choice to keep their better union plans. Like hello they get Medicare 4 all their employer saves money so renegotiate the union contract and get more benefits.We need to get this higher upThisHoly shit I didn't know that. I'm not Union but our municipal run healthcare costs me $200/month. If I were paid that instead and got universal on top that'd add 12% to my net pay plus whatever I saved in taxes.>Employers who have negotiated healthcare plans through their workers' union will be required to give employees pay increases or other benefits equivalent to the cost of the insurance. \s\sBrb making a contribution to Sanders' campaign. And here I thought I couldn't be sold on him any harder.Is this just for unions? Or is it applicable to anyone who gets insurance through their employer?Oh wow I did not realize that was part of the plan. That's huge.My company pays $750/month for my insurance. Woooo I'd love to have that money in my pocket.I've been looking for this answer for a while. Thank you. \s\sThe specific question I've been asked is how retirees with penions that provide health insurance would be affected. Not to say that I thought they would lose coverage but it wasn't obvious if the value of their existing coverage would be effectively lost. This is the first evidence I've seen that the Sanders proposal acknowledges these issues and would empower labor unions to renegotiated those benefits. \s\sIf you have a minute to reply can you verify this is an accurate understanding of the proposal you linked?\s\sThanks so much for your diligence in this community. Know that you're making an impact with posts and replies like this. I will pass this information on and likely convert several voters from Pete to Bernie because of it.Take em to church Michael!\s\sThis was fantastic.That’s Michael‘s last time on MSNBC\sRipHope not. But he could be swimming with the fishes like Ben Jealous who has been Persona Non Grata since he did one panel after Bernie announced earlier this year and defended Bernie ably from the party line asininity that was being spewed by all the other panelists and hosts on MSNBC.I don't think they have a choice. He's a big draw for them. If they could have blackballed him they'd have done it ages ago.I think it's actually possible but not because he supports M4A or Bernie Sanders. Everyone already knew that about him.\s\sHowever talking about how their camera people are now non-union...yeah that might get him blackballed.Nope! They are playing his movie bowling for Columbine tomorrow and he is gonna talk again after it plays with a news dude that he also talked with last night.\s\s(After that though maybe but idk)Oh shit he said “Bernie Sanders” on MSNBC. You’re not allowed to say that word there.Bernie Sanders is like Voldemort to MSM.Who?Is it just me or is the msm bias a lot worse and more blatant this time around.before he was more of a nuisance to them but now with him knocking it out of the park all over the place with donor numbers positive views on Joe Rogan now the endorsement of most of the squad etc... they are in panic mode. They need to poison the Sanders brand so people will try not to be connected with it. I think this recent Hillary bash on Tulsi is part of that to get him to either be associated with the spooky Russians which gets their centralist base ginned up or to make  him look bad if he doesn't support Tulsi. In short they are getting desperate.Because before there was no chance of any of this actually passing. So they could talk freely and seem fair and unbiased. Now that it actually has a chance the M4A and Bernie bias is in full force.It was bad last time. MSM is less relevant this time fortunately.  So they are getting a bit panicky.It is hilarious to look at trump supporting boards talk about the bias against Trump. You fucking kidding me? The MSM absolutely NEEDS Trump to win. But they also just want to get money in the mean time by shitting on him. They know his loyalists ain’t changing their minds. \s\sFuck the MSM.MSNBC is owned by Comcast the more serious socialism is taken the further towards Rs they’ll go\s\sWashington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos they won’t endorse any candidate that plans on breaking up Amazon or that has a STOP BEZOS ACT\s\sGet prepared for MSM to turn to Rs for comfort from all the scary socialist this cyclehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGe6017JwPwLiberals are not and have never been on the side of democratic socialistsIt's always been.  \s\sPeople who get their news from a tv screen/talking head are barely people to me.  If they couldn't vote we'd be better offIt’s honestly been like this for decades. Remember the media during the Iraq War?msnbc is often worse than fox imo\sfox is an echo chamber but msnbc is corporate media that has the ear of left leaning citizensNot just you - Bernie is a threat to upturn the entire establishment.It was tremendously bad in 2016 too. It might just be the fact that all the stuff that happened 4 years ago is buried. Where are you going to hear anything about 2016 bias in elections? Now it’s just right in our face again to it seems more real./r/bernieblindnessOh boy that was great.Now that Bernie is getting some pretty well-known allies on board now I suspect it's going to get harder for the media to tell the false narratives of the evils of socialized medicine. The cat's outta the bag bitches!As much as the media tries it's not working.  A majority of Americans (including a majority of republicans) support Medicare for All.They just gonna keep ignoring his existencd thoughWatch her body language when asking. She knew her framing represents big corporation interests that hurt millions of peoples haelth and rips the rest of and make them dependent. Great answer from Michael he got it rightYup.  That defensive arm cross.  She knows she's setting him up with a bad faith question.Healthcare is a fight every contract in my union. Medicare for all is better than than any insurance a company can offer.Yep also they can change your healthcare any time they want and you lose your Doctor. My kid has gone through 3 doctors because of this. Everytime it's a nightmare finding a new one. \s\sAnd Doctor #4 she lost was because the doctor had a private practice and couldn't get the insurance companies to pay him and his wife enough to stay in business.everybody just LOVES their private insurance tho says the millionaire anchor on TV who will never have to worry about affording healthcare for them and their families for at least a few decades.Yes and this is something I wish Bernie would highlight more often. With private insurance you can lose the ability to see the doctor of your choice because:\s\s* you lose your job\s* you transition to part-time and lose benefits\s* your employer / union changes insurance plans\s* your insurance company changes who is in network\s* your doctor changes what insurance plans they accept\s\sWith M4A you just go where you want. Period.This talking point is the most egregious that they smear Bernie with. It's like if they said Bernie wants to take away your Ford Focus. How outrageous! They never mention he wants to replace it with a Cadillac.Here are other countries’ with single-payer healthcare and their satisfaction rates - https://twitter.com/mattecampbell/status/1185513534307950598?s=21Yes but all those countries are bankrupt now and all their wealthy business owners fled the country taking jobs with them.\s\sOh wait that isn't what happens? Oh....As someone who lives in New Zealand...NZ is not single payer at all. It has a public health system so if you can't afford private you can seek treatment there. However GPs (family doctor) are only subsidised for residents (still generally costs $55+ out of pocket) and there are plenty of private hospitals and specialists which are very costly. Does not make chronic conditions easy to deal with lemme tell ya. I still have health insurance through my work but if I leave to study etc. I will lose it. Generally wait times in the public system are long of you are not seriously ill. But at least it's there.\s\sI will say though that if you have any emergency you can just go straight to the hospital in a FREE ambulance and pay nothing. That is very comforting.Go Mike go.In the United States healthcare is a mechanism by which capital disciplines controls and manipulates the workforceSo the ""liberal FOX news"" is paring back union labor. Why am I not surprised?You mean MSNBC?I wish I could upvote this a million times. Michael Moore is back!! He gave an amazing answer to a ridiculous question.My grandma had great private health care and pension until the company ended up cutting it all and taking it away from her at 90 years old. At that age she was able to get Medicare and Social Security which admittedly wasn’t as good but it was something. I really felt bad for her. It’s messed up companies are allowed to do this.That was amazing.I am in a union.  My healthcare plan is horrible.All the more reason for Medicare for all.Fuckin right!!!The thing I find facinating about these TV or radio show is they never just go out on the street and ask people directly unless they know the answer would come out the way they wanted.  So you want to know how union people thinks go visit the sGM trike and visit the strikers.  They just won right ask them if this means they don't need M4A.Certainly not LIVE.They're going to fire those camera workers.Damn! That was an excellent answer. I wish he would have added that people can just get fired as well. Getting healthcare through private insurance is extremely unstable for several reasons.It's weird that ""the strongest and wealthiest"" country on Earth some how couldn't figure out how to do Government Healthcare.Could easily figure out how to. Already know how to. The parties who run the government are paid not to.Amazing job.Bernie needs to raise this point (by example) more clearly on the public stage.wow this is the best response I have heard so farGood ol American Greed is whyI would have gotten a great chuckle if the camera fixed on him started subtly nodding when he mentioned the once-unionized cameramen.*'The praxis WILL be televised.'* \s\sNicely done sir.I am in a union with great healthcare for my entire family and you know what?  My employer pays over $12/hr for it.  My employer doesnt care where the money goes once he pays it and it would be really nice with Medicare for all and  we can even split the difference of what my employer pays out. I would get a $6hr raise and my employer pays less.  My taxes can go up a little bit if I can get a $6hr raise who cares.[Check out Bernie's Workplace Democracy plan.](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/workplace-democracy/)\s\sLast bullet point.. that $12/hr should be yours. Bernie's fighting for you.Bless Michael Moore for speaking the truthAs a union member with free health care. I 100% am voting for Bernie Sanders. I want my fellow Americans to have the same opportunities I have. That is solidarity. Most of you may not know but when another union strikes say at a grocer we join their picket line we dont patronize those establishments because of solidarity. Power in numbers. Stand together thats how We win. Us not Me.This needs to be at the top. Good for you and your union. POWER IN NUMBERS!!!!It is beyond me why people advocate for a system that requires us to rely on our employers. You can't take your insurance with you when you leave that company people. Medicare-for-all means that regardless of where you work you have coverage the exact same coverage. Why don't people see the benefit of that?Michael Moore's speech was very good and his closing was excellent ... The preamble of the United States Constitution perfectly explains what the Sander's campaign is about ... ""We the People of the United States in Order to form a more perfect Union establish Justice insure domestic Tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""; https://constitutionus.com/Love you michael.  unions foreverHow do we make sure that the DNC and electoral college haven't already been corrupted or compromised?Damn! Mike ripping the MSNBC female anchor a new one and I love it!Nobody should be considered too poor to live.#BernieOrBust I hope the DNC is reading this message. Do right by him this time.Guess this is Michael Moore’s last visit to MSDNC?Help me out Medicare people:\s\sI have an aunt who says that rural hospitals will go bankrupt if Medicare for All reimbursement is in any fashion the same as how Medicare reimbursement is handled now. I've not heard this talking point myself. She used to work for a hospital and she's the only person I've heard talk about that particular caveat. \s\sIs there any part of the plan that discusses that?Most people counter that argument with the reduction in claims processing red tape. Hospitals burn a lot of resources just trying to get paid.That is not true. Most rural hospitals are propped up by government dollars because they serve less insured populations. They already are government funded...I too would like an answer for this. I live in a rural area and it would be a great talking point.Love this!I'm just 66 years old in my lifetime I will not see quality healthcare in the US.You're not just going to get it. We have to stand up and demand it.\s\sWe have to go out and fight for it.\s\sDon't just join the political revolution. Volunteer. [Canvass](https://map.berniesanders.com). [Phonebank](https://www.berniesanders.com/call).Well I guess he won't be invited back anytime soon.\s\sSchooled...I don't watch any cable news really but the more I see of MSNBC hosts the less I respect their network.Because Michael greed.It’s nuts to me but most Americans I’ve talked to have no clue that we’re the only first world country (to my knowledge) that doesn’t have universal healthcare.. it works for everyone that tries it.I'm not American but I'd be so happy if Bernie wins the election. Not only would it be great for Americans it would be great for the entire world.I help run a small business of 30. We provide health care to employees of all pay grades. It’s a huge expense but we happily pay it. However it’s become difficult to pick what healthcare to provide each year. We obviously want to give the best but have to weigh the pros and cons of each. It can be an ethical dilemma. \s\sMedicare for all would be a massive economic boom for our company and many like ours. Not paying for these premiums and allowing people to get the best care available would be such a win for the economy and for smaller business to allow us to be more competitive against larger companies. It would help us attract talent and keep them.  It would allow workers to be flexible with their employment and get rid of the #1 cause of bankruptcy in this country. This in turn would free up money for tons of people boosting the economy. \s\sI support Medicare for all because it’s the right thing to do for people and create an even stronger economy.Can we put this on YouTube so we get more people to watch this? It's very educational.I'm a capitalist among other things and dognabit universal healthcare would be extremely productive. When workers feel secure in health & healthcare coverage they are more productive. Small businesses that can't quite afford healthcare would be able to recruit great workers because healthcare benefits would not matter. People would quit shitty jobs. People would get jobs they actually liked. Businesses would get workers who actually fit or liked their roles. People would truely be free.\s\sI stayed in a miserable job for 12 years because I graduated college during the recession (07) and I was ""one of the lucky ones"" that landed a career with benefits. I regret the last 6 of those 12 years. My company was demanding things above and beyond more and more and I was performing but there never was any compensation come review time (.28 raises gee thanks). I stayed because healthcare. Healthcare that I am lucky enough not to need more than once a year but you never fucking know. I quit that 9 billion dollar company to go to a really really fucking small biz and I loooove it. My husband is able to provide me health care because my tiny businesses I run cannot afford it. I'm the COO of the tiniest (but growing thanks to me) empire. I was just another cog for the 9bn company and they could care less about anyone. \s\sIt's stupid to think we can go on any other way. Universal healthcare is the ONLY way forward.He needs to be this aggressive to melted brain establishment zombie Bill Maher.This whole ""Bernie is gonna take away your health insurance"" talking point is the most annoying bit of misinformation I've seen this election cycle.\s\sI'm a state employee working in education. The premiums for my (really really good) health insurance are paid 100% by my employer. But I'm still voting for Bernie because even with the awesome healthcare coverage I have his plan is *still* better.\s\sMy plan is not free at the point of service. His is.\sMy plan has a deductible. His doesn't.\sMy plan allows a private corporation the option to put their profits before my health. His doesn't.\s\sI dont care how good your health insurance is. Bernie's plan will cover you better and cost you less.\s\sAnd all the selfish reasons aside let's say I never use my free private health insurance and now suddenly I'm paying a little more in taxes. I'd STILL support Bernie and his plan because we live in a society where not everyone can afford the coverage they need and I can see past my own damn nose.\s\sIf the media made any attempt to be honest this talking point would never make it on air. It's sad that it has to be addressed but almost funny how flimsy it is.My room mates asked me why I wasn’t coming out of my room for a party and I told them I was listening to the sweet sounds of michael moore.🔥🤝 FRIENDS AMERICANS AND [SUPPORTERS ABROAD](https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/#Volunteer) 🤝🔥\s\sIf you seriously support Bernie *do not let this campaign pass without volunteering*. **It's the only way we win** and it's as easy & quick as you choose.\s\s* [General signup](https://act.berniesanders.com/signup/volunteer-bernie-sanders/) \- start here\s* [Local events map](https://map.berniesanders.com) \- canvasses phonebank & watch parties rallies\s* [BERN web](https://app.berniesanders.com) / [google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berniesanders&hl=en_US) / [apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bern-official-bernie-2020-app/id1474294851) app - canvassing & volunteer tool\s* [BerniePB](https://www.berniepb.com) \- phonebank leaderboards teams realtime map\s* [FeelTheBern.org](https://www.feelthebern.org) needs Spanish translation help!\s* [Learn how to register and vote](https://voteforbernie.org/) for Bernie **especially if you live in NY where you must register as a democrat before February**\s\sIf this comment leads you to sign up go to an event get BERN translate register etc. let me know in comment or DM – I’ve got to know that this is worth my time!\s  \s✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨I don’t get it this guy goes from suggesting only Michelle Obama or Oprah can win to actually speaking out for Bernie. How long until the networks axe him?Part of crafting a revolution is convincing people that you can win the fight. Michael has known Bernie as a fighter for a long time. And now he thinks we can win.I think suggesting that Michelle or Oprah can win is because of the celebrity culture in america. The implication is that most voters only vote for names they already know.This is unrelated but I was wondering if anyone knows: How does M4A effect military personnel?My understanding is that Bernie is going to keep VA benefits separate (and expand those as well)And with the Dubs hat! My man!Awesome.I think the most amazing part of this clip is that he was able to get that point across without being interrupted with dumb counterpoint.r/madladsWhen the Unions inspiration through the workers blood shal runWe live in the wealthiest nation in the world and there are some Americans who simply do not want that wealth working for all Americans.\s\sEvery other country has this and they pay less for more.  \s\sYet some Americans will argue until they are bankrupt and dead from cancer that we shouldn’t do it.  \s\s\sIf you’re arguing against universal healthcare you’re a fucking brainwashed monkey.  A stupid moronic brainwashed monkey; arguing for a broken system that the majority don’t want.  \s\sStop being that stupid fucking minority.I’m really impressed I always get frustrated when people who support M4A don’t do a good job of responding to this BS question. This is one of the most succinct responses I’ve seen about this minutes and perfectly dismantles the myth of people losing their “amazing private healthcare that they love”He answered this pretty well in my opinion. More of us need to say that the great health care we get from unions this shit can be taken away or lost when leaving the job. It doesn't stay with you! Bernie's M4A WILL stay with you be good comprehensive healthcare AND will give you the peace of mind that your covered in case you loose your job!Obama endorses Bernie. MSM reacts:\s\s""Does this endorsement really matter? I mean Obama did endorse Bernie back in 2006 so we did see this coming...""Her body language says it all. He powerfully rebuked a flawed argument with facts and tossed the premise in their face in a way that hit home hard.

A man tells truth on TV and backs it up with facts. Watch as the host is shocked that a man is not supporting propagandaI am a member of one of the biggest healthcare union in NYC I have unparalleled healthcare through the union. It’s untouchable by my employer. \s\sI want Medicare for all everyone I work for wants Medicare for all(excepting the red hat wearing ones). It’s better for everyone especially my patients. \s\sThe only argument I ever hear against MFALL is that in other countries they have a long wait. My answer to this is: go ahead call your doctor I’ll give you 1000 dollars if you can get a non-emergent appt for today.Watching laterAs someone deeply involved in healthcare I really want to hear whether there is a plan to ensure more of the Medicare payments go to the healthcare providers and less to the administrators and red tape pushing administrators.\s\sLook up the rise of healthcare administrators vs providers in the past 40 years.\s\sAlso in many practices Medicare/caid make up 60+% of patients but private insurance makes of 60+% of payments. Medicare for all would cripple many practices and hospitals if current fee schedules are used.\s\sPlease before Universal Healthcare is voted for have a team of competent practicing specialty and non-specialty physicians be a huge part of the process.This guy you believe? Its Michael Moore.its always adorable that when corporate media acts like they ACTUALLY CARE about union workers Considering most of the time they couldnt give a shit. Its a bullshit Talking point. Moore is 100% right in the fact that basically CEOs basically say fine....we will give you good healthcare but we are gonna not pay you as much.That bitch got owned. Good riddance to corporate demsbrutal. So happy Michael Moore's stepped up his game. The only people's opinions that should matter are those people who predicted Trump's victory.LOL at the framing.\s\sMSNBC: We corporations still deign to give union workers the crumbs of decent healthcare! How dare you ask them to throw all the charity we shower on them away just for universal coverage!\s\sMoore: LOL. You busted your unions a long time ago you fucking corporate establishment stooges!michael the gsw hat is fly as fuck as are unions and healthcare for all!!!!I’m predicting fewer MSNBC appearances in Michael Moors future unfortunately.Amazing !!! #Bernie is the only one who will pull through for working Americans. #OrganizerInChiefHey look guys neoliberal media found a new talking point so that they can shill for their rich bosses while still LARPing as ""left"".Everybody liked that.I like Micheal Moore and I'm pleased that he endorsed but i would have preferred Naomi Klein to speak at the rally.Not a fan of MM but he’s right.Michael Moore isn’t the best spokesperson to have on your side. I truly hope Sanders wins the Democrat nomination because he can beat Trump but Michael Moore is the lefts equivalent to Breitbart. Who really cares about what he says anyway. His help will only hurt the cause.Michael Moore tells the truth.  Would you like to know how I know that?  Because he said that he has the best libel lawyers that work for The New Yorker magazine go through his movies and books with a fine toothed comb to make sure that every word in them is truthful.  This is because truth is an absolute defense to libel and slander.  So yes Michael Moore tells the truth. Why you say ""his help will only hurt the cause"" I do not know.[deleted]Shoo.I understand what he's saying but I don't think putting Michael Moore as the spokesperson for liberalism is a good look...Well he's not really a liberal to begin with so yea I guess you could say that he isn't the best spokes person for liberalism[deleted]Because he made a hard hitting documentary a few years ago about how fucked up our healthcare system is. He's a leader in taking the problems with our society analyzing them and communicating them digestibly to the public. He's a guy you want on MSNBC talking about these things.Because he directs documentaries about capitalism the healthcare system and politics?\s\sHe's not directing superhero flicks. Love him or loathe him politics is an area where he's done a lot of research for his films.Has anybody here seen what healthcare looks like when it’s run by the government?  If not take a look at the Veterans Administration.  You want healthcare like that?  Disaster.[deleted]Thats what the establishment corporate media and politics both parties btw. make a lot of americans believe for decades now. I invite you to visit me in Germany paying 375 $/month for full coverage for a family of 4. Everything is covered and meets american standards for sure free choice of doctors hospitals etc.. Full Health care full dental health full mental health even alternative medicine. No out of pocket expenses. Ok plastic surgery i wouldhave to pay myself but thats not health care obv. \s\sIt works in every developed european country Canada Australia etc. Don\`t fool yourself[Seems to work for most of the rest of the world. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care?wprov=sfla1)Living abroad has opened my eyes to how ridiculously corrupt American healthcare is. So much money wasted on middle men.Why?Tell me friend why can Romania afford it but we cant? Are you saying we are more poor than Romania?Is he still a lifetime member of the NRA?Do you still beat your wife?\s \s/sMichael Moore is an obese lunatic. Canada is the only nation on earth that makes private healthcare illegal. Even Europe isn't dat crazy. It's just super inefficient.The text of the current Medicare For All bill [explicitly says  that it doesn't make private healthcare illegal.](https://fortune.com/2019/04/23/medicare-for-all-private-insurance/)Ha stupid fat man then I get to control what you eat and put you on a diet you will not have a choice! If my taxes pay for your healthcare fat people then I will force you to eat healthier!Ok fine then less refined sugar in the products in America vs most of the world. Let's do this  better and cheaper access to healty food alternatives subsidies to provide transport for ugly produce to food banks.Medicare part a alone takes 10 years or 40 quarters to qualify for. Part b then costs you $135.50 each month to pay for. You then need a supplement plan ($160-$300 per month) along with a part D or you get penalized for life. \s\sYea Medicare for all is BS isn’t going to happen and it’s not free. \s\sSorry to break your dreams of getting stuff handed to you for free.How's it work so well in other countries then? Surely if they can manage USA can? You're right it's not free but it's certainly cheaper.\s\sYou spend the most per capita for the worst outcome its unfathomable to me why you wouldn't want to switch to a more efficient more equal cheaper system that has been working internationally. If you don't care about your fellow man the do it for the sake of your hip pocket Scrooge.\s\shttps://www.businessinsider.com.au/cost-of-healthcare-countries-ranked-2019-3?r=US&IR=TOur current system called Medicare and the proposed system called Medicare For All are not the same plan. You are comparing apples to pineapples.\s\sAlso no claimed Medicare For All would be free so you are arguing into the void.Come on America you know it makes sense. This guy will actually serve YOU not the other way roundIt so obvious I feel like everyone knows it they just don't want to be shamed away from the big kids table of politicsProblem is they're so used to establishment corporate dick sucking politicians that when someone genuine comes along you think he's crazy/radical. Someone famous said something along those lines I can't remember who it was.BERNIE!!! God he still has so much fight in him!!! Donating now!!!I think most people are just worried that he won’t get anything passed due to republicans talking shit and obstructing 24/7. I just think that republicans are going to be assholes regardless and at least Bernie is trying to help unlike those other boring democrats that have no spine. Elizabeth Warren was pretty good too IMO.Everyone: I agree with Bernie and his ideas now. \s\sAlso Everyone: His ideas are too radical. \s\sMe: ????????????We need the Senate alsoI know! We need help over here.He’s visibly angry and I am too. I want him to represent me. I’m voting for him.I don't see how the American people cannot plainly see that but they can't. Propaganda is powerful and those behind it are really good at what they do and have really powerful tools at their disposal“But he’s yelling! I don’t like being yelled at!!”but... buttttt. buttttttt. he's a millionaireBernie burned his bridge to self-respecting voters when he bent over for Hillary in 2016. That's the real Bern that his supporters have to feel.""serve YOU"" by massively hiking your taxes and reducing your choices. Sounds like a great choice /sThat is up for debate. The less money you make the more he serves you. Raising my taxes banning my guns and banning my STANDARD capacity 30-round mags is not doing anything at all to serve me.LMAO at them trying to interrupt bernie right after he exposes them**BY. THE. WAY!**That’s gonna backfire on them massively. This is exactly why people love Bernie.Warren’s grin as Bernie keeps shouting is also fantastic!out of curiosity was it just coincidence and he really was out of time? or were they trying to shut him down? (i haven't watched the debate yet)This is like the #1 no-no in all broadcast media - you never say anything to piss off the sponsors.Exposes what? He was out of time. What does who bough ads on the show have anything to do with how CNN moderated the debate? Media companies segment their sales teams away from network talent teams.Bernie SMASHED CNN tonight\s\sCouldnt be happier with how this turned outOldest candidate out there was also the sharpest save for maybe EW.He smashed like Kai last night!You could almost feel the fear of tapper when he started talking about that lol. Bernie made them look like minions to the healthcare industry.> Bernie made them look like minions to the healthcare industry.\s\sWell it's easy to make an elephant look like an elephant.Love this!Another Georgian who supports Bernie? I'm not alone![deleted]Is that the time he was given? Did they cut his 30 secs?""LALALA DON'T LISTEN TO HIM WARREN SAY SOMETHING ELSE PLEASE""Why I think Bernie is the best choice is because he has appeal not only to democrats but also inexplicably some Trump-voting republicans. I think he’s not only the best choice from a consistently ethical statesperson standpoint but also because i believe he’s the only one who will literally demolish Trump.Trump's campaign in 2016 used some of Bernie's talking points against Hilary. Some voters that would have voted for Bernie heard those talking points and went along with Trump. They didn't see that Trump conned them. My glasses are a little rosey right now.It's not inexplicable not by a long shot.  Bernie offers objective material gains for working class people regardless of what they think.  It makes PERFECT sense that working class conservatives would be drawn to his policies.  \s\sClass is about property or the lack thereof not what someone thinks.Bernie has this magical superpower where he can get working class Republicans to see themselves as working class first and Republicans second. I've never seen it replicated by anyone else.> inexplicably some Trump-voting republicans\s\sNot that hard to explain in my opinion. People hate neo-lib politics. Obama kind of showed how empty even the most revolutionary version of neo-liberalism is and how it only makes things worse for everyone other than the tippy-top of society. People would rather have a positive change than a negative change but if that tippy-top cheats them out of the positive change they'll vote for the negative blow it all up change aka Trump.I played around with this while enlisted and surrounded by Trump supporters during the 2016 election. All it took was framing Bernie's positions in how it benefits them. I didn't even mention party affiliation considering everyone thought I was a Republican as well. Interesting to find that most people were socialists and all about helping people. Except the mexicans and arabs specifically.What do you mean by consistently ethical statesperson? Bernie has been voting like this for decades.i had a pretty shit day but this was an awesome way to end itGlad we could help :)Bernie with the right cross.... Liz getting giddy about it all. What a night! hahaI really hope to get to vote for these two as a ticket next NovemberGreat to see somebody passionately go in to bat for American workers.first read this as ""go in *with a* bat."" still fits i think lolCorporate democrats are just not racist republicans.  No middle ground.Corporate dems are Mitt Romney republicans bought by the the highest paying lobbyist.I wouldn't so far as to call them not-racist. There's no way Biden hasn't said the n-word under his breath on the train home after some kids try to dance to raise money for their school basketball team.They realised they were in trouble as soon as he said the word ""advertising."" Move to cut cut cut. That's exactly what they did to him earlier during an interview I remember something like this happening before.I sometimes do wonder if Sanders does win the nomination is CNN gonna end up backing Trump in order to appease their Big Pharma masters?You know they willNo doubtyesAll of the people that said ""Trump tells it like it is""... this is what ""telling it like it is"" *really* looks like.The people that say that think that saying nonsense racist and bigoted things is the same thing as “telling it like it is”.What was the question?""will you make middleclass people pay for this medicare plan by raising their taxes""Will your M4A plan raise middle class taxesHot fuckin damn!>	Senator Sanders thank you for your time. \s\sThat was irritating 😤 me more than it should. \s\sThe stage is crowded. Imagine one on one with that 🍊it's not a crowded stage that's making the host do that it's the host scared of Bernie convincing the public and trying to cut him off as much as he can so that he doesn't get a chance to have his sayLo e that the crowd literally laugh at that.So great how he called out CNN and their advertisers. I wasn't able to watch it on TV so I'm curious: cid the healthcare industry actually advertise like Bernie said?Top comment here:\shttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ck0ztg/sanders_clashes_with_tapper_your_question_is_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\s\sYes.Yes even before he said it. It was embarrassing really.SCREAM IT PAPA BI didn't watch the debate what was the question?""Will your healthcare plan RaiSe tAxEs oN tHe miDdLe cLaSs??""Brunch with Bernie after a few bloody Mary's.BY THE WAY  \s\*applause\*  \s*BY THE WAY*  \s\*still clapping\*  \s***BY THE WAY***  \s\*oh quick shut up he aint done\*WowThey cut him off so quick when he mentioned “advertisers”. ShamelessWarrens laugh at this is my fucking favorite thingOh god please PLEASE put someone with moral integrity into office this time around. There’s only so much disappointment I can handle. I hope enough Americans see what a sickening display of **corruption** our leaders have demonstrated and are finally inspired to vote in their own interests.\s\sIt’s outrageous that people such as senators Sanders and Warren have to fight so fiercely for our rights and freedoms. We need to join them in that fight.[deleted]Put this in the little “I’m from Georgia” comment thread above!This was the best moment in American politics in a generationBest moment I can remember.CNN uses deflection.\s\sIt was ineffective.this guy is awesome!He fucked shit up for the first half last night and I loved ithttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MAK7IsU2O44&feature=youtu.beFaiz Shakir did really well there honestly the first I've heard from him. These are the kind of people Sander's surrounds himself with instead of people associated with the industries controlling the media[deleted]There was a question about if m4a will raise middle class taxes. Which yes but by less than there insurance premiums deductibles and copays. It's a dishonest question on it's face and the moderators know it.Jake Tapper being Jake Tapper AGAIN. Glad Bernie called him out. He needs to keep doing it.He did amazing. It seemed like their strategy was to cut him off as soon as he got momentum (and they could justify it). They would let Pete ramble for many minutes but as soon as Bernie was gaining steam it was like MOVING ON... He did awesome though while they tried to cut him down every step of the way. Did you notice he was the only one they had a quote prepared for once again?\sAlso a lot of the centrist Democrats would be great to vote for if they ran Republican....John Delaney should just primary TrumpBernie pulling no punches love it!I don’t even like Sanders that much Yang supporter personally but last nights debate was fantastic and he did very VERY well.Not to be rude Yang is great but he is clearly not going to win the nomination and while you should continue to support him I encourage you to put some time and effort into Sanders as well so we actually have a chance of taking both Trump and Biden down.Those two should be The Team. Bernie with Warren as VP.  \s\sI've been vacillating between Bernie and Warren I really like Warren a lot. But Bernie has that fire in his soul. I am not sure how Warren would handle being stalked by trump Bernie would tell him to get the hell back to his podium.I'm down for a Sanders Presidency with Warren as VP.Pump this into my veinsAnybody see the advertisement in question with the talking point? Missed the debate but would be interesting to see the commercial.Ummmm.... What talking point???? It is cut outM4A will raise taxesBernie you're the president America needs! It's such an easy decision to make you're the only one that deserves to be our leader.BERNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN Baby!Is there a link to the question?I’m not saying ban it I’m saying that worrying about that issue is so minuscule compared to other issues.Stealing this for the archive at r/BirdieSanders2020Fuck Jake Tapper and CNN.  Bernie was on fire!Eat shit CNN. This is why Trump calls you the enemy of the people.Would have loved for Warren at the end there to turn to Jake and say ""You know what I'd like to hear what Senator Sanders has to say I give my time to the Senator Senator please finish your point"".\sI guarantee you that the place would have blown a lid from applause and it would have helped Warren too any Bernie supporters that don't want to or wouldn't support Warren if Bernie was out (Seriously what the fuck?) would immediately sit up and think ""you know what maybe I should give her a chance"".i am not in US and neither did I watch debates live on CNN. Can someone tell me if they really did run a pharmaceutical advert in between or after the debate??I watched online where they didn't show ads but people I talked to said they were airing insurance company and pharma ads the whole timeSanders isn’t my first choice but that was a baller move by sandersCnn is trash. In its death throesActually I thought they did a lot better than MSNBC not that that is saying much.I think that they looked good together; Sanders - Warren. \s\sThe rate limiter is if Warren can learn to manage without abusing the military to suckup to her amerikan uber capitalist butt buddies. Can she do it?Warren/Sanders is the ticket I wanna see I'd also settle for Warren/ButtigiegYou mean Sanders/Warren? I love liz but she has a better chance of being president if she drops out endorses bernie and he makes her VP[removed]Social policies like roads and public education work just fine to bring massive wealth to Americans.

No right?One would think the libertarians and small government conservatives would back Bernie on this issue.How so. Big government is the problem not wall street. Wall street can't buy politicians if politicians don't have the power to do anything. Remember the bailouts. That only happened because big government was able to do it. Bernie is the complete opposite of what any actual libertarian would want.  Bernie wants more government not less.Bernie’s in New York? Damn I wanna see him lmaoI love Bernie we have all these newer candidates but I loved and have always had faith in Bernie.washington post op-ed tomorrow: bernie claims to be for ""equality"" yet hogs an entire bench for himself.Could he use stream subs and donations on twitch for his campaign? Sounds like an awesome format: Bernie talks to regular people across AmericaI would be so star struck if I saw Bernie walking down the street. I can't believe people weren't swarming around him. Maybe it's because he's not so popular on Wall Street. :)It cannot be overstated the impact that Bernie has had on raising class consciousness. That is absolutely the first step in bridging the hyper-partisanship in US politics.We give Wall Street the power it has. Our money is just something we all choose to believe in as a way of interacting with eachother. Without money though we would still have eachother. It's  hard to imagine a world like that.Marxists call this reification. Our efforts are objectified into an alien force outside of and opposed to us. Related to this is commodity fetishism or the perception of the economy as relations between commodities rather than relations between people.I love these ""Bernie walking down the street talking about issues"" videos.\s\sHey campaign if you're reading: ""Bernie Speaks to America"".... revive the old format and have Bernie go out and talk to regular people and ask them their thoughts on things.Do townhalls on YouTube and on twitch. Answer hard questions. Bernie has the appeal.I would absolutely love more videos like this in different places around the country where he is talking directly to the camera.I am afraid for him.

Where are they running this ad?  Seems a bit long for a TV buy but if you could get this on the air I think people would stop and take notice.Nvm. It looks like this is a fan video. But it really really needs to be out there. This is probably the best political ad I’ve ever seen!I would have to bet they are running a shortened version of this in South Carolina but I’m not sure. I really hope they are.Can you imagine this playing during the Super Bowl?this is a brillaint adamazing stuffThat was damn fine. Let's fuck the right wing to death at the voting booths.I cried.This is without a doubt the best political ad I have ever seen.

Killer Mike's speech is near the end.Might be worth a google. I think its a church service. Probably where KM is prominent.Woh. Holy shit. That got me choked up.That’s incredible.Is this a fan made or official ad from the campaign? I hope this runs on TV - it's incredible.I’m pretty sure it’s fan made? I haven’t seen it on the main Bernie channel. But it’s way too long to be run on tv. Usually ads have to be 30sec-1min since it’s really expensiveI love how Bernie is somber at the start and when Mike starts to hit the peak and talks about looking at your neighbors he has a giant smile on his face.That actually made me short of breath. IncredibleReminds me of Malcolm X.

Time to donate another $27 and skip the fancy coffee tonight.Why is this not getting more views damnI want Killer Mike to speak at the Dem ConventionHow about Killer Mike 2028?crying from emotionHoly shit Killer Mike with that heat!I'm a Brazilian and as such I need someone like Bernie Sanders as the next US President. Our president relies on the false idea that he can do whatever he likes because he has the support of someone like Trump. We as Brazilians need a strong American President to make respectful and environment-friendly deals with countries like Brazil. This will impact a lot in our communities near or inside our rain forests. This will could also impact how our politicians  deal with minorities.I love Bernie's ads. I decided to look up Joe Biden's. They are all about him and Trump. He offers no policy just Trump is bad and he is good. He can't show tons of enthusiastic supporters or meaningful policy. His ads reflect that he has nothing to offer.Fuck me i can't believe i've never seen Killer Mikes speech on here. That was awesome.The most powerful political ad I have ever seenThis just made me cry so much.Killer Mike is one hell of a voice to have on a campaign he knows how to work a crowdKiller Mike killing it.Crying. I have so much hope for what is happening here.True inspiration cannot be faked. These adds that inspire rather than negatively attack are powerful. People have victim fatigue from all the politically centered negativity no one wants to be the victim over and over.  This is awesome.Theres no mention of Bernie throughout the whole ad until the last phrase. Its about the people and the voters. Very clever.In the US right now remaining emotionally intelligent in the face of attacks and being positive about the future of our country is rebellion.Wow I loved that!I usually think political ads are cheesy but that was fucking great. You know why? It was genuine passion. The same passion we all feel. Not some think lab group tested advertisement.YESSSSS YESSSSSS YESSSSS!!!LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. Can we get #TheTimeIsnow to trend on twitter?! LET'S DO IT!God*damn*.  KM is incredible. All teary now.Gives me goosebumps.Likewise. \s\sKiller Mike was very active in the 2016 campaign but he has elevated his passion for this campaign to a whole other level.  You don’t have to look too deep into to see he is a a paragon of an advocate for Bernie.  In addition to being a talented rapper and burgeoning entrepreneur in Atlanta giving back to his community Mike understands the passion and sacrifice required to accelerate a true grassroots movement and what’s at stake. He has worked so hard for this campaign already and we should all be grateful for such an intelligent and fervent fighter for freedom and justice for his peers and his country.and a tear or twoHoly ****RUN THE FOOLS\s\sout of office. And vote Bernie in!I see what you did there.  Noice!Holy shit. Bernie/Killer 2020Agreed.Now!I’m in tearsGod damnBernie really brings out the best in peopleThis is what i would want to see on a Superbowl commercial the amount of people that would hit would be amazing.Wow!Killer Mike is an amazing speaker. I’ve been impressed by his skills since his work with outkast on songs  like “the whole world” and “flip flop rock” on the speakerboxx album. Don’t even get me started on RTJ...\s\sHoping for Big Boi and Andre 3k endorsements too!He really is his Netflix show got a little strange but RTJ is amazing.Holy fuck. This needs to play during the SuperbowlHow much would that be?These supporter created videos are so so so powerful.  I cant ever seem to get through one of these without shedding a few tears.This is one of the most powerful speeches I have ever heard.Every person in America should see this video!Holy Jesus that was good.This is insanely good.God damn I love Killer Mike!!!!\s\sAnd let me just say that we have some amazing people for fighting for us Bernie AOC Michael Moore etc... This ad...wow I really hope this gets some play because this is extremely powerful!Share this it's brilliant.\s\sAnd it seems to be getting suspiciously downvoted.shut up I'm not crying. you're cryingThis shit hits hard because anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows that it's no joke. We know what it's like to be broke as fuck and feel completely helpless and it doesn't matter what your background is or the color of skin it's a shared experience that most americans have been through at some point. It's what brings us all together.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sOh yeah I'm bawling my eyes out right now this AD has power.The best time was yesterday the second best time is NOW. #Bernie2020!Wow i am speechlessNOWI remember this speech. Amazing. My favourite.This is the stuff dreams are made of.GODDAMN THAT WAS GOOD.  \s\s&#x200B;\s\sIs there anyway the campaign can reach out to whomever made this ad to see if it can become an official campaign ad? It's too damn good.I don't understand why no one has given an answer. It's really frustrating...This is everything right nowWow that was incredible. Just donated again!Wow. Takes your breath away.The best Bernie ad I have seen.Best anything I have seen ever.  So powerful.This ad is incredible (I've watched it about 12 times today already). I hope it pushes Bernie Sanders to where he should have been in 2016.\s\sThe time is **NOW**.Dude 🔥 🔥This is the one. To the top you go!\s\sWe are fighting algorithmically amplified speech. These algorithms favor emotions over content. This is raw emotion in a way I can't quite describe. This needs to be ***everywhere***.\s\sThe time is ***NOW***.Yes. What can we do?[We can do it!](https://i.imgur.com/vDAcI.jpg)Excited chills just resonated through me!Agreed! It pretty much makes me cry every time I watch it. Powerful.❤️❤️❤️❤️THE TIME IS NOW!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️spread it far and wideYou inspired me to post another ad/video which is Bernie Seven Nation Army / Trump’s Worst Nightmare.\s\sBut it wouldn’t let me post it saying the link had been used in the last sixty days. Like I think we should be able to share and view these awesome inspiring videos at will.  Why wait 60 days to view these great ads?  And I’d only seen the Seven Nation Army one once before.\s\sAnybody know or have advice?\s\sPS thanks for posting this video I love to see it and like others I get chills every time.Great speech I've never seen it before. Thanks.Someone should make a collection of these hype videos to make them easier to share.Agree it's fantastic!  I choked up watching it.Has this been used as a commercial? I have seen this video plenty but I'm not someone who needs convincing that Bernie is our best chance of being represented. This should be on all TV  AND radio airwaves. ""The time is...NOW!""\s\s**NOT ME. US**Literal chills every time. The Killer Mike speech needs to be broadcasted way more. It's one of the best things to come out of both of Sanders's runs and that's a pretty high bar imo.Bruh I had tears in my eyes watching this. It's so inspiring.OMFG that is unreal. I am in the verge of tears. Inspirational incredible that is some historic shit right there.Was this on the news?No justice no peace.[deleted]Presidental.The only man who could actually fix all of this.I want to say he was robbed but the truth is we were robbed. Could not agree more!!!! What a loss for us!! What a loss for US and the world!! Watching this video was so emotional!!Uprisings across the country! Can we bring an end to this corrupt racist sick bloated rabid system? Pick up the torch people!Un-suspend the campaign!Right nowwwwwWe failed Bernie at the polls. Where is Biden?  What a fucking joke.  I'm so disappointed.In all fairness Biden did give a speech on this topic.  Regardless Bernie did a great job discussing this specific incident in the context of systemic racism without diminishing the raw urgency.GO FUCKING BACK INTO CAMPAIGN NOW[deleted]Great statement by Bernie. Our local state and federal governments need to immediately start to implement the package of policy proposals that [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/solutions) offers to address the blatant problems in police relationships with our communities:\s\s> 1. **End Broken Windows Policing**: decriminalize crimes that do not threaten public safety end profiling and stop and frisk policies and establish alternative approaches to mental health crises.\s\s> 2. **Community Oversight**: establish effective civilian oversight structures and remove barriers to report police misconduct. \s\s> 3. **Limit Use of Force**: establish standards and reporting of police use of deadly force revise local police force policies end traffic-related police killings and high-speed chases and monitor how police use force and increase accountability for use of excessive force.\s\s> 4. **Independent Investigations and Prosecutions**: lower the standard of proof in civil rights cases against police use federal funds for independent investigations and prosecutions establish a State Special Prosecutor's Office for police violence cases and require independent investigations for all police killing or serious injury cases.\s\s> 5. **Community Representation**: recruit police officers who represent the demographic characteristics of their communities and use community feedback to inform policies.\s\s> 6. **Film The Police**: require police body cameras and legislate/uphold the right to record police.\s\s> 7. **Training**: invest in rigorous and sustained training and consider unconscious/implicit bias testing.\s\s> 8. **End Policing For Profit**: end police department quotas limit fines and fees for low-income citizens forbid property seizure and require police budgets to pay for misconduct fines.\s\s> 9. **Demilitarization**: end the federal government's 1033 Program to supply military weaponry to local police departments and institute local restrictions to prevent the purchase of military weapons by police.\s\s> 10. **Fair Police Contracts**: remove barriers to misconduct investigations and civilian oversight keep officer disciplinary history accessible to police departments and to the public and ensure financial accountability for officers and police departments that kill or seriously injure civilians.\s\sThis is the only way they can begin to regain any sort of trust & legitimacy. No longer can we stand a system that's meant to deal ""justice"" but instead deals injustice all the time.The police exist to protect the property of the elite. Don’t kid yourself. This will never happen.Thank you I’ve been looking for a way to help.Stop no knock raids.\s\sRemove qualified immunity.Or abolish police.Still the best candidate for President still on the ballot May 29 2020.Why the fuck doesn't he go back into campaign? FuckI'd also add end No-Knock Warrants. \s\sWhat happened in Louisville was absolutely appalling on so many levels.This is the shit that blows my mind the idea that it is somehow safer to serve a warrant at five a.m. rather than ten a.m. or something. \s\s\sDo the cops even know drug dealers? You show up at 5 and the guy and his peeps might still be up partying.\s\sYou show up at 5 to the wrong house and an innocent person wakes up scared and reacts like anyone would. it takes way longer to figure out the intruders in your home are police than it does to figure out there are intruders with guns in your place.\s\sThat gap in recognition is what got that EMT killed recently  and it's gotten scores of civilians and cops injured or killed.\s\sStupid tactic doesn't make anything safer!If you’re going to a protest please consider this app:\s\s\shttps://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct\s\sIt will enable you to quickly upload video to the aclu in the event that you are detained.Moving. The anger and energy of moving forward is palpable... but how?Hey Bernie - Brit here.\s\sI get that you don't want to split the Left but how can we bring your sanity to the Presidential election in November?\s\sBiden's better than Trump but if the voters can't get better than Biden (yourself) how can we get a ""Better Biden""?By Brit I interpret that as a UK denizen - you guys have your own problems with electing fucking Johnson of all people. Good luck with the shitheads of your own making.Unsuspend pleaseHe's so much more articulate than Joe Biden it makes my head spin. Compare this against Biden's address in Philadelphia this morning.And don't forget Biden is the very architect of mass-incarceration and the police state that so disproportianately affects black people. I still haven't consolidated the fact that Bernie endorsed him. He chose party over people in that momentIt is a person such as him it is words such as these it is  this clarity and this purpose that will move America forward. \s\sOtherwise the nightmare of capitalism and its happy marriage to authoritarianism and bigotry will continue unhindered.Mandatory independent investigation of police killings by the Justice Department  would be a great first step.Yeah they should've convicted him. He lied to congress under oath that is perjury.\s\sFurther if a local school principal got a blow job from a student teacher in his office and it became public knowledge would he get to keep his job? Of course not.\s\sClinton set the precedent that the president can lie and do unethical things without being punished. And if he had been impeached we would've had Gore and quite possibly no Bush no Iraq War and a much better country.\s\sWe need to hold the powerful to higher standards not lower.> Clinton set the precedent that the president can lie and do unethical things without being punished. \s\sNixon would like a word with you but yeah I know how you feel.I wasn't so much trying to defend Clinton as I was trying to draw attention to Sessions' own situation at the moment.\s\sBut ignoring that how do you figure we would've had Gore?\s\sClinton's popularity was actually pretty god damn high during the tail-end of his Presidency *(whether or not impeachment was deserved)* and Gore actually refused offers from Clinton to help him with his campaign *because of* the scandal and instead he moved to distance himself from Clinton something IIRC Gore later commented on regretting given the razor-thin margin it came down too.\s\sSo if anything one could argue that Gore moving closer to Clinton not farther away would've helped him more.        Don't think Gore becomes a shoe in if Clinton gets removed. One of many reasons Gore lost was because he distanced himself from the Clintons. The clintons SHOULD be in JAIL! Pay to play Benghazi the acorn scandal fast and the furious etc they are ALWAYS INVOLVED this is why I switched to  TRUMP in 2016 the dems rigged the election with their pay to play tactics which I am against and their hawkish policies Oh look another hypocrite. He should resign and go retire down in Alabamastan. Hillary also lied multiple times about her emails under oath when she was being grilled by the special committee hearing. No one gets in trouble for that shit anymore the elite will protect themselves.And guess what? Hillary lost the election. She is not in office. This chump shouldn't be the AG anymore. If you read the full question by Franken the ""perjury"" allegation is on much shakier ground:  \s\s>Franken: CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” These documents also allegedly say “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” Again I’m telling you this as it’s coming out so you know. But if it’s true it’s obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do?\s\s>Sessions: Senator Franken I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians and I’m unable to comment on it.I disagree but that also wasn't the only question asked on the subject:\s\s>In January Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (*D-Vt.*) asked Sessions for answers to written questions. “*Several of the President-elect’s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election either before or after election day?*” Leahy wrote.\s\s>Sessions responded with one word: “*No.*” Well I'm SURE he'll hold himself in the same highly respectable regard. Hahahhahahaha.Why is this in this subreddit. Bernie's not a Democrat. I will not accept that he is apart of that terrible corrupt losing party. /r/politics does a fine job of roasting Trump and all his cabinet picks over every move. This sub is supposed to be focused on the progressive movement - let them worry about the democratic distraction that is all the Trump administration news. Meanwhile the Dems are electing a DNC chalked full of establishment Democrats who are admitting that they're going to go beg corporations for money. Bernie also roasts Trump and all his cabinet picks over every move. Unlike you Bernie actually gives a shit that an incompetent bigoted crazy person is running our government. People on this sub are allowed to do so too. Sessions is a white Supremacist and a hypocrite scumbag and should be prosecuted along with the rest of the SCROTUS administration.Too bad you didn't include the entire interview she clearly doesn't know what she's talking aboutYeah it's a shame you didn't include it either I'd love to see itShe really is the poster child for the leftover Bernie or busters.  PerfectGood job! Stand your ground delegates! We love you and the revolution thanks you!He even said it himself. Hillary clinton has to earn our vote herself.Short and sweet.  Luv it. Would like to have seen the reaction and follow-up.Does anyone have a link to the full video? I'd love to hear the rest of her answer.bahahaha good lawdA fellow Middle Eastern!:)Haha i was dying watching this.   Amen sistaThat's fucking awesome thank you to all of the delegates screaming tonight you're the real MVPs.Her number will tank more. More leaks coming. Hopefully Bernie WILL have to come backLet's hope the leaks come soon...hopefully tomorrow!They'll bring Biden in or something. Bernie is the worst case scenario or the corporate dem party. The way she says it makes it that much better. Now that was a good video![deleted]Seriously. She said this with a SMIRK 24 years ago! My heroVery underrated part of this video indeed.Would be awesome if she endorses himI've never really thought about what my all-time favorite Bernie moment is... but if I did sit down and think about it I'd probably come up with this as my answer. Such a righteous RAILROADING.Funny story:\s\sDuke Cunnigham raved about stiffer penalties for drug dealers up to and including the death penalty. \s\sHis son Todd was arrested about four months after a particularly nasty speech for you guessed it trafficking over 400 lbs of marijuana from Mexico to Texas. \s\sAt the sentencing hearing Rep. Cunningham begged the judge for leniency which he got: two years behind bars. That sentence was given partly because Todd Cunningham *tested positive for cocaine 3 times while awaiting his trial.*\s\sProof positive you can be a decorated naval pilot a bad father a total hypocrite and a corrupt asshole all at the same time.That's how you get your own show on Fox.Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November.

Now therefore it is resolved that I Bernard Sanders mayor of the City of Burlington do hereby proclaim Saturday June 22 1985 as GAY PRIDE DAY in Burlington.""Why do I hear members of LGBTQ community say that Bernie doesn't care about them? Let me remember a comment a transgender woman (I believe) made on r/Beto2020 about why she supports Beto over Bernie:\s\s*Bernie seems to only care about economic justice and think social justice just comes along while Beto seems to genuinely care about social justice*\s\sNot the exact words but it was the message that was conveyed. I was surprised to say the least. How did this perception of Bernie not caring about the LGBTQ community spread around?Leftover Trolling fake news from 2016. Same folks that were saying Donald was going to be a champion of LGBT. Even trotted out that Kaitlin Jenner was a trump supporter so LGBT didn’t have to worry.inb4 republicans say that guy was planted to faint so bernie looks like a good guySeriously who is Bernie going to give his mic up for next?? #UnconsciousLivesMatterIt's almost as if \#AllLivesMatterGuys I get it but isn't this just him helping up a dude who fainted? Isn't that what anybody would do? \sWhere are you all from?Thank you The United States. It's incredibly rare for a serious candidate for president to not be concerned about his public image and to not try to play something like this off by maintaining a cool head (as Obama has done in the past) in fear of it backfiring on their campaign somehow. Instead he follows his instincts as a decent human being and helps the man. Those instincts in him are stronger than his desire to protect his campaign and that's why he should be president.The point is that politicians don't normally do that during speechesLet's post this 6 million times.When was this?[removed]No need to be so cynical. It's just nice to see a real person on the campaign trail instead of the robots we've seen as far as I remember.What a bunch of ass kissing. Getting really tired of this. There is some blatant manipulation going on in this sub. Sanders may very well be a well-meaning man but its disgusting how it's being spun here as a trait unique to him. Not a lot of audio there but that sounded brutal.  It was like a sack of concrete or landing on gravel.It almost seemed like he was expecting a gunshot. ಠ_ಠYeah his expression spooks me a bit for that reason.Because we all know there is no moral low that corporate America won't stoop to to protect their wallets.I feel like this is the one chance we get to elect someone who's genuinely just a nice guy. Whats with American election speeches and people fainting?It was almost a gunshot lol.  I hope that guy didn't fall down because of a gunshot.[deleted][deleted]I said it before the caucus Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who gives the impression that he genuinely cares about the well-being of this country and its people. God dammit I love this manOMG Bernie is literally Jesus! No one would ever stop a speech to help someone who fainted!... Is the man who fainted OK?For a 74-year-old damn he can move...Bernard must be sticking with his kale and cardio routine even on the campaign trail ;)If this doesn't show why he is a great man (politics aside) I don't know what will. It amazes me that some conservatives actually hate him. You can disagree on politics but you can't hate this guy. No bystander effect at all!That guy that fainted just wanted a handout! Bernie is here to take 90% of your paycheck and hand it to someone that couldn't bother to stay conscious! /sGoing door to door I met a lot of republicans who of course are against his policies but like the guy.  A lot of them  really don't like Hillary though.\s\sedit: grammarhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYLk-YxooR0[deleted]I'm a conservative. I don't hate him. I just disagree with almost all of his policies and certainly his ideology. He seems like a good person to me though. [deleted]> If this doesn't show why he is a great man\s\sIt doesn't. It shows he's a decent average human being.\s\sBut really that's already far more than what could the others pretend to be.Trump could do the same thing but that doesn't make him a great man> It amazes me that some conservatives actually hate him. You can disagree on politics but you can't hate this guy.\s\sYou could switch it around and say the same thing about Trump.\s\sEvery single one of Trump's speeches has multiple protesters interrupting or throwing things at him.  Bernie doesn't have this at his rallies.  So I would turn it around and say that it's the liberals who don't just disagree with his politics but rather actually hate him.Bernie thought it was a gunshot and took off like he did in his old track days.  Omg lolhttps://vine.co/v/iJgwjAgrrQK\s\shttp://dailycaller.com/…/hillary-jokes-about-woman-who-fai…/\s\sNow compare their reactions!\s\sThis could be a great thing to spread on facebook/twitter.Hillary reacted with a 404 Error? I KNEW she was a robot!I found [this one](https://youtu.be/78rfAAjriBo) from '08. Hillary seems a little concerned but then audibly sighs and jumps back into the stump speech on social security. Is there a good link for the daily caller clip?\s\sEdit: good [dailycaller link](http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/20/hillary-jokes-about-woman-who-faints-during-campaign-speech-video/)\s\sHonestly I don't think her reaction was bad. Just a lame joke. We can't expect everyone to look like he's about to tear off his shirt and reveal an S symbol and cape like Bernie did.When I just read the text I thought HRC did ok in handling the situation. Watching the video made her look really bad since she just stood there for a while and pointed.It took this flinch to realize that Bernie is very very Christ-like. His fights are very similar to the fights Christ had in the Bible. The fact you can tell the thought of being assassinated has crossed his mind shows that he knows he may be assassinated (or executed) as Christ was for his beliefs on society.legit moved to tears by this. A candidate that actually cares about the people.YES.  YES THIS.  WE ALL KNOW HOW HILLARY WOULD HAVE LET THE MAN DIE.  ALSO RUBIO WOULD HAVE KICKED HIM WHILE HE WAS DYING.  I'M PRETTY SURE I JUST SAW CHRIS CHRISTIE SPIT ON HIM.  ONLY BERNIE IS NOT KILLING THIS MAN.  WE MUST VOTE FOR BERNIE.Bernie's a good guy.The look on his face is beautiful. \s\s""OH SHIT IS THAT GUY ALRIGHT? better go check... brb.""If someone shot/shot at Bernie it'd become my life goal to find and kill that person But is that what Bernie would have wanted?Lmao something I haven't seen in politicians for a long time: humanity.He is America's grandpa. He just wants to help everyone and share ice cream with them.My life would be complete if I could say I got to sit down and eat ice cream with Bernie. Good on him to just run over and help out of instinct.\sThere's an article on gawker claiming this was a false flag because the same thing happened with a reporter earlier in the year...And Clinton supporters claim we are the conspiracy theorists....\s\shttp://gawker.com/bernie-sanders-just-stopped-a-rally-to-help-a-some-guy-1756963464Ridiculous 90% sure this was staged.[deleted]Sorry you got down voted for being a helpful person.Bernie is such a great guy. Damn recruit locking their kneesMaybe it's bias but that looks like the reaction of someone who legitimately cares. \s\sAnd I just can't imagine Hillary reacting the same. There are people that stand around at a moment like this thinking ""someone should do something"" and there are other people that think ""I've got to do something"".  It's not an extremely rare trait but it's a good one to have.Dont lock your knees\sIndeed. Had this happen to me once.Learned that in bootcamp. Had a pilot fall face first to the deck while in formation. She broke her jaw and lost a few teeth.Marching Band 101.But why are the lolis only for Trump?I've been wondering why I get dizzy when I lean over the bathroom sink to get a clean shave!Omg Bernie went to go help someone who fainted. I bet Trump would just stand there and laugh. /sYou didn't need the ""/s"".  It is true.You want this man to be President of the world!He is the president you need America.[deleted]I really think he's just one of the kindest most genuinely good human beings in politics today. Part of why I've loved him for so long is how human he is. And he's a good one.Not trying to call you a liar or something. But do you have a link to a video of this happening? \s\sEDIT: Should have googled before I made the comment :D \s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9qgKQunphEJust saw the video and you're twisting it a tad bit > I was at an Obama speech back in '08 and the same thing happened. Obama said calmly: ""lets get someone over there to help"" and then made a joke ""This happens a lot at my speeches"" with a smile and a chuckle. \s\s\sObama was no where near that person A real human egg> He's a good egg.\s\sThis is the most proper description of Bernie I've ever heard. That's... Really not what happened. \s\sEdit: I don't get it. Why lie to make Sanders look better and make others look bad? It did not happen the way you claim. You should know better. This type of behavior is what I would expect from Clinton supporters. Not Sanders supporters. It's really gross and it gives Sanders supporters a terrible name. Stop being immature and focus on the important stuff not lying and twisting truths to try and show how much better Sanders is. If this happened at a Hillary rally everybody would be claiming it was staged.ummm have you read the comments. People say it was staged with bernie. It'd be interesting to see all the other candidates react in a situation like this Kind of using the term ""running"" looselyI may not agree with his politics but I certainly don't need to to understand that he's an amazing personTrump would yell at this woman for interrupting himLets be fair here a similar situation happened at a Trump-event and he actually stopped his speech and asked if there was a doctor in the room#TheBernUnitI cant wait to see the memes people make from this Expect in the next few days someone to suddenly pass out at a Clinton event and her also running to help that person.Nah more studies are needed first for her.save him crazy grandpa!  No hesitation. That's character.How can someone go from their life flashing before there eyes to immediately trying to help someone. Amazing. The guy doesn't have the phony sophistication robot non sense that other politicians try to show. Even his opponents respect him for that. Phony robot? Sounds like a certain Arkansaucian...lol totally stagedI mean it *was* on a stage. :p lol. But no that's genuine. LoL you trollMan i wish this dude was running for prez (Prime-Minister) in my country. A) he'd win easily B) he seems like an actual good person. Bernie being a broDamn he actually went to him. Now that is amazing. Wanted to get his wallet before the ambulance arrived. ""Free"" doesn't grow on trees. Well I can tell you didn't go to school. School is a socialist system and you'd never take part.What a wonderful man. Isn't Bernie too old to be President?\s\sWhat if he faints?\s\sWouldn't his runninmate who would probably be some communist like Michael Moore then be president? Get out of here troll![removed]These types of comments trashing Hilary are exactly what Bernie doesn't stand for...I really wish I was an American citizen so I could vote for this guy. \s\s\sI just hope he gets elected and I get to witness America get better. [deleted]Donation link right here.\s\shttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/reddit-for-bernie/This is honestly... adorable.\s\sI don't even know how he's been involved all these weird shitty political issues for so long and is still just so chill as a person.It's almost like he's a human being with empathy reacting normally *gasp*I watched a little girl's balloon escape from her hand as she was in her father's arms walking past. I was sitting on a bench and I saw it move very slowly about 2 metres in front of me running low on helium it bounced on the ground. I watched the dad figuring surely he would soon react to her shrieking cries for her lost balloon. About 5 seconds passed during this time and the balloon was getting closer and closer to a busy intersection in the middle of the CBD. I watched the balloon bounce into the intersection and get run over by a car and I felt horrible since that entire time I was asking myself ""Should I help and grab the balloon?"". Not everyone has a quick and correct reaction like this Vine depicts.If this were at Trump rally: \s\sTrump: ""Security get this man out of here!""\sCrowd: ""WOOOOOOO TRUMP 2016 YEEEHAWWWWW""This already happened at a Trump rally in October and he stopped the speech until he was sure the woman was safe. This is a man of action and the president the American people deserve. If it were Trump the man would have been escorted out by security for disturbing his speech. And if the lack of dirty campaign contributions lack of dirty tricks the genuine care for the middle class and the history of being an honest politician on the national stage wasn't enough Bernie just oozes everyday character. \s\sYou never see the candidate be the first one to rush to see if everything's okay. They either duck cower or continue their speech that was so ""rudely"" interrupted. \s\sI'm careful to stick to discussing what Bernie believes in so that I don't sound like a circlejerky fanboy but I see this video and just think ""wow.""\s\sPayday is soon. I think it's time to donate again.The flinch is the only part of this that scares me. Because the fall sounded like a gunshot.In all fairness to Bernie a body hitting the floor of one of those raised platforms sounds a lot like a gun shot.  I'd flinch too.Yeah did you see his  that's a man that knows at any second some nut job could take him out. That makes me sad but also he keeps going and fighting anyway just dear god look in his eyes and on his face that was a total is this the day lookAh man. One time my pretty conservative uncle told me about Kennedy getting killed. He said something I never forgot... ""They took him from us."" And then he got very quiet and sad. He then said nothing was ever the same after they killed Kennedy. My uncle never supported another candidate again. He honestly couldn't do it ever again after Kennedy's assassination.\s\sThank god that Sanders has Secret Service protection but that didn't stop them from killing Kennedy. Ford almost got killed and Reagan almost died on the operating table. Sanders knows he is putting his own life in danger but he knows that he has to for the good of the country.[deleted]I think it honestly sounded a lot more like a gun on video than it did in person. Probably flinched since it's very unexpected. \s\sBut I agree with your sentiment I had the same thought at first. that was the first thing that came to my mind as well. \s\sThis is really dark but that is what his face would look like if he heard the gunshots of an assassin. :-( I didn't see it until you mentioned it. But Bernie's reaction is telling: The reaction of someone who thought something they had expected had happened. Also notice his surprise at the person fainting it is delayed.\s\sThese reactions could be written off as nothing but just *watch* a few times. All the signs are there.That noise was awful.  Reminds me of an incident when I was in boot camp.  We were all sleep deprived and had to stay awake during boring classes that started at the crack of dawn.  One guy kept nodding off and slamming his forehead into the muzzle of his rifle.  We're taught to stand up and move to the side or back of the room if we're having trouble staying awake so this guy stands up to one side of the room.  A few minutes later we heard a loud crash as the guy face-planted into the floor.  Pretty sure he broke his nose and had a concussion.  It was so hard not to laugh but we would have gotten destroyed if we made a sound.this is kind of interesting since I only though of it sounding like a gunshot after I read the comments. My first thought was that a broom or something similar dropped.I'm not sure what you're saying. That you shouldn't flinch if you hear something that sounds like a gunshot?He went to see if a person who fainted was ok....  So relatableI've been actually thinking about the scenarios that would play out if he got the office and then got capped. None of the outcomes end well for the general public.Clinton would laugh. This is such a metaphor for the campaign too. Clinton is the bystander who doesn't want to step out of line and rock the boat while Bernie just takes action.In a campaign that has time and time shown how human Bernie is this is his most human moment. I thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/YifevOC.gif?noredirect) was pretty human.It reminds me of when Andrea Mitchell almost got trampled and Bernie rushed over there like a lion to make sure she was okay. He has said he values compassion and he has it. I believe he has said compassion is what he'd like to be remembered for.""Oh my gawd!""[deleted]I wonder how much Hillary would have charged to do that?[deleted]I know right? What a ridiculous proposition that a presidential candidate could show a genuine human reaction to something odd happening. \s\sall /s aside it's sad that americans think that standard human behaviour when done by someone famous is a publicity stunt aimed at getting more votes.TrollJust goes to show Bernie just wants to help his fellow Americans.We The People love you Bernie\s\sPOTUS or notPOTUS or POTUS* ftfyMy new favorite Sanders moment.What's up with people fainting at Bernie's rallies? Similar thing happened at the one in Atlanta. Guess they felt the bern too hard People stand outside for hours to be near the front of the line to get in so they can be behind him on stage. Then after getting in they stand for even more time. Even for fit folks that can take its toll unexpectedly even more so if they aren't in the best condition.It's a hazard of standing for a long time with your knees locked. As a few others have stated before when you lock you knees all of your blood starts to pool in your feet/legs pulling it away from the brain. Same thing happened to me when I was in marching band in high school; once I stopped locking my knees it never happened again.I love bernie so muchBernie has some wheels for an older guy!!![removed]I don't see bernie being that good of an actor. His reaction came off as pretty genuine to me. Caught being human.""oh my gaud""His accent is just another strong point on his foreign policy; nobody fucks with someone that has a Brooklyn accent.ohmigoawdPeople pass out at these things allll the time. For every candidate. Remember the one from a couple years back where Obama almost literally caught a falling pregnant woman behind him during a conference?\s\sI love Bernie. But I'm just saying. Shhh we must all praise Sanders as jesusLate. Buried. Etc. To me the president is just a figurehead. He or she literally represents the United States. I want a good person to represent all of us. Everytime I see this video I want Bernie to become our president even more. When he realized what happened he didn't give a damn about whatever he was talking about anymore. He just wanted to make sure that dude was okay. THAT'S the kind of person I want as our leaderYour mouth to God's ear. I just love how genuine it is. It was his first instinct to abandon what he was doing and check on the guy. He wasnt thinking about ratings and polls he jumped in and did the right thing. dafuq's a presser?cool white kid scion owner for press conferenceWhat other candidate would run over to actually check on the person to see if they were ok? Every other candidate in this Presidential race would just stand at their podium ask if they were ok and move on regardless of whether or not the person was ok. They don't care but Bernie really does care about others deeply.Yup. Don't forget the smile and look for cues from the audience.\s\sIt is really subtle but he doesn't hesitate for one second. He doesn't care if people care or how it makes him look. There is nothing calculating about it. Just basic human decency.\s\sAnd I am still baffled that he has kept his when being a sucessful politican is so much about being calculatingOne of the comments on Vine:\s\s""Quick! Get this man some free healthcare!"" XDITT people pretend no one else would run over and that Bernie can actually do something helpful instead of just getting in the wayITT people missing the point that his instinctive reaction is to assist people in trouble.i always assume that every word and action coming from a politician in public is an ""act"" or planned but this seems like a natural reaction Dude this is like the third time Bernie has had to rush to someone's side who fainted.  That's crazy.  Some people have to learn ""Don't lock your knees"" the hard way. Rockstar status does that yo.[deleted]He wasn't flinching. It seems like he thought It was a gunshot intended for him and tensed his body naturally like most of us do when something comes flying at our bodies. That reaction Is very telling he's scared and It sucks that the only people that will be protecting him ( Secret Service ) work for a government that does not represent what he does. > tensed his body naturally like most of us do when something comes flying at our bodies\s\sya flinching\sWhat? If he becomes President the Secret Service will be working for him for all intents and purposes. The thing that impresses me about that clip is that Sanders takes no time to think once he's realized what's happened: He doesn't pause to consider he's on camera and at the lectern he doesn't pause to wonder what should be done or to see if somebody else is dealing with it he just goes to help.\s\sThat's a man with empathy and compassion there.Am I the only one who misread the title as ""...man who farted at his presser""? I only rechecked the title when I noticed no one in the comments was laughing.Why does he already seem so tense before the man drops is he always like that? The man is from Brooklyn. Of course he's tense.three other people went to help should they run for president too??\s\ssanders could fart in a jar and you people would some how find a way to praise him for it..[Source Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHC7qwHmig)That's the President I want one that runs to help someone in need.Google already has storys saying it was all faked and what's sanders hiding  its really kind of sad to see the press twist this into something its not he really cares that is all there is to itMakes me immensely sad. I don't even think I can grasp the level of twisted unscrupulous mentality people who run smear campaigns have. It's totally beyond me. It's because last election they had the same fainting occur in many electoral speeches and campaigns. There were many videos out about how Obama and Hillary would almost see it coming. Then immediately say ""Make some room. Get them some water. Where is the medical personnel?"" It was so cookie cutter it was actually funny to see. The fact that Bernie ran over made it look much more personal whether it was staged or not. Sanders' look of 'wtf just happened' is either genuine or he's rivalling Regan in acting ability.This guy has clearly been acting like a decent person with integrity for 60-some years solely to deceive the American people into thinking he's *not* Larry David. Today the deception came crashing down and he gave himself up.This man hates punctuation.To be fair if this was at a Hilary speech this thread would be full of that same skepticism.I mean your should always be open to interpretation. Not that I would ever think Bernie would do that.Alpha House with the light falling over?This is a man I want to be president.\sThis shows honest instinctual caring about people.\s\sCan you imagine any other candidates reaction? I can and most of them back away until someone else moves in.\sThat brought a tear to my eye... Compassion is in his nature... Everyone else just stood and watched as the true LEADER did what he did Jewish man rushes to help the sick the poor and the needy. Was he mayhaps a carpenter before running for office?He was actuallyI love this man. He is so genuine. WHAT A HERO.  HILLARY WOULD HAVE JUST SPRINTED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  An amazing president but an even more amazing Human being. What are people doing? Everyone else is just looking. That's not right.Much strong oratory  #thingsmostpoliticiansdontdo\s\sI seriously believe if it was anyone else they would have tried to keep going and assumed someone was handling it. It's going to hit me so hard if we don't get him as our president.This speaks alot to the kind of person he is.  Trump/hillary probably would of asked security to remove the weak ass hole ""oh my""\s\sgeez he's the cutestI love how his reaction is purely instinctual - he dropped everything and went to help the man without a second thought.That was my favorite part too. After he made sure it wasn't a gunshot he showed no hesitation running over. [removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]I have been in similiar situations and it takes a few secs to process what is going on... that said Bernie reacted like somebody that should be and is in charge of shit.  This has happened at least two other times that I know of.....Bernie makes everyone weak in the knees\s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_2xIb0t1g  (at 28:50)\s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYLk-YxooR0\sI'm curious are Bernie's security the ones he hired or Secret Service? I've heard that they're Secret Service before from some where but can't recall  When was THIS? This is the 3rd person I've seen faint at his rallies!Too much excitement in this campaign.ITT People who don't know how loud a gun indoors is. [deleted]one upvote doesn't feel like enoughThat ladies and gentlemen is a ""Doer."" \s\sIn my experience most people will suffer from bystander effect and passively watch. Not many people react with out hesitation like this. Just look at all the people behind him they barely turn their bodies by the time Bernie had rushed over to aid. \s\sI am going to vote for him so hard. I CHOOSE MY PRESIDENT BASED ON HOW THEY REACT TO PEOPLE FAINTING.  fainted or swooned?As a Sanders supporter I wouldn't mind of this was staged because people need to know that he's spry enough for office.It's not.stagedCame here with the usual expectation that the point/comment I want to make has already been made (typically in a much more sophisticated and well-reasoned fashion).  Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case this time so I will bungle my way through on my own.  \s\sWhat was striking to me was that after his initial reaction to a loud unexpected noise he sought to ascertain the source.  The second he saw the man on the ground he became a man of action. Though he is often poo-pooed for tying nearly every policy issue back to income/social iniquity what is missing from that analysis is that his TRUE underlying policy positions are compassion and action.  His empathy is what keeps him focused on the underlying systemic problems.  His desire to serve/act is what makes him the candidate I support.  Does it make me crazy if I think this seems staged? Yup.  I think you are confusing a Sander's presser with a Clinton one.they didn't listen...No I don't think it makes you crazy.  I'm pretty much a Bernie nut and I have my doubts hehe.Ofc its staged but people think Bernie is gonna change the world. Let them dreamHe's so sweet!I respect Bernie for this because of how natural it is. He took a millisecond to react to move over there. It was obvious that this was a genuine reaction and not simply a PR stunt. The guy literally flinches turns to see what the noise was and immediately rushes to go aid the man that fell. Totally genuine and a beautiful showing of genuine compassion.It's almost like I'm reading a futuristic novel where robots have replaced the human race and ""human"" qualities are seen to be fashionable for some perverted reason. Wow look at this BernTron2016 his emotional processor is so sophisticated that he was able to react just like a human! *Do it for the Vine*it amazes me that of all the people younger than him he has the fastest reactionsAnd dem eyebrows in that millisecond. You can't fake that.Literal superhero. Hillary would run to his side to see if any money feel out of his pockets when he fellWas the guy alright?Sure a lot better than Kerry's reaction to a guy getting tazed right in front of him a few years back.  Inhuman reaction award.  Looks like Sanders passes the robot test.> Kerry's reaction to a guy getting tazed right in front of him a few years back.\s\sThat has to have been a put on job....nothing in real life can be that funny.\s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bVa6jn4rpEHoly shit that looks staged!How so? It's a short clip and you just see his reaction and not the man falling down. Also if it was staged what would it achieve? ""OH my god"" His genuine concerned tone is beautiful This is the second time someone has fainted? The last video I saw the guy was to the right.5th or 6th I think. Happens to every candidate I think its more visible with Bernie because there are more people closer to him. Public gets so caught up in listening that we forget to unlock our knees from time to time. Blood pressure drops and down we go.Bernie is Bernie and the man who fainted is the middle class. Bernie running to the rescue!\sWhat is actually going on?Bernie holds speech guy faints Bernie runs to his side[deleted]The sound that guy makes when he hits the floor did kind of sound like a gun shot. It's kind of sad to think that Sanders has to be worried about getting shot. It's a good thing his last name isn't Kennedy.I actually kind of wonder if he thought maybe that person got shot.Good point. His empathy runs deep.Dude's awesomeMan must be an onion round somewhereThis needs to go to the front page. I love the last shot with the rose 🌹Hi guys so this video helps me to push when I'm feeling like I can't do anything more to help Bernie. This is what we are fighting to change. #WhyWeNeedBerniePart of the problem of wealth inequality is that the problem is so bad that people don't believe it to be true.I know I told my lab group at my school that one family the waltons own more wealth than the poorest 50% of Americans. One guy was like but most of those people are broke right? Everyone else in the group just stared at him until he backtracked and said but that's still bad. We have to spread the word so people aren't uniformed.I like this video and it proves a good point but I can just let his depiction of socialism go uncommented what he claims socialist wealth distribution looks like is actually the idea for communism...so many people are relatively illiterate when it comes to political ideologies.I know but I think you could tell it was not genuine when he said ""The dreaded Socialism."" I bet you he knows that's not what socialism is but I don't think the video was going to go into the nuances of Socialism and Communism. nyway hope you enjoyed it overall.Just be careful this says 'dreaded socialism' amd the picture it paints for socialism is wrong; being total equity. You need to make sure people don't misundertsnad.I'm starting to use #WhyWeNeedBernie and then posting articles/graphics like this detailing problems.Good idea thanks. Ill give it a go as well.This was published in 2012 it's only gotten worse since"

From all the studies I’ve read it’s much more common for smart & successful people to get brainwashed by propaganda than for propaganda to cause so much “dissonance” that people stop thinking straight.\s\sI think it’s important to recognize that tribalist influencing & conspiracy theories don’t discriminate by IQ. Our brains seem as if they’re built to **constantly** affirm our preconceived notions especially when they’re logically inconsistent. Critical thinking is its own independent skill.Too many people are taught from birth the willful ignorance of accepting information and instruction from their cult's chosen leaders with unquestioning blind faith.Typical Trump BootlickersReminds me of something Chris Rock said. How calling out this guy for his contradictions “is like playing basketball with a retarded kid and calling him for double dribble. You gotta let some shit slide.”Except in the game of politics the ""retarded"" kid's vote counts as much as yours does.Navy veteran. \s\s*NEVER* alter the flag with the name of anyone on it. \s\sIt’s revolting.LolEvery trumpist>I love the uneducated...I was just thinking about this the other day. How all these thin blue line and thin red line flags are actually desecrating the American flag. The American flag is a symbol of unity of the nation and these alternate versions are elevating one group over all others.Unpopular opinion: The whole “muh flag desecration” is 5 times more cringey when liberals like this pasty toothpick do it.Most likely he doesn't give two shits about flag desecration. He was demonstrating the other guy's hypocrisy and ignorance.Freedom of speech actually covers all of this as much as it does flag burning. It's fun however to point out though when someone's outrage is selective or their position is intellectually inconsistent.Do you even know what irony means?Share this everywhere.I’ll try to. It was very interesting listening to his conviction.They were never fiscal Conservatives dad.  That was all a lie used to bludgeon their opponents.   When given the opportunity to be fiscally Conservative they spent like madmen and cut taxes for the rich.   Every single time.They are anti welfare and pro corporate welfare.This but louder and higher up. Even now after 2 trillion in tax cuts for billionaires and the largest transference of wealth in stimulus money for the rich. Now leaving 29 million Americans food insecure with the largest unemployment/under employed rate since the great depression. It's now the republicans are just suddenly concerned about the deficit. Not when Trump added over 3.9 trillion to the deficit with socialism for the rich but just now when the opposing admin is taking office. Now it's time to defund social security education healthcare and every other public service that doesn't contribute to endless war. My god america at some point you gotta realize that you are the “people"" part in the old saying of “putting profits over people.""This is 100% accurate.   The phrase fiscal conservative was a label used to indicate that they did not give other people money.  Meaning they were firmly against welfare programs.Exactly which is why I did not believe 1 word that came out of his mouth except demagogueRepublicans get so much praise for so little.And a bit late in changing your mind after you've actually voted and lost.Republicans understand messaging. They are able to spin the worst policy possible into something that sounds beneficial to the public and make even slightly left-leaning policy sound like it will literally destroy our country. \s\sDems need to learn this. Progressives have started to learn but it hasn't reached the mainstream of the party.It is amazing how low the fucking bar is.  I remember when Republican got praised for questioning the Obama birther conspiracy...so brave.  \s\sLook at Trump all he has to do is not be crazy and talk like a normal human for five minutes and people throw praise at him.Republicans are like the rich kids who get a new car for getting a B+ which is the highest grade they can ever achieve. The other side gets obliterated for being anything less than perfect. “Why don’t you get all A+ when you’re supposed to?”\s\sAsian kids can relate./r/AbsoluteUnitsBoth parties magically rediscover the Constitution and the growing national debt when they're not in power. \s\sIt's like clockwork.\s\sAlso the biggest issue the media/establishment had with Trump is that he gives the war machine a bad look. \sObama could smooth over bombing brown people and getting us into war but Trump has no such likeability to leverage.Yeah nailed it.\s\sCertainly wasn’t him encouraging his followers to assault their fellow Americans and he’d cover the legal fees.\sCertainly wasn’t him alienating our allies (and literally shoving them on the world stage) and falling “in love” with dictators.\sNah had to be this myopic thing.He was holding his nose the entire time. \s\sI don't believe a word that he said.\s\sBULLSHIT.  Was playing for his daughter or whomever that was recording him.You’re a terrible read of people. You should work on that. \s\sIt hurts him saying this. That’s all you’re seeingI almost feel sorry for you.So is this guy a politician himself? He mentions becoming an independent I'm confused because it almost seems on America people consider themselves the party they think they belong too or pledge loyalty to or whatever. Which is equally perplexing.\s\sI don't understand why people don't allign themselves to their own policy preferences and check each election year which party best represents their own policy values in a kind of shifting basis.Yeppers. In America political parties are teams with colors and logos. It's customary to publicly humiliate your opposing fellow voter after an election. If you're not laughing about making your fellow voters cry then you're not doing American politics right. Also you actually never lose because the other side stole the election and you get to concoct an elaborate scheme to make them pay if that happens. Sometimes you need help from an American adversary but that only makes the fight more interesting! Wait until next season!!!Man I know people in the U.S who vote red just because it's their favorite color. \s\sPeople as a whole will always gravitate towards the stupidity.\s\sEdit: Maybe that's a little over the top and cynical a way of putting it but still.A lot of people do. That’s why swing states go back and forth.I'm not a Republican and never have been but he is absolutely right in his description and criticism of the party. It's not just a bunch of racists it is certain ideals that *do* have their appeal mixed with shit spewed by Trump (along with some other shitty ideals that *have* been their a while as well)[deleted]Y’all are really cynical pessimistic and frankly really depressing for what??? Like chill and relaxEhh in the video you can hear the wife saying she left the party when Trump was nominated. Seems like a familial trend.Well that's not going to happen as he has sworn off Fox in favor of OAN Newsmax and Parlor... oops...Right? This dude is going to continue voting red. I bet he voted for Trump twice and will a third time.Sadly I think you're right. It's hard to believe that someone who wasn't disillusioned with the party until this election could ever become truly disillusioned with the party. Trump isn't the subversion of the Republican Party he's the personification of it.You are the hopeful progressive we are aspiring to be!Probably.  I thought after everything that's happened since 2016 there was no way Trump had gained voters.  But lo and behold he's gained around 11 million from 2016 to 2020.  We're fucked.Demagogue bullshit-artist carnival promoter. I love it! Can you ask your Dad if I can use that?We need more Dads like this!Maybe 4 years ago.  Too little too late in my book.My dad left the GOP during W because his sons were military/draft age it reminded him of living with the Vietnam draft hanging over everything he did.Why doesn’t everybody just be independent and vote each year for whoever they want regardless of party? Who gives a flying fuck about the two political parties we have?In Pennsylvania we have closed primaries.  Dems can only vote for Dems and Republicans for Republicans.  If you are a registered Independent you can only vote in the general election.  This is one of the many election laws that prop up the two party system.since the day i registered..Because Independents were also founded on White Supremacy and racism. I try to remind people that when they try switching from a party to Independent. Just look up the segregationist policies the newly Independent Party ran on in 1968. \s\sEven Libertarians don't pass the smell test because it seems like Libertarians don't even know what they want.This is a better troll than when I went fishing in Florida a few weeks ago.Looks like Brendan Gleeson and sounds like John Goodman.I was really dreading that he was leaving the party because not enough conservative politicians and media outlets are supporting Trump's denial of our recent election results. Pleased to see I was wrong. Regardless there's going to be a massive division within the republican party as many trumpsters are dissenting from even fox to jump on his newly announced q-anon type news network. Either way I hope there's a good contingent of folks who are like this guy.Been a while since the GOP was fiscally conservative too pal.If he voted Biden and R down the ballot then he shouldn’t really be complaining about them doing what they are supposed to do as RepublicansCringe nostalgic swamp dwelling bush supporter. 4 more yearsawww why'd you cut it off ?[deleted]https://gfycat.com/ConcernedCooperativeArachnid\s\s---\s\s^(I am a bot.)

Not because I agree with their policies but because I disagree with democratic policies more than republican ones. The problem with parties is that you are picking a side and you really shouldn’t do that when it comes to politics. Look at each candidate and look at his or her policies. \s\s“However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.""- George Washington farewell addressSomebody call CNNSo proud of him. As a man from the south it’s like a part of the culture and you literally get ostracized for being a godless liberulTruly amazing to see anyone be in a lifelong political position regardless of what their party has done. This doesn't deserve praise but rather awareness.Paraphrasing Chris rock here that I'm conservative about some shit and I'm liberal about some shit!! Do not put yourself into a box that you cannot change out of!!! They want to divide us and they are succeeding!!A bit late to the party but my dad said this too.

Obviously Dems have their own set of issues to deal with but a mass of older racially prejudice supporters isn’t one of themReminds me of the video of a life long democrat  who explains why he has left the party and is now an IndependentWeird commentGood comment comrade. Have welfare potato.Even when he left the party he still defended them saying they aren’t just a bunch of racists.I think you misinterpreted his tone he meant to say they are not ONLY a bunch of racists they are also blindly following their Demi-god trumpI love how when she said it's a party of racists he said ""nah it's not only that""That's a fancy way of calling Trump a carnie. I love it 😂Respectable manEh fuck this guy though. The racism wasn't enough for him the bigotry wasn't enough for him the sexism wasn't enough for him. To only arrive at this NOW means he was okay with all of that shit. He stomached it until now. Fuck this old fart too. \s\sRepublicans has been racist for a long long time all of this old man's life. He was fine with the southern strategy this whole time. Fine with it through Nixon through Reagan through Bush another Bush Romney and he probably voted for Trump twice. But NOW he is done?\s\sSo FUCK him. And fuck Trump too.\s\sAll of you that don't follow history that think life began with Trump have no idea. You need to do your research. The republican strategy has been racist in intent to get elected for over 50 years all the time that this man could legally vote and on. Anyone with a brain and a library card can see and understand this.People can still change though! This was obviously the final push for him. I have a friend who's boyfriend happened to be a republican and after educating him for a while he started to see the problems with it. While we are younger it was nice to see how his view changed after over 15 years of believing the same things. Republicans being able to see reason even if just a little is a step in the right direction. People can unlearn racism and seixism. We can unlearn hate. As long as try and educate the people around us (online or physically) then we can further a more accepting society. Putting this kind of stuff online can inspire kids with republican parents and make them kinder and make them raise kids who are kinder.Damn dad calling it EXACTLY how it is.The GOP has been sucking up to Trump's conspiracy propaganda and fake efforts for years now already. The only thing that's changed is that fox is shifting its alliance off Trump directly as he continues to embarrass himself internally by not submitting defeat like a mature adult would.Yeah trump screwed them forever because unless your like him or praise him he'll tell the voters not to vote for you and they won't! They love their god trump!We need to remember that it’s not the Republicans but rather the Trump administration that is causing all this turmoil. I’m an independent but the vast majority of Republicans are perfectly sensible people; however the Trump administration is not.Republicans enabled Trump. For five fucking years (I’m including the ‘16 campaign). The entire party rallied behind this conman stuck with him and even abandoned their own morals to suck up with him. It was always obvious Trump was a conman a crook a creep and a fucking baby. \s\sUntil republicans unequivocally denounce Trump they’re complicit.No. Fuck the Banana Republicans.Didn't the vast majority of republicans vote for 4 more years of that in your own words insensible administration? How does that make them sensible?If most Republicans were perfectly sensible people they wouldn't have nominated Trump twice.Trump and McConnell you mean.  And all the sorry republican ass kissers like Graham and Cruz that enable trump.There is no shame in admitting that you were speaking from a place of ignorance no matter how late it is. Shows great maturity! 👏🏽He'll probably still vote republican tho. Good on him getting rid of the labeling nobody should be registered as a republican after the past 4 yearsSmart manThe man is a legend!He seems like a more center right guy. Mad respect to this dude for being reasonable and intelligent.BasedI love this so much.  My grandparents are super Trump supporters and I had to listen to my grandmother over thanksgiving (yes we met over thanksgiving...not my idea!  I didn't wanna be there!) praise that man as if Jesus himself gave him the title of ""President"" and how shameful it is that America has given up Trump's greatness for the radical left socialism of Joe Biden.\s\sI swear I thought I was going insane.which is still insane. Biden isnt even close to socialist. Hes a moderate democrat. Now if bernie was the nomination theres some merit but Biden is pretty middle of the road.This is good for the world. Cheers to your dad. My family’s always considered ourselves fiscally conservative and socially democratic (to varying degrees). The point is it really is so important to stand FIRM in what you personally believe in. Don’t let any party define you. The term ‘party’ has become so oxymoronicSir you had me @ demagogue :D ... Also thanks for teaching me a new word. Heard it before but now I know it's meaning I agree with your usage. N for the record no he's not bs-ing this man's completely bummed the Reps have acted *and continue to act* the way they have. If it was a setup he'd be all hyper left side with it. Nope man's seriously bummed. Now who else wants to slide a bit to the middle?Good that he noticed Trump was bad.\s\sBad that he thinks that they weren't bad before.I think this would fit in at r/trumpgretLeaving now after they lost but sticking around when they selected the demagogue and then swallowed all his crap 4 years with a smile?

Is this scumbag broadcasting from Dallas?lol what a douchebag. oh wait it's newsmax the actual fake news networkWe dont criticize trump round here we suck his dickThe host litterally says:\s\s> Trump wanted to pull out badly but he didn't because he knew it would happen.\s\sGuest is just saying that ""with more preparation and constructive actions this could have been avoided"" but host in going off the deep end then blames Biden for ""what everyone knew would happen"" including Trump.People on the right realy hate the vets“We love our vets”\s\sRaise funding for the VA and house the homeless ones ?\s\s“ No not like that.”fuck these religious nazisWahhh! You’re not allowed to criticize my perfect president! I swear these people need to learn to actually accept and understand criticizing their own party members. “liberals” “leftists” democrats whatever we’re called are actually able to criticize Biden because we don’t hold him on some golden thrown even when he fucks up.I have tried to explain this to them a million times . “ I think the problem is you seem to think we feel about Biden the way you do about a Trump. Nobody loves Biden. Nobody. They just hate Trump.” I’ve actually shut down a fair number of arguments like that  and that is hard to do. I think it’s because when Obama was “running” for President he did kinda have that cult of personality energy to him with some people. Joe we just didn’t want to hear about what dumb thing he said or did literally everyday. My brain had to push out old dumb shit Trump said to make room for new dumb shit he said or did it was so oftenWow that dude doesn't need to have his job. Especially after saying his last comment until next guest is a real hero. WTF..Lol he said the next guest is a real hero.  The troops are a prop. The second they stray from the propaganda they're tossed aside.Jesus that sure jumped to 11. What a total stooge.He's a bit of a cuntIf you watch newsmax unironically you are a fucking mark.But it’s the left wing media that’s the problem…Let's all go on Newsmax and start calling out Trump. Whoever gets the best reaction wins.Man… fuck drumpft headsAt first I read ""vegetarian guest"".Lmao that's like that vid of the Egyptian Muslim screaming at some poor atheistI’m a right winger and I’ve never even heard of newsmax why do we care what these fringe “news” orgs do since they have almost no real reach and it’s all obviously tribalized??You may have a point about Newsmax their daily viewership is less than half of Steven Crowder who is the leading conservative on YouTube. It's just pretty indicative of a wider trend that did start with Fox News who they are openly trying to emulate.because people watch this religiously and go on to embarrass the country with sunken boat parades and larped insurrectionsWhy are they still sucking his dick and balls?r/CringeNot that I would ever turn on this garbage but wtf…. Sell your soul kind of thing.Even not knowing about anything the host contradict himself. Doesn't let the man finish because they're ""out of time"" then when he gets cut off he starts talking like he has plenty of time giving his point of view to the man he just cut off.No one talks about daddy that way! StapphhhLol. What a bitch. What a way to show your support of veterans.“I just want to shake his hand” energyThis guy does not respect the troops.We all know Trump doesn’t pull out.Fascist does as fascists doIt's just for entertainment. It's not legitimate news.This is theaterWhat a fucking meatheadCowardHe seems like a well adjusted individual.How North KoreanLmao that was hilarious he unleashed the Karen on himWhat a total clownI’ve seen 10 year olds get upset with more decorum than that.“I’m running short on time here” continues to rant for like a solid minute and a half screaming how nobody dare speak ill of the orange oneWhat a f*cking prickWhat a tough guy! Yelling at a vet who can’t hear you is so macho and patriotic!Mask off I guess""God bless you but shut the fuck up.""\s\sLow on time but has plenty of time to be a little shithead. \s\sJust infuriating to watch. What an idiot and a coward.Who cares?Right wingers love pretending like they support the troops until the troops have an opinion that goes against Dear Leader Trump. This clip displays their rank hypocrisy perfectly. Newsmax and OAN are a cancer.Where the fuck is that guys hairline going? Did his forhead say something about Trump?Is it just me or does that guy have a really really small face for the size of his head?  His skull must be SO THICK that it stretches the skin of his head or something.  That face is fucking tiny in relation.This is the first bit of actual news I’ve ever seen on this subredditIt's ironic how this wouldn't have blow up as much if this idiot didn't freak out\s\sGuy tried censoring the veteran only to give him the loudest voice“Where’s my goddamn bottle? Baby hungry!” \s\sThis guy is an absolute chode.He called it on this program that wasn't even a program back then. Yep seems like the same lies that the orange baby spewed.I miss the days when shills realized they didn’t have the moral authority to be indignant.Ahh so Trump is to Blame knew itAh yes cut off the veteran who protects your freedomThis dude has some really small lips....it's so weird watching him talk.Best way to win an argument. Just cut his feed and continue arguing with him as if he was thereIf CNN is fake news what’s this supposed to beWe need to have guidelines on what's considered journalism or propaganda.Fuck this guy lolWow.  he speaks rather clearly for having Trump's nuts gargling in his mouth.Wow totally not a cult at all.This has to be some kind of mental illness right?That was a nice try. But nothing close to classic Bill ""WE'LL DO IT LIVE. "" O'Reilly.Now THAT is the point blank definition of a bitch-ass-ness!Woooow murcaNgl this guy has same energy as a Muslim has with the prophets and trump is far from a prophetOmg!  He is in the qult!  This is scary!Holy FUCK people watch this?? Is this like the far far right news network? At least Fox you can deal with and parse their BS this guy is an absolute nut.never watch news with a guy with a raging hairline recession and screams at veterans   \s\s\seven the headlines at the bottom scream ""don't watch this channel""Wow what a psychoWhat a bitch.This anchor looked incredibly weak. If Trumps actions were so defensible then why the need to immediately shut down any dissenting voices.I respect that you're a veteran but basically shut the fuck up that's what he said.So… not appreciating Donald Trump makes us automatically liberal?  Wow.  This is a bad look for this “freedom loving” cult monger.Thanks for dying for the oil and everything BUT SHUT THE FUCK UO ABOUT MY DADDY TRUMPThat shit went full fascist really quick. Damn...Can we take a moment to laugh at the team being called “Team America.” Fuck yeah!When you get so triggered you censor people. So fucking ironic what a snowflake.What a little bitch!!What a doucheWhat a cunt this is the equivalent of spitting on the face of a vet. 😐Dirt bag""that's not helping anyone!""\s\sAnyone being Trump?\s\sJesus what an asshole.America is in deep deep trouble.How mutch of a coward do you need to be to cute the feed because you don’t even have the stones to yell at him over zoom call? He was not even next to you or anything.This guy is the very definition of a snowflake. All bent out of shape the moment someone contradicts him. He is a big man child like most on the right these days they never matured into adulthood.Imagine… narcissist working in positions of “power” creating their own world to live inPshycoWelcome and remember to subscribe to r/worldnewsvideo!

The First Lady is from Willow Grove PA and my mom is from West Oak Lane section of Philadelphia.  It’s just a few miles away across the county line.  They have similar mannerism and accents.  \s\sI feel like she is could me America’s mom.  Unlike the cold hearted cunt of a trophy wife we had to suffer through the last 4 years.Yeah but where's the pizza?What a sweetheartMeanwhile Ivanka Trump wouldn’t let secret service use one of their six and a half bathroomsI thought that was Ivanka and JaredDr Jill Biden*That is correct.Already has done more than the last First Lady who shall not be namedHopefully not the ones that got Covid.How bad can the new presidential house be?In a few sentences she has shown herself to be so much more gracious and classy then trumpkin and his wife ever have or ever will be.Not like thoes soldiers had a choice in the matterCorrect but it’s not like she was forced to tell them thank you for doing their job... \s\sIt’s like saying thank you to your maintenance guy at an apartment. It’s his job and he has to fix your dirty shit but you say thank you because he did it and your grateful that it happen.

I'm all for Biden but this is literally bare minimum lol. Just because they are not being outright awful like Trump and Melania were doesn't mean they need to be lavished with praise..It is a sweet story and a change is atmospherics.  Why does this small news story about a nice moment bother you so much?It feels like a breath of fresh air. We’ve seen so much bullshit that for me personally it’s nice to see some not bullshit.You chose to make it a big deal buddy who is saying that this is a big deal? These moments are going to happen with or without you watching.  Ok so you watched this video and now you have seen it your response to it is one of slight negativity instead of true neutral. I challenge you to ask yourself why you viewed it the way you did instead of choosing to say cool and move on. For others this is a breath of fresh air coming off the prior administration which clearly lacked a sort of human empathy; for those people who are happy let them enjoy that moment. It is literally week one of a new presidency do you really think it's that outlandish in week one to be happy for a change of direction of a nation? Ask yourself these questions my friend and truly answer them yourself.This “bare minimum” is still more than the previous President or First Lady did.I don't understand why you got downvoted. You're right. We don't need to praise these people for being decent. They're doing what they should be doing and what we should be doing. That's called being respectful. There's no reason to put the Bidens on a pedestal. I guess people really have no desire to learn from history.""Welcome and remember to subscribe to r/worldnewsvideo!

Like I’m in Washington state but I support this dude for senate.AbsolutelyNew blood alone won’t do shit. You guys need educated new blood.The democrats control the House the Senate and the Presidency. They can easily get this passed with bipartisan support considering most republicans support legalization of weed as well.

Dude needs to be the fuckin president.I would love to see this dude sit on the desk in the Oval Office strike up a fatty.Has us in the first half.Most presidents are representatives first.

She didn’t get caught immediately but she was arrested over a month later when they spotted her. It sucks because even though she hasn’t been convicted of anything no employer will give her a job because she has pending charges. Like do you understand how sick that is?

The sad thing is person running against him probably sucks too because lousiana puts up shit fucking RINO republicans.As happy as I am that things are getting progressive in terms of marijuana I hate the glorification of the smoking. Mainly because I'm highly allergic to the smoke. I could care less if you were consuming it in any other form that doesn't affect me when I happen to just walk by but smoking (tobacco any anything else) is just disgusting especially around other people without regard for their health.What elected democrats are making efforts to legalize that have ran with the promise of legalizing?This guy says one thing and people are acting like he should be the next President.

I know this because I remember some commercial from the 90’s telling me that!  Cowabunga dudes!”The weed ""agenda"" that he's making a point for is objectively good and American. Think of it like this weed doesn't make someone a loser but losers are attracted to it. Just like guns don't kill people people kill people. Guns just make it easier.

Yeah... uh the cops they were in on it or something... Especially the dead cop he was definitely in on it the sneaky bastard. Wait cops are good or bad I forgot the narrative you guys have at the moment. Or were they antifa too? Fighting *for* fascism instead of against it yeah! Just to confuse us!

Me think real good and I'm constantly angry at the world but can't understand why!\s\sThe reason they didn't get the national guard in earlier dude was cause *Trump held them back.* You know he wanted things f'd up to try to keep in power. You know it we all know it trump knows it. The whole world knows it. So stop pretending. Give it up. Trump was and is a traitor to your country.Why did GOP leadership in the house and senate say Trump was responsible?Wait. They opened the doors? Why are there like 300 streams of people having pitch battles with ""back the blue"" capitol police? Like we all saw them call cops traitors and cowards and try and murder the police. With our own eyes.LOL look at this fucking clown. Yeah we live in a clown world alright. And you're one of the clown pawns.It was staged?? This would be hilarious if it wasn't so detrimental. Gtfoh.Every single one of them lives in the constant lies they tell themselves.What HogsThick as pigshitHmm never heard that one before thank you for expanding my “this is bullshit” vocabulary.Wild how these Trumpers will twist and bend the truth - actual recorded facts - to fit their logic and suit their agenda. \s\sI feel like we just need an asteroid to obliterate man kind so we can start all over. From single celled organisms. Maybe then we'll get it right. Maybe.I'm still salty about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. So I can't agree with obliterating mankind unless....Doubt itCognitive dissonance is a helluva drug.Since the government has not charged anyone from antifa it must mean they are all in it. Police FBI NSA you name it they are all in it that is a proof of a conspiracy. How else could antifa done it when you have thousands of witnesses who only stormed the capitol stealing stuff reading papers breaking windows beating cops trying to overturn an election because they had to protect the nation from antifa breaking into the capitol and stealing stuff reading papers breaking windows beating cops trying to overturn an election for Trump.

Guess what is the main defense when their theories are incompatible with reality? Everything is controlled by Satan so all you hear is lies and the only true source is the one that agrees with us.  \s\s\sIt is a cult a loose cult but cult nonetheless..I'm glad you got out of JW!

Go find his son and arrest him.probably has been and his lawyers advice to him and his family to not say anything that 100% confirms he was there.

I wasn't sure what he did to deserve Penny giving him such a huge ass whopping but damn this video explained it all to me in just a matter of a few seconds.""I think we can have a respectful conversation"" yeah it starts with you shutting up when other people are talking.His “there there” tone is so beyond infuriating that I have to wonder if it’s deliberate.Jesus. Australian parliament is no joke.It’s brutal. Every member speaks every speech in fluent bogan so us apes can understand.The LNP sure do treat it like a joke though. [Example.](https://youtu.be/9GeIEDf_NVI)A few other countries could learn by example.I understand they have a lawn right up the roof of the building based on the idea that people ought to be able to walk all over their government.  It might just be a symbol but it is a much better symbol than a militant eagle or towers of white marble.No it is a joke.\s\sPenny Wong isn't a joke however.Yeah mate the prime Minister even has to participate is awesomeJust look up Orange County’s Democratic congresswoman Katie Porters greatest hits on YouTube. That woman is amazing in her take downs.The only thing she didn’t do was call him a cunt. Wish she didYes it is. Labor is so busy pretending not to be Liberal that they've forgotten to actually not be Liberal and Murdoch propaganda had ruined any chance of a Greens majority so we're stuck with a pack of corrupt liars with no shame as seen. \s\sI weep for the future of this country.Well yeah they get all the jokes out when actually administering the government. (This is a Labour senator the current opposition party not the ones in charge.)It's great to have it called like it is sometimes. Free speech everywhere.Except the results are. If they weren't a US ally we'd all be outraged at their repressive policies. Link taxes surveillance state encryption backdoors etc.I wish the US congress could directly address members like thisSeems to me they do although it's clearly not as embraced as in Australian and British chambers. In America members step up to address the speaker and they then talk about issues and other congress people... who may not even be there.People have referred to each other as cunts before. They got told off.proselytize is a word I’ve never heard before. Vocab word!Can't they solve it by a booting?Fucking wish we could.

Several bits. Hope that helps.BOOM ROASTED!I instantly like this Penny Wong. She badass.my god this lady is legendaryShe's awesome 🥰All over the world it seems like this are we ready?America needs to adopt this legislative procedure. Cspans ratings will torch the super bowl.This Penny Wong is torching the guy over what seems to be a legitimate but insignificant error. In America IMO we need our Penny Wongs to call out lies deliberate deception and obfuscation. This is the crap that pollutes American law IMO.I really wish we could have this in America.  but whatever party in power gets to cut people off for being ""uncivil""Why isn't this person running our country?Because senators don’t get elected to run the country members of parliament doCos she's doing a good job of holding the Senate where she is. Moving her to Parliament would mean losing the Labor party's best piece in the Senate.Penny Wong is pretty pro-china. She is also responsible for the Gillard-era 'budget blowout' the current government loves to post about (regardless how well THEY are doing/not doing).\s\sShes also a Lesbian and Asian. No way she is getting to be PM in Australia too many racist old men in power there still.I don't know what country you refer to; however in my country there are already many politicians who spend time insulting other politicians personally devoting their time to ad hominem attack. I can't say this has improved anything.She’s AMAZING!!!what is going on? ELI5Ben small is being a tool that hasn't caught up with the shit that's going and doesn't know the details of the what he is talking about and penny Wong is ripping his ass open for itSooo what are they talking about?Good for her. This kind of incompetence deserves ridicule.\s\sI hope she made him feel small.Really? Are you happy with yourse- get out!Penny Wong for PM.That’s only gonna work if we kick out all the xenophobic white men from government which is about 80% of it so as much as I agree with your statement I don’t think it will ever happenHoly shit honorable speaker i would like to report a cold blooded murder please.Fuck yeah penny wongThis government is such a fucking joke Murdoch has rotted the minds of Australians. People prefer happy lies over sad truths.Can anyone ELI5 the bill she’s talking about?That does not look like a functional government either.![gif](giphy|pQmWjYrz39YAg)Jesus Christ. I wish my country did politics like this. I’d probably watch CSPAN and even if shit still didn’t get done I’d at least enjoy watchingSo the whole thing is exposing and shaming a mistake by a colleague. Slightly sociapathic this.![gif](giphy|KCRlomzxILgofqokqH)[deleted]That’s helps.She talks like she’s trying to get a joke in at a table full of loud talkersWell it is AustraliaIt basically is. They all just yell at eachother. A lot to the time It is orderly but when shit like this goes down it becomes the loudest is the most correct.You need to get loud in parliament so all your ministers can yell ""here here""that seems to be half of what government entails tbh[removed]Can you imagine being as unfunny as this guy lmaoY thoSo cleverI like this ladyI would pay to watch her do that to Mitch McConnell lolJesus Christ I get people hate the turtle but unleashing Penny Wong (half Malay Chinese half Australian 100% socialist conservative destroying dyke) on him would probably violate many parts of the Geneva Convention.Welcome and remember to subscribe to r/worldnewsvideo!

Given the recent killing of that Afghani aid worker distributing barrels of water and the military patting itself on the back until NY Times reported otherwise I believe our military intelligence is far from infallible.A lot of Redditers were just little kids or not even born back then but as someone who was an adult everyone with half a brain and the most basic knowledge of the Middle East knew it was a lie at the time.

Bitch costed so many lives in Iraq.  May he reap what he saw.Colin Powell also declined to attend the 2001 UN conference against racism.\s\s[He explained the specific reason being the inclusion of the charge of apartheid against Israel among other such criticism.](https://imgur.com/a/TBvzb47) \s\sClearly he was following orders from the Bush administration - who in-turn were lobbied hard to not attend. Powell was a company man through and through.\s\s20 years later most Middle East experts agree that Israel is an apartheid State and as well as the consensus amongst human rights groups the UN and the South African government.You can tell that George Tenet behind Powell knew it was all a lie. I wonder if they lied to Powell and convinced him of the lie so that he would lie with sincerity. It's a common technique.From what I've seen that's what happened or he finally gave in to their pressure because he supposedly was against the war and needed convincing to begin with.He was secretary of state. There is nothing going on he didnt know about.It has been established that Powell was lied to and the head of the CIA apologized later.Rest in Piss.Blood no longer drips from the fingers of this war criminalHe was celebrated. One day Americans will learn at a politicians level they don’t care. They only care that we under them spend our energy on infighting. So much of what he said was a flat out lie. And he knew it. He should never be allowed to run for public office and have his \sClearance revoked. He alone effectively murdered thousands with just simple words. \s\sBtw… yes white brown any color politician \sIs nothing more than a accomplished liar a manipulator.Good riddanceSo we gonna blame the black man?Why make this a race thing?  Powell GWB Cheney the whole lot of them are equally culpable.  They knew what they were doing and did it anyways.  Skin color has nothing to do with moral depravity.his color has nothing to do with his crimes.If there's a hell I hope he's rotting there now.  \s\sMillions of lives ruined all because we ~~needed~~ wanted more oil.Well there probably isn't a hell but if it's any consolation to you he's fucking dead now.I always hear people say they did it for oil but how true is this?

Looking at the current oil production I see that the US has remained as one of the top oil producers in the world for a while now and is currently sitting at number one due to fracking and other advancements in technology.I hope he is reincarnated as a Muslim in Palestine so he can see what our tax dollars do to help destroy peoples lives in our namehe also cost the lives of 4000 American and nato personnel and over 17000 lives in the iraqi security forcesI dOnT NeEd to wEar a SeAtbelt wHile DrivING I TrUSt mY SKeLEton!Welcome and remember to subscribe to r/worldnewsvideo!

He’s worse than I thought.u/savevideoOn what planet is it white supremacy to state the indisputable fact that not all cultures are equal? The guy *may* be the worst person on Earth but if he is then why not quote him *actually* saying awful things? If you believe that all cultures are equally good then let me know the sense in which the conservative culture of Pakistan is equally as good as the liberal culture of Denmark for example. Let's have a discussion.His schtick is to phrase things so they sound like a simple mundane obvious facts when taken in isolation while in context that's not the takeaway from his target audience. His trite truisms are intentionally designed to validate and fan the flames of their conspiratorial xenophobic theories.The Western culture that Tucker touts as superior relies on the enlightenment ethics which led to the ideals of universal suffrage and the ability to accept all points of view as long as they do no harm to others. So I think I think it’s fair to judge other cultures in those instances where people are harmed on account of cultural practice. And many barbaric inhumane practices are rightlfully condemned such as female genital mutilation widow burning dowry burning stoning and honour killing. \s\sThere’s a number of important things to consider however - if we are to take the position of judge then we must judge all behaviour by the same standards. So if Tucker Carlson is going to condemn other cultures for being sexist or repressive or racist then he must also root that behaviour out in his own culture. Since much of the Enlightenment’s ethics were based on Kant’s categorical imperative that if something is wrong or right it must be so in all instances. \s\sSecondly beyond those clear instances in which harm is done to others through cultural practices it is ridiculous to suggest that cultures can be ranked as good or bad.  In the first place culture is fluid and amorphous. So the very idea of saying “this” culture beyond the broadest terms is impossible given that - for example -  a young Australian woman living in an inner city suburb on the urban coast will have entirely different values to an older Australian male living in the rural centre. Just as a Pakistani coder living most of his life online in Islamabad is going to have very different values to a tribal elder in Balochistan.\s\sWhich brings us to the final brief point in a very complex discussion - culture is lived. Generally speaking a Sikh  is happier being a Sikh than not being one. And if he was not happy with that experience then maybe he chooses to leave. So the fact that you are happy in the west as a westerner is entirely unsurprising. And it’s also not surprising that you tout your culture as the best. Much the same as most dominant cultures do - the same as Alexander did Caesar the Moorish Caliphate the Ottomans Britain’s empire and China’s wolf warriors right now.  But cultural dominance comes and goes - so is it truly a measure of what is best? Or simply who is more powerful? And if you take a look at the ethics of American imperial power. Which is the basis of your affluence and privilege- that’s not a good culture - in truth it’s an evil culture. So - is it really the best culture? Or simply the most powerful?When the only culture you acknowledge to have merit and be above all others is a white culture.Well Denmark may no longer be the best choice but yeah I was gonna say thisI love how you invite a debate and then start blocking people.  Such a perfect example of the conservative fascist.  Fuck yourself.[deleted]u/savevideoSo.. after never watching this show does Tucker Carlson ask ""What is -insert horrible thing-"" then proceed to explain ""exactly"" what that thing is so viewers at home can be like ""YEAH! I'M NOT THAT THING I ONLY HATE -???-""What a malignant disinformation spewing cancer on society that piece of human garbage is.Well put. +500 pointsthat's his goal too.u/savevideoThis is so well madewow just ... wowBrilliant  😂[deleted]Our interests rarely ever align most rich people including elon musk are redundant.

He's on the podcast Worst Year Ever too. Which is very similar. It's the love child of Even More News and Behind the Bastards.Also Cody and Katie are regular guests on Behind the Bastards which I highly recommend.You got it backwards the YouTube channel is [Some More News](https://youtube.com/channel/UCvlj0IzjSnNoduQF0l3VGng) and the podcast is [Even More News](https://link.chtbl.com/EMN_145). Here's the link to the episode about Musk: https://youtu.be/5pNL7MlUpmII’m not mad at the kid I’m mad at his parents for being pieces of shit and teaching him stuff like that including the racist catch phrase “it was over states rights not slavery!”That kid gave me so much hope for the future.A post worth saving..... And that's coming from someone that used to embrace the Confederate Flag. But one day I realized it was a matter of association and the company I kept not because I agreed with any of the ideals behind it. When I joined the Army's delayed entry program I pointed out to my friends and some members of my family that it represented soldiers that would have been trying to kill me for the uniform I was about to put on. It may not have been the offical Confederate Flag but in the intervening years it had come to represent an enemy nation that was responsible for the deaths of 360000 that fought for the United States of America and to represent ideals that have no place in the United States of America.Username checks out.doesn't this mean its ok to embrace the flag since its just a battle flag tho?The flag that everyone thinks of isn’t even the official flag it’s the battle flagYes he said that exact thing in the video.That young man Fucks.That sophomore kid owned that senior hahaAs a small addition to what the kid was saying slavery wasn't even something the South skirted around by saying ""states rights"" it was very explicit. Alexander Stephens Vice President of the Confederacy gave a [speech](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/cornerstone-speech) in which he explicitly states ""The new constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.""He owned him like the south liked to own slaves...

Scumbag neo nazi sack of shit.This video is 5 years old. No doubt half the people there are flying those flags fully erect screaming I told you so.as someone else stated just because he approved the flag doesn’t mean 100% he was a neo nazi. racist maybe but not a neo nazi. he was most likely parroting something his parents have been saying since he was like 12 so it’s ingrained in his brainApparently Chris is now majoring in Political Science. No update on Drake which seems fitting because most of the confederate assholes will be forgotten in time.Good ol’ Chris.Did you only look for 2 minutes? He’s doing fine.He's talking about his teachers being biased when he literally let him say everything he wanted to say. Without that teacher that debate wouldn't even be possible.\sAnd I heard everything and all his opinions but the fact of the matter is it's linked to slavery. You can't pick and choose what parts you want to keep and what parts you want to get rid of even though most of us do that right now with the American flag. The fact of the matter is these people know why they're flying the flag they know it offends other people and they don't care and they're going to keep doing it. It's not illegal to be ignorant it's not illegal to be a jerk and it's not illegal to be offensive or wait maybe it is? Even though most people who are willing to fly the Confederate flag argue that hate speech is not real lolOmg this was my middle school social studies teacher!

Frankly its the message the flag sends that wrongs and by being allowed to fly it we're telling others who can see it that its ok that this was a part of our history ""dont be ashamed of the slave driving terrorist you once were!(maybe still are but its ok!)""\s\sits not ok.\s\swhy do you think anything Nazi party affiliated in Germany is highly illegal? That was a shit stain on Germany's public permanent record and they're frightfully ashamed of it. Should any part of their nation outside of approved historical museums be allowed to display such a flag would suggest that Germany is aware of their past they're not ashamed of it and its ok and by suggesting its OK opens the gate for allowing that mentality to come back and risk another similar party of the same values. Its not ok. Germany knows that. America on the other hand is such a large nation more divided than most realize too many of our people are not ashamed of our past that they feel its OK to wave this flag in any place public or private. its not ok.He answered the original question in his first few seconds of talking. He just wanted to disagree that it wasn’t a racial thing.Good shit ChrisGet rolledPlot twist.

I guess you blame COVID deaths on Biden too. Can we put responsibility on Biden for any stock market gains during his presidency so far? GameStonk for the win.LIES DETECTOR ACTIVATED.  \sThose were not already created jobs but jobs who were intended to be created. Biden canceled a project but that money still can be put on another project which will eventually create jobs too.Ah yes of course “Biden’s President let’s shut down all business” said them all Holy shit you are stupidIf you are referring to the Keystone pipeline then no they weren't. Those were projected jobs only 10 of which were permanent and almost all of those jobs would be Canadian.For a pipeline to cause more environmental issues? Hmm maybe that's a fair trade.

This is will make heads explode on the Right.Love it but who can't vote?This is the kinda person we need in the White House.\s\sSo long as he keeps his teeth sharp we just might just get that in a few years.anyone know where I can find more information on his priorities and opinions? I looked on his website but I couldn't find much of anything.Hell of a guy he’d get my vote.This guy fucks.Burn it down!!! This man has the right idea“I believe the south will rise again this time it’ll be on our terms!” As someone from the south that believes in the spirit of the south this was goddamn powerful and I absolutely love it!That felt sooo fucking goood.o7 Beautiful.This guy is absolutely based. Mad respectHells yeah!  I may send some coin to his campaign.This guy fucking gets it.\s\sNow I need to research his policy stances and proposals.This dudes greatShoot ID vote for him.

Wish I could vote for this guy so fucking much instead of the unopposed ""Hitler got one thing right"" rep I have to deal with. Nothing to do with gerrymandered districts though that so many in Congress run unopposed...Let the race war commence full time. The white power is gonna raaaage. Then again so are the african american. Tbh I dont see much meaning to the people who have that kinda flag and being so proud to just admit they are on equal level as nazi party's are. \sIt doesnt even represent america. It represents a bad side of what you had in america. I guess if somethings gonna come back from the old days. How about a casual hanging but this time do white people who support this kinda flag? Alittle payback from history where it was so casual to hang a slave was a norm. Why not whites?BasedIt's so hot 🔥Why do American Political adverts have ""My name is.. and I approve of this message"" at the end of them?\s\sAlso it is kinda weird to allow them to advertise like that but then that's a different issue.To your first question it's because of the [Stand By Your Ad Provision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_by_Your_Ad_provision):\s\s> ...enacted in 2002 requires candidates in the United States for federal political office as well as interest groups and political parties supporting or opposing a candidate to include in political advertisments on television and radio ""a statement by the candidate that identifies the candidate and states that the candidate has approved the communication"". The provision was intended to force political candidates running any campaign for office in the United States to associate themselves with their television and radio advertising thereby discouraging them from making controversial claims or attack ads.\s\sAnd the only flag that be could potentially get in trouble for burning is the American flag though that has been brought before the Supreme Court several times as a matter of free speech.Straight up porn right thereHold on moving to Louisiana to vote for this guy.  \s\s\sBetter yet let's start movements in every state just like this one and vote these people into office.AgreedThis.

Literally go to any poor neighborhood including white neighborhoods and crime is rampant.\s\sBlack on black crime is not a thing.

This guy speaks the raw truth. Unfortunately back in the day Louisiana was among the most (if not #1) frequent locations for racial violence eg lynchings. Everyone talks about Mississippi Burning but I would argue Deacons for Defense is a stronger depiction of the racial violence in the South.I hope he wins.Anyone else get samcap vibes?Dumb question from a non US citizen. Why does he say ""I'm Gary Chambers and I approve of this message""? If he is Gary Chambers and he is speaking wouldn't that automatically make that an ""approved by himself"" message? Or is there a way to say something that isn't approved by yourself?A lot of political ads in America are made by people other than the person they are advertising. A lot of the times they’re made by local political groups. The worst attack ads or really sensationalist ads are usually not made by the candidates themselves so ads that are actually made by the campaign always say they’re actually made by the person. Ones made by other random people usually end in saying the group that paid for it like “paid for by illinois democrats for biden” or something along those lines. If you’ve ever seen a really wacky American political commercial that accuses the other person of eating babies or some shit it almost certainly wasn’t actually made by the candidate.It's not a real flag anymore so who cares?I just wonder what the response of Republicans are.\s\sBecause I love this and want to have a massive tea spilling session from laughing too hardThis guy fucksI hope he gets the votes he needsVote him for the love of GODGeneral William Tecumseh Sherman would approve of this![gif](giphy|1SfxXOJ0Q2Xni)Politics is the new cinemaChadDefinitely getting my absentee ballot in for Louisiana this November for that man aloneThis New Engender wishes he could vote for this guyWait isnt burning a flag respect?Are you trying to find an excuse to make the confederacy ok?Not like that it isn’tthat's the point. it's a white supremacist flag.Based af.Running for LA senate with that video?

He has no chance getting support from the Democratic establishmentThat’s a bold statement there boy … you have my vote!!!“Boy”?Now if you put the Foghorn Leghorn voice on that it works.This makes me actually patrioticIgnorant hater looking for excuses.His hate isn't ignorant it's justified. Go to hell you fucking Confederate simp.Ratioself admitted racist niceMald harderYou literally are a fan of Steven Crowder STFUThis guy is bad ass. Hey Republicans don’t close your eyes cause this guy is coming for you. If only all Dems/progressives had the balls this guy has instead of continuing to “reach out” to fascists.Voting for democrats feels like voting for Charlie Brown. You know when he's being set up by Lucy to kick the ball? The Republicans ""pull the ball"" every time and Democrats fall for it.....every time. Yet they still feel like compromise is necessary Ffs.*cough cough*Unfortunately “centrist” democrats and republicans are simply different wings of the same bird and that birds name is “Corporate $$$”. The constant compromising so that “nothing will fundamentally change” is built by design.Come on we have to understand where they are coming from! 🤣Ya all realize that the Republicans were the Unionists in the Civil War right?If they had such balls then they would not be called dems.He's running in Louisiana. If he doesn't reach out to some far right people he might not win.That's amazing. I'd vote for him if I lived in LouisianaThis guy is hard make him presidentI want to see him light a blunt with a confederate flag!Gary Chambers is great!Rag Burning is perfectly legal. \s\sWhat's the issue?Conservatives are gonna love thisI’m sorry but the South most definitely will not rise again.Why not?  States like Louisiana have two to three times the national average of black residents.  You don’t want to see them rise?   \s\sMaya Angelou is smh her head right now.holy shit what a fucking chadNo thanks! My money says he won’t winWould love to see him up against Republicans.He has already lost local elections.Thats not the confederate flag though.\sI'm not even American and I know this is the Dixie flag.Yeah that's the Confederate battle flag. But here in the states it's more connected to the Confederacy than the actual official Confederate flag. Burning it is much more of a bold statement than burning the official one.Its the confederate flag to the traitorous mouth breathing sister fucker party.Hate to break it to ya but Dems set up all the gerrymandering and the confederacy and Jim Crow. And it’s also the Dems that keep African Americans in poverty today. If you don’t believe me why did Biden literally spend $30 million on crack pipes for black people. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. There are laws literally designed to break apart the black nuclear family which perpetuates a cycle of single parent households whose kids overwhelmingly end up joining gangs committing crimes and ending up in prison. It’s a cycle that will only get worse until we address the root cause. And it just makes me sad to see peoples’ very justified anger and resentment being directed towards the wrong people only to be taken advantage of by the same people that put them in that position in the first place.Hate to break it to ya but gerrymandering confederacy and jim crow were all created by conservatives. Back then it wasn't Dems vs Republicans. It was liberals vs Conservatives. You can see that by the way they voted.\s\sSecondly the poorest states are red states. One study examining the last few decades found that black americans do far better economically under Democrats than Republicans.\s\sThird the crack pipes thing isn't real. A quick google search would have shown you that. And even the narrative around it didnt say it was for black people.BasedBased✊🏽 I don’t know who this man is but I’m sold! ✊🏽 Gary Chambers!I'm sorry to say but what about us Hispanics? We also deal with the same shit. But we are in the void about it all. If you want an example. See how trump put Hispanic children in cages and also how he parden the cop from arizona who put Hispanics in he own prison. \s\sIf you truly want freedom. You have to help everyone of color.

This revolution will be televised.Well doneAbsolute king. Hope he winsWe need more politicians like this. Politicians that have lived what their constituents have experienced and that don’t come from elite/upperclass backgrounds. \s\sNo change happens when politicians are able to avoid the daily obstacles the average person experiences because they often lack the empathy to think past themselves. So many politicians have this shitty mentality of “well I’m not worried about x because it doesn’t affect me so I’m not going to vote for y which would actually help the people who voted for me”. This guy seems to have a realistic view of what it’s actually  like the be the constituent rather than the politician.This is a fucking awesome adI like this guy.

Please helpSo back in July he told reporters he had a special ring tone for Trump. And that ring tone played when that call came in.

And if you watch the full video you can see the sincerity in the host. Even though the conversation was about hate there was nothing but love in that room.Are you f ing high. This video could've been made last week when schools were segregated and I would be questioned for having a black friend. Again are you f ing high.

Truly timeless and inspirationalIt never occurred to me that foreign exchange students are required to pledge allegiance to a country that is not their own.No one is required to.  Just heavily pressured.They’re…..not. At least not in private schools.[deleted]Back in 1976 with all the bicentennial celebrations it was common to fly the Betsy Ross flag. It didn’t mean anything racist. Now if you fly it it’s intentional and signifies white supremacy.There is still a bit of racism sexism and whatever else in the United States but the biggest problem is the terrorist attacks the United States keeps on committing against other countries. Iraq dropped over 600000 bombs to kill one person who lead Iraq to greatness and was loved by the Iraqi people. Syria funded terrorist groups and tried to over through a dictatorship that was heavily supported by the Syrian people. Iran sanctioned thier economy to hell for refusing to be America's bitch like Israel. Afghanistan supported a very corrupt and useless goverment. Yemen kept selling weapons to the Saudis and covering for Saudi Arabia when ever they killed innocent people in Yemen. Palestine has funded apartheid and sold weapons that killed 10s of thousands of Palestinians most of which were very young. Turkey kept treating Turkey as a lesser and pushed them away little by little and now blaming then for starting to side with the Russians. \s\sAnd overall that still not a single American has actually took a stand against the terrorist attacks the United States has been committing since its founding. \s\sAmerica is undoubtedly the worst nation on Earth with the most oblivious careless and selfish people on the planet.Damn these people ought to be 80-90yo by now.\s\sHoe nice to see how little has changed in nearly a centuryDecades later and much of it still hasnt changedI often daydream of the things we could accomplish if we all just work togetherI wouldn't go that farNothing's changed just like those other videos of Philippino kids experience in Japan and China then and now hate hate hate shame shame shameAs a non-American I feel that these sentiments still ring true today. The Pledge of Allegiance is still recited yet a blatant racist misogynist and xenophobe like Donald Trump was still elected president.I've always felt like there was something wrong about forcing kids to do the 'pledge of allegiance'...just a reminder that Donald lost the popular vote twice in a row - the only reason he was president at all was due to the electoral college.I thought pretty much every country’s preamble to constitution mention equality and freedom. And no country is immune to racist politicians getting electedDamn. It only took scrolling down to one comment to see someone mention Donald Trump. My fucking God I pray for a day I can finally stop fucking hearing about Trump every five seconds.Donald Trump is literally worse than Hitler for all the evil he introduced into the world.Wait he was a misogynist to?[removed]Oh yeah our dances are still the same no mixing of colors and separate fountains and all. LmfaoAll very well spoken. Also im gonna saying the word crossed. Good word to used when your confused.Crossed means you smoked weed and drank alcohol together in most parts of the US I’d avoid it lolDamn this is good such class[deleted]Fuck me these guys can speak.My Man Speaking FAXWell now we get to see racism recorded on peoples phones EVERY SINGLE DAY and still nothing gets done.People are still in denial or call themselves oppressed for being racistAhhh 1950s in the USA.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sWhere they loved Jesus more than they hated non-whitesi keep seeing this post reposted every few weeks""Gives a sort of nasty shock when you come up against it face to face you read about it in the newspapers hear about it but you don't really realise the significance of it until it hits you in the face yourself""She's completely right unless they see it happening to they I see that people tend to sort of isolate themselves from situations in my opinion. Shocking how people still feel the need to be prejudiced this video is 70 odd years old and still relevant today unfortunatelyI feel that a lot of foreigners still have this attitude. It's a very common thing to hear ""why are Americans always talking about race? Surely it's not *that* bad"". And there are people wanting to come over to US and think ""Oh there's racism sure but I'll manage fine"".Shocking to realize it’s presence maddening to be subjected to it persistently since the sixteen hundreds. How many generations will fit in the time span of 100 years. What will it do to you and your father? What does it really mean for your  mother and sisters who must enter the  hives of such madness to maintain and clean them alone every day for hundreds of years. All those magnificent homes adorn the south. Guess who were forced to build them? Why? How?? John Herschel invented blueprints in the mid 1800’s?? It was not until 1902 that the word Racism was ever used. Oh yeah how come few people have ever even sought to define the true meaning of the word but they use it lean on it and depend on that single word like a Lucky Rabbits Foot.Sauce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-taJf2Ks6U[removed]you're a cunt.lol I'm sure you're quite the lookerRude and not funny.He’s rightThe US blood lust after the attack was abhorrent. US started two wars with countries that nothing to do with the attacks.  20 years after starting 2 wars they are still suffering the fallout. I am an American and was alive when the wars started and I am complicit in this.I hope these words echo forever in GWB's ears when he tries to sleep.Don’t let Trump’s egotistical idiocy fool people into rehabilitating George W. Bush’s image. Bush is a warmonger who started an unnecessary war.True hero right there.Agreed. Shoulda thrown his shoes at him tho.I feel bad. Nobody wins in a war.Not really. He happily shot at iraqis first.He’s right.george michael has really grown up.Just more evidence that how politicians and their stans feel about veterans is performative at bestDid you notice how people stopped booing him once he said 1 MILLION IRAQIS ARE DEAD because he lied about WMD's?  This shit needs to go viral.They all know it's the truth but rather stay silent/look the other way cause of the precious tax breaks the party brings them.>the reason the US went to war with Iraq was because he claimed they had WMDs?(born after 2001)Anyone supporting W at this point knows that he’s a scum bag. They’ve just chosen to not care. So honestly fuck them too.We went to Iraq even though the terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. That's so weird.It's not weird if you know why they went to war in the first place: it wasn't about combating terrorism at all. Bush went to war with Iraq because the Saudi regime is already very agreeable to US interests in the region whereas Iraq was not. This is why they toppled Saddam Hussein in order to establish a puppet regime that gave away oil contracts to the imperialist powers that occupy the region to this day. It's all about making money for a handful of extremely rich and powerful people.So much for freedom of speech…1 million iraqi is dead can be solved by saying sorry?? He must go to jail for lifeThe whole bush family should be in jail.

Letting all of these “leaders” live out comfy lives spending rotten money from their lifelong devotion to exploitation and violence after they’ve wrecked the lives of millions of innocent needs to be interrupted. They need to be held to account and have the nightmares of their victims imprinted on their coward psyches.should have thrown your shoes at himhero[deleted]Notice it was in Beverly hills. None of those people went to war they are all extremely wealthy. Their reality is different than ours.The people booing are privileged Americans who have no idea of the suffering George W. Bush caused in Iraq and Afghanistan. They don't care about the exploited victims of the military industrial complex the people Bush had tortured.it's America\s\s justice is not blind but stupidGood. Bush literally got away with murder. \s\sAs someone from the Middle East I’m genuinely touched he mentioned lost Iraqi souls alongside his war vets. Sometimes the 100000s of people that died in the region is an afterthought.Unlike the US soldiers who died in this war Iraqi civilians never chose to go to war in the first place. I understand not every US soldier goes there because they want to go either they mostly tend to join the US military because of a desperate financial situation as Mike Prysner the same guy from the video explains in [this amazing speech](https://youtu.be/mVXYH9tRknc). We are all enemies to the imperialist regime.Listen to those true patriots booing a veteran. You couldn’t make this shit up.They especially hate it when vets speak uncomfortable truths. I’m not as bold as this guy but I’ll tell ya what I lost most of my vet (former) friends when I supported NoDAPL. Next thing ya know I had rando FB boomers doxxing me at my job and accusing me of stolen valor etc. I’m convinced there is nothing right wingers hate more than a lefty veteran.pieces of shitto be fair they stopped booing soon after they realized he was speaking facts. should’ve applauded him I hope there’s video of George bush on stage while the guy shouted this. I’d love to see his reaction and possibly a response.I suspect it the same vacant confused look he's always   hadIt’s amazing to see all the dumbass liberals praise Bush and his cronies (Nicolle Wallace Comey Mueller Rumsfeld Jon Bolton Condolezza Rice Colin Powell) during Trumps administration they all lied us into war with Iraq. They should all be brought up on treason charges as well as war crimes. All this because liberals have Trump derangement syndrome which allowed these terrible people to white wash their own crimes and they some how think Trump (as bad as he was) is worse than any of these people is just laughable. People have very short memories.I actually agree with you. Trump is a fascist and a terrible person but this doesn't make Bush Obama or Biden necessarily better than him. All of them are war criminals who should be tried for crimes against humanity.Feels like this man has been ignored for a while.  Hope he is doing alright today.Isn’t this Michael Prysner? If so he’s still an ongoing activist to this day fighting the good fightWell I don’t think he lied on purpose. He regurgitated what Cheney and the CIA told him. This guy is 100% correct in his rage but it’s probably misdirected. Still good to get people talking about itYou're being way too gullible. He knew exactly what he was doing. Even if the CIA was correct about WMD it still wouldn't have made any sense to invade a country for its own wellbeing. Bush never cared at all about the Iraqi people either way. Bush has always only cared about his donations.Glad they got a taste of reality bless this manThe current president of the United States knew that the weapons of mass destruction narrative was a lie but he went along with it anyways because he thought war in Iraq was a good idea.\s\sBush and Biden have a number of similarities another is that Biden brags about his contributions to the patriot act one of Bush's most controversial moves. So yeah everything this man is yelling about was also supported by the current president.>but he went along with it anyways because he thought war in Iraq was a good idea.\s\s""Good idea"" for who that is? I agree the GWB thought going to war was a ""good idea"" for him and his donors but I am sure he did not believe it would actually be good for the average people of his country and definitely not for the people of Iraq. GWB was not stupid he did exactly what US presidents are supposed to do: serve the interests of capital.\s\sAnd yes this means Biden is also terrible just like every other US president in a very long time.I'm curious to know as a european how much americans would actually support this dude or people like him? Would majority of americans agree on what he stated?Everyone that I know 100% agrees with this man shouting. But then again I'm in a blue stateFuck yea. This guy is da champ. Saying what most vets would want to say but wouldn’t have to cajones to actually go through with it. Guarantee he got his ass kicked by the secret service afterward tho.everything Bush does would just be so much more charming if it were done in a prison cell in the HagueSome people did something right?Damn that dudes the real heroBush is a POSFuck every motherfucking fucker who boo-ed him. Fuck them hard with a red hot railroad spike.Btw this guy would be called a “tankie” by most of y’all. He’s a PSL memberLol he wanted to be arrested so bad. George bush had shoes thrown at him mid conference he’s used to this stuff. I don’t know why people are going back to George Bush now considering he’s pretty anti-trump and actually participated in events with our other presidents. Wasn’t a great president but definitely no where near the worstMaybe because he's the one who started a decades long illegal war on the premise of imaginary WMDs and connections to 9/11 instead of the Saudis who actually funded the attack. He is directly responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.\s\s  \s\s\s  \s\s\sAnti-45 or not that doesn't make you a good person.You'll say the same thing about trump in a few years when his image is rehabilitated.Try saying this once your country gets invaded. I literally have never even seen my home because of Bush.[deleted]Aren’t they married? What a power coupleShe was on RT and is a truther.

It was always there worldwide across the board he just moved it from inside to outside voices. When your first words as country leader are ""Mexicans are rapists and murderers"" you set the mood for the rest of term in office.The orange asshat gave all the deplorables permission to say the quiet part out loud and then encouraged others to join in by pushing the us vs. them/enemy of the people narrative.  I'd like to believe the majority of Americans aren't racists and bigots but I just don't know any more.  Wtf?Bohbert would be visiting HR at any midsized business in America…and be written up!Fired at manyAt any business in America Omar could sue and would likely get quite a bit of moneyI’ve read that drone pilots exhibit PSTD similar to that of foot soldiers.

They now have AfriCom thanks to Obama. Wouldn’t get approval from Bush for whatever reasonI hate this fucking country sometimesI notice it's oftentimes instead of sometimes these days. At this point we can't even pretend it's just human life abroad we don't care about. How much American life have we sacrificed this last year? For uh the economy I guess? As if the economy were the most important thing and human life exists just to feed into it and not that it's just a fucking system we invented to supposedly make our lives easier.Safe to assume that since many US corporations seem to have superseded institutional power so has the military-industrial complex. And likely long ago. What we face as Americans is figuring out how to rein something like it in.Bro my first thought was no wonder these people hate America.I love America  eye hate AmeriKKKaSomething that really bothered me with this was how someone (maybe the military?) said the ISIS attack 1 day after used the same type and color car which had been on the same street the day the airstrike happened meaning the US then mixed up the vehicles. This sounds like a good excuse but fucking everyone in Afghanistan has a Toyota Corolla. When the Taliban were in charge long ago they decided cars were not allowed but of course the rich need cars so Toyota Corollas were allowed they were seen by the taliban as taxi-cars. This meant a ton of people bought Toyota Corollas and its extremely popular in Afghanistan. \s\sThe cars that were mixed up were 2 white Toyota Corollas. Theyre praying on the fact people dont know how bad of an excuse that is since thats probably the countrys 1# popular car model.Please can we just fucking stop thisThe world's greatest oxymoron:  military intelligence.Hey it was worth a shot I guess. They knew they couldn't bomb the CIA agent who actually planned the airport attack so they just bombed a rando and crossed their fingers that no one would check. Almost always worked in the past. And either way it got them through a news cycle.It’s known too that us troops had sprayed into random people they thought may be taliban but turns out it was just random citizens. It doesn’t get any media coverage in the US because ofc it won’t.So many innocent people have been Murdered with US drones its Ridiculous[deleted]The particular missile has 6 knives that chop people up they don't blow them up: [Hellfire](https://imgur.com/0VHZfaQ.jpg)MuricaOur country is being run by idiots.US strategic command are a bunch of fuckin' war criminals.US is just amping up the rate at which Afgans join the taliban and other extremists groups. You see we are not fighting a stupid war at the moment and that is a big problem. There needs to be a reason to go back and or hit another joint up for a change.America has it coming. If in the future another incident like 9/11 happens they better not make a pikachu faceshouldn\`t the operator be charged with war crimes since the target was not a terrorist and this was murder ?worst part is that no one in the US military is going be responsible for the act. Who's to say that one's life is more important than the others...The issue is that in the US Military accountability only extends to the enlisted class. I was only in for 4 years but I never once saw an officer be held accountable for anything they did wrong. We had a girl in my command die because Medical ignored an infection she had until it literally turned into sepsis. Not a single officer in Medical was held accountable. It was swept under the rug. Now the CO we had at the time is an Admiral the XO we had at the time is now the CO of a very prestigious command the Medical officers went on to do bigger and better things or retire with full benefits. \s\sYou are absolutely correct. Whoever is responsible for this will face no penalty or punishment.If American's weren't so sanctimonious about asking military personnel how many people they killed in war then the military might feel more compelled to not go on murder sprees.\s\sMaybe it seems tasteless to ask but the bloody truth is that that is the fundamental function of the military. To kill others in aggressive invasions of others' lands or kill others in defense of your homeland. \s\sBeing more honest as a society about that part of the military might make people question whether they want to take on positions that involve wiping entire families off the planet akin to playing a video game.Why did they lie about it for? Just make them look worstBiden said he was proud of his accomplishments including the withdrawal from Iraq.  This rush drone strike was how he was going to look strong and decisive after not green-lighting the opportunity to take out the the suicide car bomber that killed 13 servicemen and countless locals the day before.  Don’t forget he was against the mission to get Osama Bin laden.Film suggestion: *Good Kill (2014)* Dir. Andrew Niccol (Gattaca The Truman Show Lord of War) Starring Ethan Hawke.

For 20 years we been installing ""Democracy"" over there and the true numbers will probably never come to light of all the life lost on bad Intel. Fucking savage.Just listen to a podcast about this a couple hours back I believe in the podcast they were referring to events that happen around 10 years back well its nice to see the US hasn't changed.I don't know what the big deal is about America killing a family. It's America killing a family. That's it. \s\sIt's not like Taliban shoving women around or looking at a gay man angrily that it should garner so much attention.Team America saves the day once again…This is the real face of the US in the world Americans think that all other countries think of them as a friend but that is just your news channels. The only reason 'terrorism' is a thing is because of actions taken by the US around the world through its policy or by the military.I'm a US American born and raised but fuck or government this shit it's fucked and it's not a first innocent were killedWho cares they'll never achieve shit anywaythis comment is not surprising. Same type of guy to shit his pants if someone made a comment about 911. Anyways your military didn't achieve shit in 20 years except for an excess in ptsd patients. Have fun.Comment on a similar post from u/god_im_bored that i think is worth pasting. \s\s“It is important to keep track of all the lies that the Pentagon said with this one as well as the lies that were spread through social media including Reddit\s\s1.	⁠The military initially claimed that there were no civilian casualties. They backtracked because media started reporting on the civilian deaths and because the family was part of an aid agency\s2.	⁠The military then claimed that the family died due to a secondary explosion by a car bomb that the terrorist was supposedly going to use (note: all of this was a fucking lie)\s3.	⁠Social media including Reddit started to spread the false info that the missile used was a inert missile without explosives and that it was impossible for this missile to cause the damage that happened (this despite no official claim about this for this incident; some people even used a report from a previous strike to use as evidence for this)\s4.	⁠Once it became known that the family was claiming that the US government was lying (through articles from Al Jazeera and the Intercept) people then switched to the argument that this was all necessary in order to prevent terror\s5.	⁠The DOD also maintained the same message as the people in 4. above by claiming that this was a justified strike that helped prevent another attack despite no evidence shown for it\s6.	⁠Against all this the official stance of the US government is still that that they are investigating the details of the incident and that they “regret” the lives lost despite refusing to releasing any further details including the name of the terrorist that they supposedly deterred.\s\sThat didn't happen.\s\sAnd if it did it wasn't that bad.\s\sAnd if it was that's not a big deal.\s\sAnd if it is that's not my fault.\s\sAnd if it was I didn't mean it.\s\sAnd if I did\s\sYou deserved it.”Yes you are in fact the baddies.Welcome and remember to subscribe to r/worldnewsvideo!

Ice is still modern gestapo tho.ACAB[removed]This is why I advocate for at least some protestors to be armed. It's amazing how the gestapo's attitude changes when they see a few (or a lot) of protestors with ARs and AKs.That's basically what happened in the late 60's when MLK learned the same lesson the hard way and it's looking like that's what's gonna have to happen now bare minimum if we're gonna stop them.

It's going to get worse before it gets better. election year is gonna be fuuuucked.\s\sThe people in power currently see the end and there's no line they won't cross.\s\sThe thin veneer of decency has been thrown overboard.People can protest without being agressive and violent and workers can call the police to clear the road so they can work. No need to run over anyone regardless of your political point of view.They were waiting for the police to come and arrest them for blocking a parking lot which is what is supposed to happen.People can refuse to support blatantly oppressive fascist policies like literal actual genocide and not pretend that the goings-on are normal or in any way representative of what the U.S. is supposed to stand for too but I mean here we are.Just saying but I think labeling the post as ""ICE"" trying to run people over is misleading. Like fuck ICE and fuck the guy driving the truck but he worked for a prison that was connected to ICE he's not part of ICE himself. Likely just someone who worked there that just wanted to clock In and do his shit and wasn't really having it still no excuse but it didn't look like he was ready to just straight up run them over like some ""hobo with a shotgun""-esque killing spree.Time to tear ICE apart.What happens here is super bad but this title is clickbait AF.A man drove his vehicle into these people with the intention to hurt them.  They got hurt.  This is a felony.Four people were hit and two were literally hospitalized after being hit by the truck but you're accusing it of being clickbait.

I don't in any shape or fashion support ICE but considering the situation and how ""welcomed"" he was by the protestors I would have driven through them as well.

It shouldn't be long now.They are essentially nihilists at this point no center to their ideology just acquiring power.It could be plural.  ""A hypocrisy of Republicans.""Generalizing at this scale isn't helpful. Changing minds and points of view is central to any revolution. We can keep name-calling but it tends not to be very helpful to our larger cause.Hate to break it to you but it goes both ways. The GOP is a criminal organizationI can wag my finger at you but don't you dare wag back!AH-HAHAHAHAHAHA\s\sHang him with his own rope the dumb fuck.wow!I was just thinking about another politician who avoided perjury by saying ""I don't recall"" over and over. Maybe the GOP should start thinking about holding their own accountable now. It wasn't bad enough for Alabama to have Roy Moore in the Supreme Court and the Luv Guv but now this Sessions mess just piles it on.\s\sGood luck Alabama!A Republican hypocrite? Allahu Akbar  I can't believe it.Was he under oath when he said he didn't speak to a Russian official? If he wasn't he hasn't commited perjury yet.Why do politicians wait until they're ""under oath"" to lie and face the law to take the power The People gave them away? Why doesn't lying mean good reason for terminating them as an employee of the government? \s\s\sWhat message are we sending politicians the world and our children letting politicians get away with lies upon lies?He was under oath.

I honestly don't understand what you're specifically criticizing? That the tactic to point out that Sessions is hypocritical is a weak one? I don't get it.lol r/iamverysmart I have read this three times now and it is meaningless word salad each time.\s\sDid you just throw a bunch of Latin words in a blender in an attempt to sound smart? What they hell were you TRYING to say?I'm just here to watch you get shit on.Well it's a good thing he didn't perjer himself. He's a lawyer ffs. I promise you he knows how to avoid incriminating himself.Back when I was in Nam I noticed irregularities in the financial statements of my NCO club and questioned them officially which resulted in a visit by two guys in civvies who informed that Vietnam was a very dangerous place especially for those pushing their noses into stuff that didn't concern them and that people showed up dead every single day and never a question was asked.\s\sCIA was skimming the clubs to finance their drug trade which financed their darker ops.\s\sSo yeah but not just a terrorist outfit but also a criminal one.They killed jfk.Maybe this is news for Americans but for the rest of the world this is obvious.I'm an Arizonan. I'll never vote Republican but I will vote for any Democratic primary challenger to run against her.Same. She really fucked herself over and nothing she does will change my mind about her nowNeoliberal shillA vile one at that. She was hanging out with fucking Black bloc back in 2003 so she's completely sold out from her younger self.Or DINO$15 minimum isnt even a fair wage. Like fucks sake how the hell is this still an issue? Fucking corporate shill someone better run against her and winI’m college educated.  I’m a drafting engineer.  5 years ago they hired me at $15.  I absolutely want the min to be raised to $15.  But I’m like wtf a college education will earn me as much as a fast food employee?

And since they're rich other rich people give them more money.\s\sWe need to go to publically-financed elections and no candidate is allowed outside resources. Plus no outside group should be able to run political ads. It's time to get money out of politics so politicians have to represent and answer to the people and not the corporations.Good. Fuck her ass kissing McConnell curtesy thumbs down no to raising minimum wage. Fake woke bitch.Good she's a ignorant racist fascist and has to be primaried and have all DNC support dropped.Let's be real the DNC likely supports this action. I hope she's primaried the DNC dumps millions into keeping her in her seat and she loses anyway.Cmon man I don’t particularly like her or her politics  but I don’t think she’s a Republican.\s\sEdit: fellow liberals you’re downvoting someone on your side. I’m not sorry for my opinion but sheesh guys . . . I thought we were better than this.Should be 27 anywaysCouldn't have happened to more deserving person.She obviously calculated who would support her if she voted 'no.'   It's the most cynical gambit in the world but extremely strategic. \s\sShe wanted people to see that was her position. She'll stick her neck out for capitalism. \s\sWhat she's betting on is that neoliberal centrists will retain a dominant position in the party.  After Biden won it looked like that would be the case. Being brave enough to stick up for the donor class will put you in their camp and they know you are 100% reliable. \s\sSince the GOP is no longer a respectable party corporate interests that care about public opinion will be forced to support the Dems. Of course they will flock to Dems like her--ones who are eager to protect their financial position.\s\sIt would probably be good for all concerned if she loses but the Senator who would take her place will be a lunatic because AZ GOP has gone full conspiracy addled. \s\sThat's another thing she knows she has going for her.\s\sThe position she has staked out rarely loses. She's clearly in it for Kyrsten Sinema and nobody and nothing else.> She's clearly in it for Kyrsten Sinema and nobody and nothing else.\s\sThat sounds so Republican.She only won because she ran against mcsaLLyShe really let us down didn’t she?Just as expected!!!Good.

(YES!)I still don’t understand why we’re fighting for minimum wage to go up instead of the cost of living to go down...I honestly don't know the economics of it but my guess is that it's easier to get the government to mandate a higher minimum wage than it is to regulate the cost of things like housing healthcare education groceries utilities etc.What was her favorability before opposing the $15 minimum wage?Pass pass puffI can understand and respect his reasons for doing this.\s\sBut just for lulz I'm gonna go full Q and suggest that the stack of firewood behind him is a coded message to burn it all down.no ... gave him 1600 this cycle alone... they have a gun to head... don't need to hear a hostage speak\s\s Foucus on congress and senate progressive wins“ Dear America  my own party sabotaged my candidacy AGAIN and now I’m being forced to tell you to vote for Biden “\s\s\s- Bernieyea...its hard listening to anything he says now. its like a rape victim making excuses for his abusersIs Josh Hawley running for president in 2024?

Because otherwise there is no reason to be having such garbage takes.There’s nothing that ironic about two racists competing for the same position.a soggy piece of bread would make a better president than Trump. So the argument “at least he’s better than Trump” holds very little water. Maybe even less than said soggy piece of bread. You guys are having a *primary* right now so you can pick a good candidate not one who is only the teeniest tiniest bit better than Trump in demeanour and probably equally horrible for America on a number of policy issues.

0,PoliticalVideo,BernieSanders,15,"But Warren says he doesn’t.... 🙄Rant - As much as Warren bowing out early would help us  I don't see it happening.  Rather than piling on her i think this should more so be a lesson as to what the democratic party Biden aligned corporate media is capable of. Creating a stir right before the debate ahead of the first primary based on heresay. So the debate is on semantics rather than real issues or authentic attacks on Biden that a simple Obama ref can't recuse him from.  The Warren/Sanders squabble only fuels the CNNs Voxs whatever that corporate democratic propaganda meme machine on FB that my friends share all the time.  Bernie/Warren need to learn their lesson and get on the same page next time.👏👏👏👏 YESRemember Warren was still a Republican at this time.🔥🤝 FRIENDS AMERICANS AND [SUPPORTERS ABROAD (who can volunteer but not donate or buy merch)](https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/#Volunteer) 🤝🔥\s\sIf you seriously support Bernie *do not let this campaign pass without volunteering*. **It's the only way we win** and it's as easy & quick as you choose.\s\s* [General signup](https://act.berniesanders.com/signup/volunteer-bernie-sanders/) \- start here\s* [Local events map](https://map.berniesanders.com) \- canvasses phonebank & watch parties rallies\s* [BERN web](https://app.berniesanders.com) / [google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berniesanders&hl=en_US) / [apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bern-official-bernie-2020-app/id1474294851) app - canvassing & volunteer tool\s* [BerniePB](https://www.berniepb.com) \- phonebank leaderboards teams realtime map\s* [FeelTheBern.org](https://www.feelthebern.org) needs Spanish translation help!\s* [Learn how to register and vote](https://voteforbernie.org/) for Bernie\s* [Donate](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sanders-for-president?refcode=thermometer) - this campaign is running *entirely* on small donations.

Republicans really haven't changed in decades.Just another example of why Trump is such a black hole of morality. War criminals corrupt politicians traitors! let's pardon them!Okay I burst out laughing when the ticker at the bottom revealed this was somehow a discussion on the clean water act.goddamn the whole system is broken if this is about the clean water actThis the shit Alex Jones was inspired by when he talked about the water supply turning frogs gay?He's infamous for stating some Democrats should be lined up and shot same exact thing he said about Vietnam war protesters.\s\sSounds like to me he can't handle people disagreeing with him to put it lightly.\s\sAlso he was against getting a finger in his ass during prostate exams because he believed it was ""unnatural"".""I felt very uncomfortable because I enjoyed it and I accidentally came""Anyone that publicly objects to a prostate exam out of some weird sense of hetero-masculinity has in my mind 100% has put a finger up their ass before. I have had a prostate exam in the ER and let me tell you there is nothing sexual about it and I did not feel in any way less secure about my sexuality after. It was an important step in ascertaining if I was bleeding internally which I thought was a greater need than any perspective of masculinity. As it turns out I was bleeding internally but am absolutely fine now.Imagine the fear the terror people felt back in the old days of knights and castles when people like him were in charge.. Probably similar to what's here now.He sounds like seasonal-rot Peter Griffin.You cannot tell me this dude scuba divesIf he can't scuba then what's all this been about?My favorite part was him yelling 'Socialist'.\s\sNothing has changed with these people.And then later calling them liberals. Which one is it lolThe major change is a shift from Ronald Reagan & Jesus towards Trump but otherwise agree lolDon't threaten me with a good time *gentleman*...( ͡♥ ͜ʖ ͡♥)America's history is full of that. I thought it was just a modern-day thing but after reading *The People's History* I came to understand that a huge reason why America lacks in some many social areas is because from the get-go the wealthy and powerful have used the socialist/socialism as a fear-mongering device to slow down progress in those areas. It was a very depressing read.I like gay people but still hate socialism.""Do we have to call the gentleman a 'gentleman' if he is not one?""\s\sRofl.The little smirk she gave after saying that made it even more amazing lol.Man.\sWe truly don't deserve Bernie.\s\sForever saddened knowing our country could have had him as a leader and pushed him aside and ridiculed him instead.I didn't even agree with all of his policies but God damn did he have my vote.Yeah. Good on President Joe for taking the blame of the upcoming Covid deaths and the fall of Afghanistan. The media would have loved to pin this on old evil socialist Bernie.You should read about William Wilberforce. It's a humanity classic: a great dude comes along we piss on him then when he's dead we make a statue.Probably one of the least effective legislators in history given his long tenure and nothing to show for it.It's crazy that he thought that was ever acceptable.\s\sIf you look into the guy's background he accepted over $2.4 million in bribes & was pardoned by Trump. Real lovely fellaGay servicepersonell were banned and if outed the were imprisoned and dishonorably discharged. This went on until 2010 in USA. I wonder how many lives were destroyed.>  he accepted over $2.4 million in bribes\s\sNot even that much money. What was he gonna do with just $2.4m?  The guy was not smart.  He was powerful.These people really just harp on that ""socialist"" thing without a need for evidence. Even back then.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Cunningham\s\sHe took $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors. You'll never guess which president pardoned him.It was Trump I read about it earlier in this threadAmerica doesn't deserve Bernie Sanders.And yet Hillary Clinton was the ""progressive nominee"" ahead of Bernie Sanders who has only served the interests of the people since his start in public office.\s\sAbsolute sham/e.It really is a shame. I honestly think electing Bernie was our last chance and we missed it. He would have been an uncompromisingly strong leader as always. Now the American government is so crippled by ignorance and greed that we're vulnerable.i feel like the 90s was the bursting point of homophobia before it slowly started to be accepted. to stand up against it during that time is a big deal.I don't think we'll elect a very old person again after what we are seeing with Biden.> Bernie Sanders who has only served the interests of the people\s\sIn 1983 while mayor of Burlington Sanders created a brand new salaried government position for his girlfriend.\s\sIn 1991 Sanders opposed the Brady Bill which required federal background checks for purchasing firearms.\s\sIn 1996 he voted against a bill that would have prohibited police from purchasing tanks and armored carriers.\s\sIn 2001 he voted in favor of the invasion of Afghanistan.\s\sBetween 2002 and 2004 Sanders funneled $155000 of campaign donations to his wife and daughter.\s\sA politician is a politician is a politician. Sanders just has a good marketing team.imagine how the world would look if Bernie got electedCould have had him... twice! We really don't deserve Bernie at all.The powers that be won’t let someone who wants to take from the rich and give to the poor be president.

And when I say white supremacist I mean proud member of the KKK. Look him up the dudes story is absolutely wild.Do you know when this happened?Bernie was already an old man 20 years agoconservatives really have no problem with being on the wrong side of historythe logic is that if they win they can simply rewrite anything so winning is their only goal.They get paid millions in corporate bribes for it.I can't wait for these old stone age racist to die off..Homo.

But in reality it was over 25 years ago. I’d forgotten about this exchange almost completely. I was around 12 years old during this time. My only way of knowing this ever happened was from my brother who was very much into politics around this time and years after. He constantly watched C-Span. He was a teenager at that time too 4 years older than me. \sI remember the mid to late nineties being a very progressive time in many many ways and this shitshow Mr. Cunningham created on the House floored was largely rebuked at the time and openly mocked. I don’t know maybe it was in our neck of the woods in the country at least. Either way it’s really depressing to know that this mans inflammatory language has now come back from underneath the depths.

These dumb fucks are destroying our planet.  They know. They don’t care.This is obviously anecdotal but I'm only in my late 20's and I've noticed that winters have gotten a lot milder compared to when I was a kid. It used to be that the whole time from december-march you'd have a lot of ice overnight and in the trees. Last winter the trees near my house didn't even lose all their foliage.The thing I truly do not understand though is where he comes to this conclusion. So if you believe science does not have the answers where do you get your answers from. Like where did he deduce that it will be cooler sometime again.And he’ll claim he’s much much smarter than scienceThat's exactly what he's getting at. He's so stupid he's thinking short term as in this year it will get colder.*trumpers applaudI mean.. he isn't wrong. Just that cooler may be 10*F could also mean 0*F hell... probably means -20*F. \s\sStill cooler than right now. Which is warmer.Wait so the current heat is due to climate change but the cold weather in a few months isn't?\s\sI agree with climate change and all but that argument doesn't make any sense...Hang on there as it turns to night it will get cooler and he'll claim that as a win before fall.  You know science does not know how it becomes night.  Might be the Earth rotating we just can't be sure.It snowed See told you idiots! Vote trump for cooler climates in january!https://ifglobalwarmingisrealwhyisitcold.tumblr.com/This smoke has dropped temps by ten or twenty degrees here. The plants think it's winter they're not even drinking water.Some guy probablyYea this needed an intimidate follow up question of ""do you mean because winter is coming or in the next couple decades temps will come down rather then continuing up as currently projected?""In February in Alaska: \sIt's snowing here. Global warming is a hoax!Sounds about rightDidn't he claim that exact thing last year when the states had some really cold (might've been record setting? Or maybe that was another severe event...) weather.\s\sPretty certain it was shot down by a lot of people. Something along the lines of climate change causing more extreme weather events rather then just hotter temperatures.Haha “didn’t I tell ya’ll it would get cooler’. How This donkey is running a country surprises me everyday.And then the apocalyptic blizzards will begin...Actually Sacramento CA area remains hot usually until late October these days. Don't think we'll see a slow down for a bit unless there's a random storm that comes across.He just doesn't want us to panic.\s\s/sGlobal warming? But it's still cold at the North Pole and in my refrigerator?? Checkmate dipfucktards!*brings snowball into the senate*Science doesn't know how to drop in temperature but it'll happen ""you'll see""What on earth is this kinda format?\sIt feels like I am watching a TV show and Trump is the host cracking unfunny jokes for canned laughter. He is trying so hard to fullfill the role of the entertainer that he is completely missing the horrible situation that is unfolding right now.He IS the horrible situation unfolding right now.You'll get that when you have a narcissistic sociopath who's at the helm of the largest military in the world.\sTrump would be fine with a civil war if it meant he stayed in power.This is how he does round tables. He rambles on for 15 minutes up front then goes around and has everyone talk for like five minutes. Many will just kiss his ass but a few will actually say something of substance. And then as seen in the video he’ll make remarks like some grandad at the dinner table asking the grandkids to say how old they are. He does these all the times and nothing is said other than gloating about trump.Befitting of a reality star.One unlikely celebrity!\s\sA panel of judges!\s\sAnd 300 million unknowing participants!\s\sTune in this week for a new episode of The President!When your country has an attention span that is only measurable in nano seconds.Im starting to think that asteroid they mentioned a few times over the last few months might actually be bigger and on a direct path with Earth. \s\sTrump lied about hurricanes pandemics global warming and countless other things. Its not impossible that he doesnt give a shit anymore because he knows whats about to happen.He acts like everything is a roast.The guy you heard laughing laughed at him because it's so stupid thothat's literally exactly what he said about covid back in february“when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”""It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle it will disappear.”I had a thought the other day if theres infinity realities and everything happens then Trump was right in a bunch and Covid did just go away. Now 200k+ people didnt die there but Trump was right about a huge science related subject and I can only imagine that would make that reality far worse in the long run compared to ours.""BuT hE tElLs It LiKe It Is!""can you believe people actually support this fucking moron? ""science wrong me right!""Yes I can. My neighbors both went full Trump 2-3 years ago. All of a sudden they both bought a bunch of guns the husband bought a jacked up F350 (big pp edition) they set up flags all around their property... they just went bonkers. They weren't always crazy-- they used to just be indifferent about Obama but still admitted Obamacare saved their asses when they weren't doing too well. \s\sFunniest part is the husband won $100k off a lottery ticket and it's like he thinks Trump gave him that money. My biggest complaint is that neither the husband or wife have a clue about gun safety. She shot a hole in their garage while apparently taking a FB profile picture and the police didn't even fucking do anything meanwhile there's little kids who bike up and down the road right in front of their house. I guess those ""Blue Lives Matters"" stickers really do pay off...[deleted]The greenhouse gas effect is literally one of the easiest science experiments to do I did it in the 5th grade!Maybe he knows the world is in a cataclysmic climate crisis but he has to lie so ~~the rich get richer~~ we don’t panicYou see what he's actually alluding to here is the impending nuclear winter that he's fully aware of /sI was browsing a /r/trump the other day and they bashed Joe because he's old and reading off a teleprompter.

A few comments down someone said that Trump is one of the sharpest minds on the planets even scientists were shocked about how much he knows about science. \s\sI understand that you're racist and support the racist guy who wouldn't but that is just a cult who glorify some turd for no reason at all.It FEELS good.  Admitting that we (the US) are primarily responsible for the co2 in the atmosphere is difficult and people don’t like to admit responsibility.  Denying the issue exists allows people to continue on with their lives and ignore the problem.But Brawndo got what plants craveRight wing media has done a pretty bang up job of convincing people that scientists are the enemy. In fact they basically vilified the entire idea of intellectualism. They paint them as the ones trying to trick them for greed. As opposed to the politicians they idolize. All I can say is both my parents are scientists and I'm still waiting for them to making millions off global warming.Every day we sink deeper into the Onion article that is our reality.That seems to be the strategy: Beat em to the punch!I used to love reading Onion articles but this is so hard to watch.What in the ever loving fuck?  How in the hell is this man POTUS?  It just doesn't make sense.""Oh we're WELL past that.""This is what happens when it’s a bad thing to score 50th percentile on standardized tests. America’s educational infrastructure is weak and is no more than a glorified babysitting service with a few rare and valuable exceptions mixed in.[deleted]Please vote this dumb motherfucker out of officedespite everything this dumb motherfucker has a very good chance of winning. it's insane.Remember that we never even voted this dumb motherfucker into office.\s\sThe system is broken.I literally have no idea what I'd do of he wins againOk. I mean you didn't have to tell me but I will be doing just that. I hope to say buhbye to this lunatic asshole soon.The way Trump dismissed his well articulated point because his ego is so fragile.  His only character is this passive aggressive doubting thomas with condescending crappy side-cracks.  Obvious unwillingness to want an intelligent conversation about anything ever.\s\sThe man cannot detach from himself and it's now getting silly. \s\sThis man can't be told anything by anybody about anything unless it's on his terms.  I don't know why people bother engaging with him like this.  Do they really expect him to listen and process what they're saying like a normal person would?\s\sI feel sorry for that guy who really tried.  Fueled by a passion to make the planet a better place with the best tool we have.  There isn't an alternative to science.  It's all we have and it's pretty damn good.  He is following the science to make the best decisions possible but Donald Trump just shit all over it because of a fragile ego.\s\sThey need to find a format where he can't be a stubborn prick like this and ruin good people's attempts to make life better for people and save the planet.\s\sThis guy is riddled with personality disorders to the point where his own wife can barely look at him and his daughter has on many occasions implied that pushing boundaries and general creepyness is just daddy being daddy. \s\sIf I saw this video 10 years ago I would have thought it was a comedy skit about an alternative future where Donald Trump became president and was being hilariously close minded when the world was on fire.\s\sAdd a laughter track and a comedy intro music and Trump's dismissive comment would seem a perfect punchline.  But like people are saying.  This is not a joke.  It's the Onion becoming reality and it's incredibly sad for the world.\s\sGood luck USA.  I hope this time next year the world is looking brighter and this man is gone from power.Even if he's gone we'll still have 60 million people who see a guy like that and say ""he should lead this country"" and they'll continue to elect people like that.I feel like if I was one of those experts up there I would have just got up and left after he said that and maybe said ""this is a waste of my fucking time."" like he's literally laughing and dismissing their advice why should they waste their time trying to convince an idiot of something he will never ever ever be convinced of.\s\si'd get fired but i'm sure i could get a job from a million other places that would love how I ""stood up"" to trump. sure they could replace him with a trump supporter but who cares if he's not gonna listen to you then who knows.\s\sedit: or better I'd ask trump ""what are you basing that on?"" and when he comes back with his normal BS i would say ""so you're just basing it off of what you would like to happen and not basing it on any evidence at all"" and THEN i'd walk the fuck out of there.\s\sOr maybe even like ""donald you're a threat to the entire world and it's a waste of my time talking to someone like you""\s\swhy the fuck to experts just laugh when trump calls them liars? call trump the fuck out! at the very least don't fucking laugh. jesus fucking christ. how do they just laugh and move on! that's insane! i'd get up and call trump a clown. because he is one. that is actually being generous.\s\sexperts laughing at trump calling them liars is how we get another holocaust. i'm not being hyperbolic at all. if the top experts get derided by the ""president"" then we are lost. and it has happened. and so we are lost. fuck trump. he's at least as bad as hitler. he's even worse than hitler since he doesn't even care. my god man. how insecure can one man be.\s\sedit: and to the donald supporters i'm not saying trump is as worse than hitler at hitler's height i'm saying trump is worse than hitler on his climb to power. hitler didn't have to deal with climate change. i bet even hilter would have acknowledged climate change at this point. so on that point the gop is worse than hitler. because hitler would've been smart enough to acknowledge the obvious threat of man made climate change.💯This is a fucking horror show. How did this happen?Because the average American has the IQ of a lima bean and therefore voted this bufoon into office.Social media and the destruction of the middle classImagine being the guy trying to plead with the president to find a way to stop the world from burning and the president is like ""science isn't real. its gonna get cooler.""\s\sI'm pre-pissed that this clown is going to get re-elected. If you don't think he is you haven't been paying much attention to 2020 thus far.Ir does look like the election will be a nail biterOnce the temp drops as we get deeper into Fall ""See I told you so.""I’ve been actively avoiding the news for a couple months but even I know he will likely get elected. The boomers want their champion.Obviously anything can happen but basically every metric we have has Biden winning by a large margin. I'm not saying Trump definitely won't get reelected but paying attention to what's happening isn't a better indication than everything else. For example even the stock markets indicate that Biden will win in that companies favoured by democratic policies have had a significantly larger increase in value than those which would be benefited by republican policies. That and also all betting platforms have significantly higher odds on Biden winning. Those are two groups who could not give a fuck about morality ethics ideology etc all they care about is making decisions which will get them money and they're putting their money on Biden. Of course it isn't election time yet Trump could start a war he could implement martial law Biden could dieetc who knows but the statistics as they currently are show Biden winning.Yeah and attitudes like this will help make it happen. If you've been paying attention you know that Biden is ahead but Trump has a significant chance of winning still.He won’t get re-elected but he may fuck the system up to the point where he can claim victory in the chaos.4 more years of this shit. \s\sYEARS.  FOUR YEARS.  UnrealDonald Trump's presidency is a shining example of Boomer entitlement mixing with a participation trophy mentality towards the presidency: Rather than tell people they can be president someday of they rise to the needs of the role Trump is showing them the bar will be lowered to accommodate them and the temper tantrums they throw until they get their way.\s\s**Edit:** And if anyone in that room had a spine they'd call Trump out as the idiot he is.I hope Trump is the shit stain their generation skids out on.Calling him out is counterintuitive toward their goals. They have to work with him and he laughs in their faces as people die and entire states burn. His cult loves it.\s\sIt's the worst part of this whole fucking mess.\s\sThey *need* him and he *loves* it.Simulation confirmedMy Man!Why do we have a man with an IQ of an 8th grader leading our country?I'm really not tooting my own horn but I was much smarter than Trump in 8th grade. Maybe just as awkward but definitely smarter and so were you.A lot of your 7th grade people voted for him.Caution:  EXPLODING 💣 TREES 🌲ahhh... winter in Bastogne.😟\s\soh.\s\sMy.\s\sGosh.Reddit has a rule against condoning violence so I can't express myself whatsoever on this issue.\s\sSo therefor I too will say Oh Gorsh Darn.What an ignorant loser.What a stupid asshole.How do you even defend this? I have no respect for anyone still supporting this fucking clown.They defend it by also being anti-science because they all mimic whatever he believes.It's no surprise that a large portion of his voter base are religious nutcases who deny science and think ""God"" has a plan for us all.Wait. The fucking presdient just basically said science isn't real? Wtf?Nuclear winter incoming.[Trump](https://i.imgur.com/zAVXu6d.jpg) while listening to the fake science mathsThey'll be dead & gone before they're affected.Yeah it will get cooler. Once we enter a new ice age due to lack of enviromental policies.Cant wait to ski across Death Valley\s\s/sthis orange idiot just continues to spit out complete bullshit and his idiot followers eat it all up and ask for more.Fuck this absolute moron and all of the morons that voted for him.That orange-haired POS is an absolute disgrace to this country and i'm sorry I know the truth hurts some people but so are all his supporters at this point. FUCK ALL YOU at this point. \s\sI'm sorry but when you have a political party that ignores universal held truths and facts you are no longer a party but a CULT. FUCK TRUMP. and FUCK his stupid low-life inbred supporters. You people have done nothing but hurt this country and our standing with the world.As a Canadian who lives abroad all I can say regarding that last statement is: And how!At this point Trump  look like the villain of a kids movie in wich two brothers their skater female friend and their talking dog want to stop a rich evil guy from building a mall right where the last  bee livesOr a straight up captian planet villanGod Damn this guy is the Cringe mascot he is so clueless and wrong on every point. I live in California which has turned into Tatooine and he has NO CLUE of the suffering and damage the 90% FEDERAL managed forests going up have done to the air quality and destruction to life and property. The sooner he is gone the better I am no Biden fan but a potted plant would be better.I feel super sorry for you because we had the same thing last summer with the worst fires on record.\s\sIt's happening in western united states now to and there's still no proper action it's like what will it take for people to wake up.they're trying so hard to make sure he knows they're trying to science it up.\s\s&#x200B;\s\shis dumbass response: ""[it'll get cooler](https://youtu.be/HP8sofAN4xc)""[deleted]The dumbest man on earth other than the morons that vote for himTrump: ""I don't think science knows""\s\sWe are fucked if he gets re-elected\s\sEdit: TypoHe’s such an incredible piece of shit.This isn't cringe. This is very VERY bad. This is American leadership. MILLIONS of Americans believe climate change to be the single most important political issue of our time and our president won't even take a second to even consider discussing it. He laughs in the face of our concerns. This is bad.This guy is president of USA.\s\sWtf conservativesholy fuck he is a moronI hate that man its almost a fight or flight reaction every time  I hear him speak. He is dangerous.Damn your President sure is stupid as hell! It's like trying to blow Ice cream to warm it  up.We will all died at the hands of a orange creamsicleJesus it's like watching a little kid sitting there while the teacher is talking and not listening to a word they are saying.Whenever he's challenged it's all *zings* and *gotcha*.  He's still slinging playground insults.  I'm surprised he didn't call science a dookey head!Can't wait till this clown gets covid and dies of irony.What a fucking dick.It's only about him and he knows he doesn't have much time left on this planet so he'll ultimately never have to deal with it. \s\sIf he cared about his family or his youngest son's future he'd fucking do something about it.God damn he’s so fucking arrogantly stupidThis man is in charge of a country. Brutal.We’re so fucked.When winter comes around he’ll say “look I told you it would start getting cooler.” 😩I have heard from the highest authority in the American land that people are saying all sorts of things and if you want to justify anything you can just say ""they say"" and that's plenty good enough for most people.\s\sIt's stressful.Inb4 trump fans “iT wAs TaKeN oUt Of CoNtExT”At this point I almost think Trump is wondering what he has to say to get people to get rid of him as President.In other news trump has never seen a campfire in winter.I have no idea how my dad thinks this guy is a competent presidentWe so fucked if he gets back in. Jesus Christ.I literally cringed I felt the shameYa but sleepy Biden though /sIf this guy gets elected twice I'm either gonna move to Japan or blow my fucking brains outYeah remember how we can't go to a shitload of countries?Imagine if you had a serious leg injury and you were only allowed to pick a new doctor once every 4 years. The first one tells you that you can be healthy again but rehab is gonna be hard work and painful. You stick with it and show improvement but during the process another doc starts telling you all the shit you’re doing is unnecessary and he can do a better job. You decide to hire that guy after your contract is up and he says “just take oxy bro. You won’t feel the pain anymore.” You start feeling great for a little while but the drugs wear you down eventually and you’re in worse shape than before but when the contract is about to expire you think about who did you better: the guy that put you through a bunch of pain or the guy that fixed the pain. Doesn’t matter that your organs are failing doesn’t matter that you don’t feel so good overall anymore because you remember how good it felt with that first pill to not have any pain and you want to chase that dragon. \s\sThis is the only analogy I can come up with for someone that still supports trump at this point.Imagine living in a country where an enormous fucking moron calls the shots. LolYour president is an ignorant idiot. And the whole of the USA looks like a bunch of assholes for it.Please invade we need an adult :(#TEMPERATURE IS NOT CLIMATE.Try explaining that to MAGAts.  You might as well try explaining it to a brick wall.The fact that people watch this guy say this fucking bullshit and like him for it makes me want to kill myselfJesus Christ man just shut the hell up about serious shit. Lett the scientists handle that.hes  a dummy his supporters are dummies and humanity is doomed.. seems sooner rathter than later and we have the dumb ""elites"" to blame for it.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sIt will be us peasants who tear you apart before we all die you dumb fuck elites.Calm down Trump has said he's going to lower the temperature. everything's ok.  Go buy the new Playstation or Xbox.[removed][removed]Really bad time to even put a joke out nglTide goes in tide goes out. You can’t explain that.\s\sThey really don’t like science do they?also he's been a very good boy and didn't do a poopy in his pantsour president is the definition of stupid.The cringe moments will be when your grandkids ask why you supported Trump when something could have been done to make the planet safer for them. Those will be some fascinating Thanksgiving family dinners.I hate him so much.What an absolute fucking smooth brain window licker he isWINTER IS COMING!  Trump you are a fucking idiot and I wish you would be the one who would die a horrible death in every episode of GoT.I’m pretty moderate in general but I can’t stand anyone who denies climate change. The science is to the point that it’s fucking overwhelmingly obvious what is happening.That’s literally one of the parts of climate change. The summers and winters are both going to get more extreme. This guy would know that if his brain had been little more than a dessicated squirrel carcass that ran on a wheel which has now fallen off the hinge and rusted away.So tired of people pussyfooting around with this human fungusAnd ppl still won’t care & will vote for this conman... against their own interests.This halfwit is predicting winter?  Huh... Who would have known?\s\sAlso if you vote for or support this fuckwit you need to stop eating lead paint chips.  It's too late for you but hopefully your offspring won't have so much brain damage.Imagine being a scientist...spending decades covering your field only to be told by a failed businessman turned reality star that science doesn’t know anythingYou ever talk to someone who isn't listening to what your saying and is only waiting for you to stop talking so they can speak? They're focused entirely on thinking of the next words to come out of their mouth so they don't hear you. It's interesting to see this play out in video.How can you look at such arrogance and see leadership. It's depressing wondering how his base justifies everything he does.He's just doing what he always does spew shit to buy timeHmmm what does this remind me of?\s\sOh!\s\s""The infected... you just watch... today its 13 in a week it will be like gone done zero. Nobody knows better than me.He is so dangerously ignorant. His response to most things is sticking his fingers in his ears and shouting so he won't hear the bad man say mean things.The temperature here in Portland was supposed to be 95 last week but was dramatically lower. Thanks Trump! (The sun was blocked out by all of the smoke because the fucking world is on fire).So why is the climate crisis even allowed to be a political opinion? Are these people so obsessed with money that they'd rather spread lies and see the planet die than lose a few hundred billion to fix the problem?What i hate most of all is the smugness as he says it... I've had *dumbass* co-workers and ex-friends do the same after trying to explain science to these people when discussing their beliefs (like flat earth the Rothschild's and 5G). Always ""oh sure trust *science* 😏"". God this country is worse every day.\s\sIf Trump wins again I'm moving to the other side of the world. I think that's what these people want. In 10 years I'll be telling my kids stories about how I used to live in this backwards country.Truly an all-time moron. Stain on history.Lol you have to be so weak and stupid to still support donald trump.And they let him laugh it off as a joke. Their response should have been 'This is not a laughing matter.' Push his buttons until he explodes a word salad bomb on tape. Still wouldn't matter to his mouth breathers I guess.Funny thing is you can look at the science on this 15 to 20 years ago and see exactly what was predicted happening right now. You know it will be nice after he is out of office and then people can stop pretending to kiss his ass and really call out his lunacy.Very few politicians have the will to enact any serious climate policy because the rich will lose money and said politicians lose their sponsorships. The longer we wait the worse the future will be for our successors. History will remember us for standing by and letting their future turn to dust so we can enjoy our comforts a little longer. Just like the boomers we will leave our children and grandchildren a lower standard of living but hey we strongly condemned governments and corporations online right!I'm not having kids its too late to save humanity. I just hope the animals survive.Vote Blue. I'm no fan of the DNC but Democrats are the only chance we have to address this in any way.\s\sThe green new deal was put forward as a house resolution by Democrats last year and the Republicans in the Senate brought it to a vote with no discussion or expert testimony essentially guaranteeing that it would get shut down considering they're largely in lock step and have enough senators to do so. Any action is guaranteed to be blocked by Republicans if they continue to have a majority in either the House or the Senate. \s\sBiden has net-zero emissions by 2050 in his platform and has pledged to stop subsidizing fossil fuels - you can argue over whether or not that's enough but it's the most action we've seen proposed from a candidate since Gore. It's certainly far better than Trump who pulled us out of the Paris Accord regularly denies climate change appointed a climate change denying former Coal Lobbyist as head of the EPA. I'm not saying that the Democrats will be the perfect candidates and take the drastic action that may well be necessary but they will do WAY more than the republicans.I can't even begin to understand why you're getting downvotes. This is the most honest and profound comment on this thread.One must keep complete control to not get up and smack that moronic orange asshole.Just drop a nuke on the fire the boat wave should be enough wind to put it out right?Trump is smarter than science itself now apparently.I hate this stupid fucking moron. He is evil on purpose and willfully stupid.Checking in from Canada. Can confirm it is cold. Completely unrelated; Autumn is just around the corner![removed]Its so fucking sad that this is what people voted for. I really wish I understood whyIt should be right around when his investigators get back from Hawaii with Obama's real birth certificate.How does anyone still support this idiot?! The only reasonable reason is they are so fearful and hateful of ""others"" they will support this clown despite them being far worse off.Fucking humiliatingremember when he said covid would just go away?It seems most climate change deniers just confuse weather patterns with climate change. Talk about ignorance. \s\sSide note - This isn’t cringe. Just idiotic like every other trump vid posted on this sub.What an Ass hatWas Trump referring to winter??? LolFMLUgh I'm so fucking sick of this piece of fucking shit!!!!Use this in ads please. Why don’t more politicians play back their opponents’ words?“It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle it will disappear.” -trump\s\sFuck his ignoranceIt’ll disappear cause he’ll be dead and won’t be around to noticeThat made my stomach hurtMust be down playing this too. Wouldnt want people to panic...So science doesn't know but 45 does? How are people this confused about reality.just know the same people who are telling athletes to ""stay away from politics"" had no problem with a reality show star running for president.What a dip shitWhat a fucking idiot.There it is. There you go. Lost my vote. Biden still makes me wanna 😩 😫>""I don't think science knows actually"" \s\s\s oh but you do?This is abominable. Absolutely ridiculous behavior. This is horrid.Someone should send him to the warm place he belongs already.I’m convinced the right wing play here is to actively USE the chaos that global warming will cause.  The leadership can’t be so ignorant they can’t understand the greenhouse effect.\s\sOnce the chaos really starts to accelerate people with money and resources can grab greater amounts of power and assets.  They can also use the chaos to drive policies they want; right wing politics thrives on creating long term impossible situations (e.g. Israel/Palestine) and then saying “we HAVE to do XYZ terrible thing there’s no other choice”.At what point does a governor just tell him he's a fucking idiot?He's a mentally stunted barfly facebook grandpa.  Fucking shit.Jfc“I knew the virus was bad but didn’t want to scare people.... also it will cool down” sure budYa know Im am atheist but even I would be good with some revelations level apocalypse right now. The real apocalypse is so slow amd depressing.What's it to him his gana die in 20 or 30 years and we are gana be left with this fked up earthAm I the only the person that laughed uncontrollably when he rebutted that mans heartfelt speech with “it’ll start getting cooler” in a monotone voice*December arrives*\s\sSee it got colder!Fucking. Evil. Godless. Fucking. Worthless. Meat-bag.Y’all I’m out of insults and I’m tired.You can have him Russia. I'll buy his plane ticket for him.It s going to turn to winter in a couple months and his supporters are gonna say “Look he was right!!!”stop laughing when he says crazy shit. Let it sit.  Let it resonate how fucking stupid it is.  Stop trying to lighten it to make it comical.  His shit is stupidSo when is he going to die?It’s pretty damn obvious what’s going on here. And that’s the worst part. All these big corporations are brainwashing people into  thinking we don’t need to save the planet by convincing people that man made climate change isn’t real.  \s\sSo let’s assume that climate change isn’t man made. Guess what everyone???....We still have a finite amount of resources on earth. That’s a truth that no one can deny. So regardless of climate change... why would we not switch over to renewable energy? We will have to eventually. \s\sWe should be focused on the long game.Fuck.Imagine being that dumb imagine being dumb enough to support someone that dumb. They must feel great being that fucking stupid blissful ignorance and incompetence... Dunning-Krugers every single one.It’s so perplexing to me how someone cannot agree with science. It just doesn’t make any sense to me.Science *does* know and we've been collectively SCREAMING IT FOR DECADES.He’s just so fucking stupidI still cannot believe that you guys chose this creature as your president.

He's such an asshole.This doesn’t make me cringe. This belongs in mildlyinfuriating. I’m so sick of this fuck.“I’ll be dead so fuck the environment.  My friends are making billions off my loosened EPA regulations and it keeps the stock market up”.Trump has a mental disorder.He is such a piece of shitHow Is he allowed to be the president even for a day.He has not been  right about anything  else why believe  him now. Look at covid on how it was a hoax and only 15 people  would die from it. ( his exact words) . He is a moron who doesn't like  factsPlain dumb fuck.I once had a history teacher in my high school in Texas who spent a good portion of our period one day during the 2008 election telling us that climate change is a myth because man can’t have an effect on something God created. It’s out of our power. I hated this class so much and I love history.Is donald trump just illiterate or agenda backed? I mean what kind of statement is thatHe gets away with this stupid shit all the time. People need to put him on the spot and push back on his throw out remarks. He needs to be challenged there and then. That Aussie reporter ""what books"" and Trump couldnt answer showing him up.Weather: ""Sure I'll get cooler. I'm going into the fall season here in the northern hemisphere.""\s\sTrump: ""See! I told you it would get cooler!""\s\sClimate: ""I'm so glad you're a moron and have many followers. I can't fix stupid but I sure as hell can kill it. Please by all means keep ignoring my existence. I want my planet back assholes.""At this point we need to start thinking about Trump in terms of crimes against humanity. We should not be thinking ""we need to vote him out"" we need to be thinking ""if we cannot get him out of office by any means and replace him with someone willing to take major steps on climate millions will die and society may collapse entirely"". Because that's a very different conversation and one that doesn't start or end with ""vote blue"".He’s such a dumb mother fucker. It’s more sad/upsetting than cringe at this point. \s\sHis inability to grasp basic concepts is literally getting people killed. From COVID to climate to cop reform. This dude is so insanely stupid anything he touches cases reckless amounts of damage. \s\sCongrats Putin ya fucking boomed us ya boomed us good.Pretty sure this breaks rule 3 about mentally ill people[deleted]Just look at people who voted for him.  I know a yuge Trump supporter who insists that if you cover up plants such a tomatoes during a frost advisory said plants will die from oxygen deprivation.  This guy was managing a Walmart garden center.  🤣We’ve been neglecting our election systems for decades and the GOP has perfected the art of cheating at them.I hope he is remembered for his lack of action against climate change. What a disgraceHow tf do people still support this guyThat smug fucking look on his face...Trump did it!  He predicted seasons!  What foresight.He’s not wrong though... it’ll just take tens of thousands of years for another ice age to startThis maniac is going to win again and I’m losing the will to liveThis is the leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world.And that scares the hell out of me. Not the fact that Trump is a narcissistic entitled asshole as the world is full of those. But that people like that can end up in such a position in a Western democratic nation is mind boggling to me.I'm so tired of this stupid motherfucker.Please vote this guy out.

How do they answer the fact that Hillary won the popular vote in 2016? Why didn't democrats bother to rig votes for the senate as well and only rigged presidential votes? Why bother to cheat the vote in historically red states like AZ and GA instead of only focusing on swing states? Also it's incredibly convenient that there was voter fraud only in states where Trump lost.

He lost. Its that simple. Im not sure why these people can't get it.I mean to be fair they likely see themselves the exact same way that we do on the other side; we’re both blind to the others viewpoint and pushed so far apart that we both think our side is obviously correct and the other side is being misled. We’re both building conclusions on entirely different sets of information. As a person who’s lived in a city his whole life I think we vastly misunderstand and misrepresent the viewpoint of people outside of cities. Part of this is intentional; when we always see them as ridiculous and idiotic because they have been driven into these eccentric viewpoints by their leader we fail to try to find empathy and see where they’re fundamentally coming from. Most humans share the same basic goals for society; we tend to focus on the outliers that we can ridicule to bolster our own points of view.[Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20psychologyrecognize%20their%20lack%20of%20ability)The one thing that stupid people don't realise is that they're stupid.  An advantage/disadvantage of low intelligence.Fuck it. Take every video these clowns have seen of people apparently destroying ballets times it by 5 and give Trump those votes.

I asked him where he gets his news and he said Facebook. Not even from news sources just from his friends on there. Willful ignorance is a massive problem in this country.I wish my friend would listen to me. Had a three hour chat on Saturday that culminated in him saying not a single news organization is trustworthy but you can find individuals that are trustworthy.That's what I liked about that big guys answer.\s\s'Where did you heard that?' \s\s'It's all over TikTok Facebook... Fox....

Took me way too long to break the addiction.If my thermometer of Canadian friends is worth anything that shit is spreading.

Any actual evidence will be dismissed and they'll pick up on nay conspiracy theory or bullshit they prefer the sound of.The stupidity here is insane.

There are normally more people working for the election commissions. But if you remember it wasn't long ago they were begging for workers. Then shortly afterward they announced this exact thing would happen. (That the vote wouldn't be fully counted on time like normal.)It is not uncommon to no finish the full count for months. Even when there wasn't record amounts of mail in ballots.  \s\sIt's just that most of the time the race isn't so close to have to worry about all the provisional ballots and mail in ballots.and the take away is that lot of Trump supporters *want* to think their side was cheated out of winning they'll believe anything that supports their view and actively reject anything that doesn't because they *want* to feel vindicated in their persecution. \s\sThey're probably also the same ones that will in a few weeks yell about a 'War on Christmas' and how Christians are being oppressed.You can’t help these people.

It does not compute.Louisiana went to Trump are they saying those were illegal votes?They can’t reason. I know this from personal experience. I connected with a family member from Michigan a couple months ago. They hate the governor there and are vocal about it. At one point they said they hoped Witmer would be Biden’s VP pic so “she would leave Michigan to go work with that pedophile sexual assaulter Biden.”\s\sI was like hold up? Trump was the one caught on national TV talking about grabbing women by the p***y about just walking into the dressing rooms at teen pageants the one constantly sexualizing his own daughter the one who has been accused of and sued for sexual misconduct in court.\s\sTheir response? Liberal media fake news. \s\sI shut it down and ended our conversation.I agree that these ppl are dumb but saying ""see they said it was a mistake"" and blindly believing that is hardly investigating or ""fact checking""I cannot even watch this.

I've talked to people like this irl and when you debunk *one* specific instance of misinformation (like the burning of Trump ballots) they'll quickly jump to another. Maybe it's human nature but once you have a notion in your head it's really hard to get out of that mindset. \s\sIdk what the solution is but I'm pretty concerned about the future of this country. The right has adopted such a self-destructive mentality. They seem to have no issue burning the country to the ground.I feel like if they jumped to another point at least THAT would be better than the lady who when confronted with the fact that they were sample ballots being burned still refuses to believe it and actually now probably believes it even harder.Its a defence mechanism. Their entire world view is going to shatter if the admit the simple fact Donald Trump lost - it ruins his popular and strong man image because they would finally have to accept that people did not like him and made him a 1-term president. It would also mean they would have to accept they got connedThe problem is that social media sites are designed to show you things that engage you...so it creates echo chambers of misinformation.\s\sThese people are so convinced of the lies because they’re not only being fed those lies but so it everyone else in their bubble.\s\sIf Facebook was banned in the US this shit would drop considerably.

It was always ""said something questionably true"" or ""gave inaccurate information."" What made them finally change the rulebook so they can finally accurately bluntly say he's lying?These people huff their own farts. Could have 100% proof in their face and they would still say it wrong.MAGA rubes do not deserve your respectAh yes. Speaking in keywords they heard trump say and Fox News say. But know nothing beyond that.I feel like a lot of these people just need to have a support group.Hey at least YouTube marked it as kids content so we don't need to see them crying in the commentsJust curious... Why in the hell did someone record themselves burning test ballots? Who were they? A trump supporter doing it on purpose to cause a stir?So does Fox News not go back and clarify that these stories are debunked? Or do they just present it and then do no follow up that it's been debunked. The 130k votes ballots of fire it's all a google search away but these people STILL believe it?

If they don't look for bias in the media and look for other sources of news and keep themselves in echo chamber they are stupid. \s\sBest poll I saw was for 1012 people were asked why they were voting for Biden.\s\s20% said they liked him for is platform\s80% said because they hated Trump\s\sThey don't seem to understand what a vile creature Trump has always been and always will be. They don't understand why celebrations have been going on in our own country and in countries allied to the US. Trump was universally hated. He is a despicable narcissistic human being. He does not understand compassion is unable to empathize or sympathize.I can't believe in the progress of this country is being held hostage by sell few brain cellsCan we speed up evolution?""I love the poorly educated""\s\sAnd they love you back Donald.how hard is it to think about what a massive undertaking opening millions of envelopes isI'm so depressed by these individuals being manipulated.Yes these people exist. Fucking christCognitive dissonance.The one lady talking about Steve Bannon was weird to me. For some reason I thought Steve Bannon was his own evil little thing and that even these people knew he was vile.\s\sSupporting Trump is one thing but Steve Bannon? That dude is so blatantly evil you would think he lived in a skull volcano.The blonde girl at the end has good point twitter and google algorithm is broken.\s\sIt will feed you with whatever you've look for beforehand. It's like on YouTube if you look for a  recipe and are involved in the tech community. You'll get tech video between recipe proposition... It doesn't make any sense.\s\sSame if you travel try to use google and you'll be heavily restricted on the news and research...That's how it's supposed to work. People don't like reading things that upset them.No shit. If youtube sees you really like idk Linus Tech Tips youll get a bunch of videos on building a PC and tech news. If youtube sees you like watching video game streamers youll get video game streamers reccomended""Is it possible that you guys have fallen for some misinformation like you think the Democrats have""\s\s""Oh no. I do my research. I'm definitely not an idiot""\s\sSays the idiot.The second someone actually cites Tik-Tok as their news source I immediately stop taking everything they say seriouslyThey’re just so stupid. So stupidTrump guy: There’s no way this happened\s\sCNN guy: here is how this happened\s\sTrump guy: ......NahLike he knows what the guy is saying is true and he himself probably refused to vote by mail because of how trump was trashing it and probably nobody he knows voted by mail either. \s\sBut nah.That was a straight up **no** to logic.“Where are all the trump mail in ballots?”\s\s“Trump literally told his supporters not to vote by mail.”\s\s“No.”\s\s\sThese fucking morons are lost.“If America ain’t first it’s last”From what I recall if all the counts stopped at midnight local time time Biden still would have won with 270 votes. NM and AZ would have put Biden at 270; PA NC GA and AK would have left Trump with 268. It would have been closer but not changed the result.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThis is like is like complaining about a bad call by a ref. But the call in question was with 0 seconds left on the clock and the losing team was down by 17. Even if the call went the other way the losing team still lost.That guy just denies Trump has been telling people not to vote by mail lolAll these people are the scum of America and it’s a shame they get a say in elections.I joined these groups on FB to troll. Then I stopped. I felt so bad for these people. The amount of indoctrination is scary. Everything shared was fact checked but they completely disregarded it and did not care. They are revolting against FB because they don't want to be fact checked.This is what's terrifying about the Trump presidency. We now have an entire subset of cult minded fools who won't believe reporters (fake news) won't believe any acting officials (deep state) and won't even believe their own ""eyes and ears"" for anything they've witnessed first hand. Trump has these people conditioned to take his word alone as the undeniable truth and that level of brainwashing won't be overcome so easily.\*akimbo wielding flags in a trump hat\* : ""I see the videos on tiktok""  \s\s\snice dope news source.I’m laughing MY ASS OFF at the grocery bag of sample ballots that’s supposedly gonna save his presidency!!!!!Iirc they're were 80 sample ballots in there. Gonna need a few more bags to make up that 5 million (popular) vote lead President-elect Joe Biden currently hasTENS OF THOUSANDS!!I want to know who the hell thought it’d be a good idea to film that and then POST IT ONLINE??This video made me officially lose my faith in humanity. Seeing the people at r/conservative and other right-wing subs made me shake my head but this video just epitomised the complete idiocy of this entire situation. You have half the population 150% convinced that they are geniuses and ONLY they can see the truth and the other side is completely brainwashed. They believe the left are all low-information voters and they're perfectly rational and intelligent people. Nothing will ever convince them otherwise and they they refuse to believe ANY fact check or story against the narrative they've been fed. \s\sWhat's worse is they KNOW they're being manipulated yet will fight to the death that their manipulation is correct but everyone else's is wrong. \s\sI'm a liberal and I fully accept that I have fallen for Fake News and been manipulated by political agendas but I've learned from it and now vehemently fact check things from different sources before repeating it as fact (including from conservative sources to see the other side). These people in the video have been so masterfully manipulated they think they're infallible and will never ever admit fault. \s\sPersonally I think it's because the right wing media keeps them in such an intense state of fight-or-flight fear that they've lost the ability to act on anything other than instinct and are unable to switch off their amygdala for long enough to change their minds. \s\sThe strongest chains are the chains of the mind truly.70+ million of these motherfuckers out there. Jesus Christ.  \s\sAnd they breed. Holy shit.They should have got Jordan Kleeper for this.Ultimately their reactions boil down to just saying ""no"" in the face of facts and reality.God get lives people. Seriously this is just sad.This is *exactly fucking why* educating the fuck out of people is a matter of national security.Holy shit these people are morons of insane proportions.Christ that was hard to watch.I couldnt even get 2 minutes into this horseshit I hope these hillbillies cry themselves to deathThese are the same people who probably think the earth is flat.God these people are so braindead it’s unbelievable.You can thank the dialysis king for this kind of stupidity.I gat all my news from facebook tictok fox and local stations....Yep that's all I need!look at all these triggered snowflakesIf you are getting all your news from Fox Facebook and TikTok it's safe to assume you know nothing about what's really going on.There is absolutely nothing you can do to convince those fucked up individuals of the most basic facts.  Fucking forget about it.At 4:31\s\s""Where are all the Trump ballots that were mailed in? Why aren't we finding them laying around in different places?""\s \s""But Trump was telling everybody not to mail it in right? That's why there's so much more mail-in Democratic votes.""\s\s""naaa^aaa itsss... no""\s\sShit I think he got us.That dudes whole life and identity is a Trumper and owning the libs.\sHis Facebook or IG says something along the lines of “MAGA. God. Guns. And owning the libs. Don’t fuck with my rights or you’ll be sorry.”LmaoHasn’t Fox News even told these people to stop?Wouldn't they tho.\s\sI'm dyingI can guarantee you their ""source"" is whatever they chose it to be.  It is increasingly difficult to sort through the news and determine what is skewed by opinion these days.  And the worst place to go for unbiased information is social media.  And every single one of those people got their information from social media.This would be sad if it wasn’t so pathetic.Sounds like something GLADoS would sayIf someone was going to secretly steal and set a plastic bag’s worth of Trump votes on fire why would they film it and post it online? And how is a single plastic bag’s worth of votes going to change anything anyway? These people lack brain function.I watched a few minutes and tried to see if I could at least understand where they're coming from and I couldn't do it. It gave me a headache just watching this.I have such a hard time wrapping my head around the way these people think.\s\sLike...literally believing that the more probable answer is that an election official filmed themselves burning a bag of ballots and then posting it online and bragging about it rather than somebody printed off sample ballots and burned them to spark outrage and dissonance.\s\sOr that somehow millions of physical ballots should be magically counted in a matter of hours.\s\sIt is pure stupidityThat small bag contains the 4 million votes DT needs to win!!Yea and then when election officials confirm that it’s fake then of course that just means they’re in on it. There’s no debating them. Their opinion is right facts and statistics are wrong and anyone who says other wise is in on it.They’ll never be satisfied until they get what they want. If hella froze over and trump won they would’ve seen no error in any system. But since they didn’t get their way the world is against them Biden cheated and everything is unfair.Right. Project Veritas has a video right now of his team “discovering” trashed mail in ballots. \s\s\sWhat they actually did:\s\sRequest mail in. Vote in person. Fill in mail in. Tear up mail in. Toss in trash. Roll the camera. Uncovered tossed out mail ins. \s\sThat fucker needs another criminal charge.These people make up about half of our population apparently... As long as social media and the media channels keep peddling bullshit they'll be around to choke it down.\s\sThe only way i see real change is if the left gets ahold of the senate and just implements thier platform... Once enough people see thier kids or spouses getting medical help when needed or realizing losing thier job doesn't mean they have medical help.. eventually it will start to seep in...Well I hate to start with the conclusion like they are so fond of doing *but* if we start with the conclusion that they are morons with the most profoundly provincial and unsophisticated thinking you have ever seen then suddenly it makes a lot more sense.This the part I couldn't handle. If someone wanted to to burn a bunch of ballots to hurt Trump why in the fuck would they video it and put it on the internet? They would counteract their goal?'You're wrong go. I don't even want to talk to you.'\s\sWell I'm glad I could stop watching less than 30 seconds in; that quote tells me everything I need to know about the rest of the video.Instead of “you’re wrong because here let me show you in the Constitution here...” No it’s “you’re wrong go waaah waaahh you make me sad and angry for showing me the truth.” They never left the toddler mental phase. No wonder they love shitstain TrumpWhat's the difference between misinformation and disinformation?Basically misinformation is when you’re wrong but disinformation is when you’re wrong on purpose.[deleted]Ooh ooh if I post that I'm the queen of the world would some people believe it? I wanna be queen! Honestly all I want is someone to feed me grapes everywhere I go and pet me and tell me I'm pretty.not only that but they talk a lot about ""being aware of the issues"" and ""questioning everything even the election officials"" but fail to make the simple question: why would a person who was burning Trump ballots post about it on social media? What would they have to gain? Wouldn't they want to keep that fact as secret as possible?I asked some proof of fraud from someone a few days ago and got ten Tiktoks of people doing things with paper at a place.  No context of where or when or what they were doing.  But apparently that’s voter fraudYeah my sister said she isn't watching Fox News anymore; she gets better information on Instagram and Parler.\s\sDo tell.No one should get any information from tik tok.Imagine going out to protest something you are not fully sure of...These people have anger but they just direct it to the easiest thing to lay it on.Jesus Christ. We are doomed.This is just exhausting to watch at this point. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.These Americans just look like a giant bunch of babies who throw a tantrum every time they don't get what they want.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sEdit: Not to mention how dumb these people look every time they open their mouths. That first chick is on a whole new level of stupid.Why is the Greendale Human Being in the back ground at 3:20? And what in the fuck does the sign saySome people think “evidence” is some person going on YouTube and talking about things.[deleted]“But trump discouraged mail in voting so that’s why most mail in votes are for democrats”\s\s“...nah”\s\sLmaoImagine if media was doing this for the last 20-25 years. Might have avoided a few things.What a brave man. Openly speaking with the most ill-informed uneducated conspiracy spouting God damn idiots you'll ever meet. Wild.The problem with these people is they all think they're the smartest people in the room where in reality they're actually the dumbest and those people are the most stubborn people on the planetThe Dunning-Kruger effect in full display hereThis is a fantastic lesson in motivated reasoning.Those people can barely form coherent sentences let alone explain their thought process behind it.The morons who think election night is a tv show which ends at midnight are the ones I like the most.\s\sLike ""ah well all these votes that came in today...whichever ones we get to by the end of the night are the ones which count...""\s\sThat shouldn't even make sense to the thickest of the thickest.4 years ago they told us all to get over it so why can't they get the fuck over it.Lmao dude said he’s seen the videos on tiktok.Anyone have the Venn diagram of these joiners and the flat earthers?It's just a single circle.""TRUMP. IS STILL. YOUR PRESIDENT.""\s\sHe sure is buddy. Keep yellin while you can.Yeah like... no one is arguing that lol. I’m not sure what his point is but I hope he gets it out of his system over the next couple months.inbred trailer trashSo they would seriously believe that someone who wants to help biden win by burning a handful of trump ballots and committing voter fraud would just record a video and post it online? IncredibleImagine what could be done if these people put that amount of enthusiasm towards stuff that actually mattered.Modern American conservatism is a mental disorder.There's been studies that show lower cognitive ability in conservatives.I just can't understand it I am barely left of center but the fact that 70 million people would vote for Donald Trump breaks my brain. \s\sPeople actually drive to his rallies to hear him talk. If I listened to Trump talk for more than 60 seconds I am in physical pain.“So where are all the Trump mail-in votes?”  \s“But Trump was telling everybody not to mail it in right?”  \s“N-nahhh that’s... no...”  \s\sI fucking diedI asked a Dominican friend who supports Trump to give me a source for some claims he was making. He gave me a link to the Hodgetwins and another link to Trump War Room YouTube page. We aren't really friends anymore. The problem with these people is that they don't care to fact check anything the don't care which media outlet is saying one thing of the other they turned on Fox News in a heart beat. To them Trump is the truth and the only truth.This shit hurts so bad.... fucking embarrassingI feel really sad for these people. But then I think about those hundreds of separated families that wanted amnesty. Fuelling these policies of cruelty with discriminatory and demonizing rhetoricThis is why we have courts. Trump has bragged about how many judges he appointed and there are a ton of judges out there who were appointed by Bush. The court system isn’t some deep state liberal conspiracy. \s\sThe judges so far have laughed these cases out of court saying Trump hasn’t even tried to submit any actual admissible evidence.It’s crazy how easily these people believe Trump with either shady evidence or little to no evidence but when presented with facts and official reports they question that? \s\sWhere’s the logic here?God that first woman... the entitlement people have to being wrong.Willful ignoranceWow. The utter lack of self awareness is breathtaking. The guy says he carefully researches his views and doesn’t spread misinformation while literally being fact-checked for spreading disinformation that he clearly didn’t take the time to even google search. The woman says that she is concerned about people not thinking for themselves while blindly parroting what she saw on social media. The projection is unreal.The more you present facts to these brainwashed fools the more they dig in. They are a lost cause.Its crazy how you can tell just how braindead these people are from a 30 second interviewThe lady at 4:55 is prime /r/SelfAwarewolves materialShe's \*so close\* to getting it.[deleted]QUESTION EVERYTHING!\s\sOK why would people destroying trump ballots film it and post it online?I mean she is what the whole Trump movement is a constant contradiction.Pot? Is that you? It’s kettle speakingDoes anyone know what this person’s costume is supposed to be?! [NIGHTMARE-FUEL](https://i.imgur.com/gMFEwre.jpg)I hate to say it but a lot of Trump supporters are flat-out incorrect and ignorant. I say ignorant because I believe they believe their bullshit. It’s sad but what can you do?\s\sWhat is it about this conman they connect with so much? Watching rural blue collar workers devote so much energy to a NYC socialite who’s never worked a day in his life is mind boggling. He doesn’t care about them at all but they all think he’s “their guy”.\s\sThey are willing to toss out an election - based on nothing - just because the idiot in chief tells them he was robbed. You can’t win with facts because then they’ll just say it’s all manufactured deep state conspiratorial BS.It's the same type of peeps who believe that stripper likes them or that they can beat the odds in Vegas and they will throw away all their money to try and prove it.The rabid Trumpies are not going to believe he lost no matter what.  They have invested to much time and energy into turning this con man into a near religious figure in thier minds that to admit they were wrong would shatter their egos.Kind of crazy to see this not as a Daily Show segment but a CNN segment. It's just heart wrenching without the laugh track.It felt like All Gas No Brakes.Not a POC in sightOr a mask other than the reporter.Now that the rich people have these losers completely enslaved it’s only a matter of time for America. I no longer believe in this country.Isn't the popular narrative out of /r/conservative and what not that republicans would go back to work today *unlike us jobless dems LOL* ?Trump lost get over it“question everything right?”\suntil you get your way...What they want to say: “we rigged and cheated it so hard that we know they had to cheat more to compensate”Her buddy Steve Bannon told her? My buddy Fred Flintstone told me and even demonstrated that he could stop his car with only his feet.[what the heck is this thing? ](https://i.imgur.com/HPWUGkg.jpg)I find this truly fascinating that people can argue so strongly against factual information. It must be a strong case of denial and stupid lol. It also goes to show how infectious a false idea can truly be. A false idea spreads faster than the fucking corona virus among these morons.I argued with a group of girls at college once trying to prove that ""fight or flight"" was real stating that ""some people during dangerous situations will freeze"". They all laughed and banded together and would not listen to reason their little group gave them the ignorant power they needed.I think a lot of it comes down to wanting excuses for their own hardships/lives/mistakes. Right wing politics usually offers a lot more of ""it's not your fault it's the [foreigners/Black/Hispanic/Muslims/Jews/..."" rhetoric that people like this can attach to and use as an excuse for their own shitty life. Couple that with the lie that hard work can make you a billionaire just like the politicians/wealthy who actually benefit from right wing politics and it's inevitable that a large band of poor morons will behave like this. \s\sWe have the same here in Britain. Brexit was sold in the same way - taking back from the foreigners and making Britain great again when in reality it's already put thousands out of work and will only continue to ruin lives as more industry leaves the UK and the small group behind it start to benefit from leaving the EU.  \s\sAnd no I'm not saying that left wing politicians are angels sent to help the people before someone goes off on that tangent.And of course Trump supporters do not wear masks.Jesus they treat him like a fucking cult leader.It's all fun and games until these people get violentthis convinces me we ought to have a semi-presidential government system like France Germany or Ireland... the President has way too much power and influence as both head of state *and* head of governmentSo does the Senate.  We should have a no party system and just merge the House and Senate.  We should also redo the whole constitution. Why are we still following laws from the 1700's?what a crazy stupid world we live inThis reporter did a really good job of staying neutral and non-confrontational.She is my heroOof can smell the smoke from all the bridges she’s burnedThis is hardly a ""career"". There are little if any chances for significant progress. Most of the news is recycled or pulled from feeds and directives are predetermined. Every story is edited and most reporters spend a limited time with the same station. She would probably make more progress running her own weed shop but overall it's pretty trashy for her to blast her opinion in a news piece. Broadcast news is garbageLOL [She runs one of those get rich schemes now](http://charlogreene.com/).""Pardon for us"" lol. I feel bad for the news reporter that had to follow that.Didn't she have some kind of shady reasons for doing this? Like she had an ownership stake in a cannabis company or somethingShe says in the report that she owns the Cannabis Club.Woodbury my dickUhh.. does she expect support for her cause after that? Like it wasnt super egregious or anything but what was she trying to accomplish? I really dont understand.They might have given her a ultimatum because of a conflict of interest.  Get rid of your weed business or be fired.  She might have chose to go down the marijuana path and use it as a opportunity for free publicity. I’m just guessing here though.What do you think egregious means?This is far from cringe shes badassThis isn’t cringe this is a super classic clip of an epic moment on television. Surprised people still haven’t seen this yet lolhow is this cringe?  \sthat was great.It seems great on the surface but there's so much more going on here. [She actually did an AMA on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5dgxde/im_charlo_greene_the_alaskan_news_anchor_who_said/da4et37?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) a few years ago after this incident and she got destroyed in the comments.

Apologies for the disappointment folks.I mean yay pot but that feels so impulsive and poorly thought out in regards to the consequences long term. Like someone else said the kind of thing you do in college or high school not in your thirties when you're supposed to have learned these lessons the hard way already.That was childish. Seems like something a college/high school kid dreamed of doing.What's great about it? It's unprofessional gives the station a bad reputation... for no reason. It's selfish.She’s rightI remember seeing this on the news in my hometown anchorage like a decade ago. She is a legend not cringe.She's a terrible person."

Living it bearing witness to every fucking day from one patient to the next and being helpless as a provider. Then having to watch neoliberals like @PeteButtigieg @JoeBiden and @AmyKlobuchar lie about health care.\s>\sThere's nothing worse than having to turn a patient away because they can't afford their 20% or they haven't met their deductible. Our office staff has paid so many $3 Medicaid copays because many of our patients are so poor they can't even afford $3.Bernie is the only one out there fighting his ass off to make sure people get the care they need WITH NO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. Anything else like Biden's ""affordable Healthcare"" or Warren's ""access to healthcare"" are bullshit versions of M4A. Maybe just maybe if we had M4A right now we wouldn't have to see people like this poor man go through this. The system as it stands at this moment doesn't give a shit about you or me and will continue to rip us off for profits.Yep. Only Bernie seems to understand that for many people- including people who can own a car or rent an apartment by themselves- *any* medical expense is too much. We're not talking a few bucks here and there if you're insured. We're talking hundreds or thousands every time anything beyond a basic doctor's visit happens and that's for the people paying ridiculous premiums which would be vastly lowered (and proportionate to income) under M4A. \s\sPeople making 40-60K might be able to afford a monthly premium from a private insurer but they sure as hell can't afford to pay a premium *and then* pay co-pays and a deductible and stay in a ""network"" and pay expenses when an insurer disputes them and argue with the company they *paid* to provide coverage in order to get them to do so et al. \s\sThere is no solution that doesn't involve *zero* out of pocket costs at the point of service considering the hole we've dug ourselves into as a society over the past fifty years. We will never build a German-style (semi-public) system with 7% job unionization rates extortion at every level of the HC industry hundreds of thousands of bankruptcies and tens of thousands of dead people every year.

However he wanted to unite them under both the rainbow flag and the DNC banner all the way back in the early to mid 1970s. \s\sMike is right:  They are still being denied to one degree or another. We had a Democratic AG for eight years recently.  As Obama's re-election approached he challenged states that were denying voting rights under the Voting Rights Act a statute.  Did he challenge states that were denying reproductive choice rights under the Supreme Law of the land though? No.     Menendez the Corrupt talked of resurrecting the ERA in time for the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.  Remember the great efforts he made? Neither do i. So much for women.\s\sSame AG during the first few years of the Obama administration continued the Bush practice of conflating bestiality and pedophilia with homosexuality. And Obama also stalled repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell until after the 2020 midterms while soldiers were getting persecuted and dischared.\s\sThen Obama's run for re-election approached and the HRC had a heart to heart with Obama about re-election efforts and the role of gay voters and gay bundlers in the fortunes of Democratic candidates--despite DADT and DOMA.  And Obama's thoughts on equal marriage evolved back to his 1994 position. For her part Hillary after supporting DADT and DOMA and speaking on the Senate floor against equal marriage also ""evolved""--about ten days before the Supreme Court made public its decision that the equal rights amendment applied to equal marriage. It was almost as if someone leaked that info to her. And gays are still discriminated against in jobs and other contexts. \s\sI could go on in each category that made up Milk's rainbow coalition but this is already too long.\s\sSo yes Mike is right.  They're still Denied nearly fifty years after Harvey Milk tried to unite them under the Democratic Party.  ""Centrist"" my ass.  ""Moderate"" my ass.  They are elite Republicans.   This is the time to end the current reality that MOST Americans are still being denied. \s\sIf not now when?  Fifty years from now?  Another few hundred?  More?

That’s almost half of my daily income!It's an odd translation that doesn't necessarily have a 1:1 meaning in English I think.  ""Lebensmittel"" is often used for everyday food/groceries you get from the supermarket.  Groceries would sound a little awkward here too - perhaps a better translation would be food supply?  Though that might have other implications too.\s\sFoodstuffs is an English term but I feel (at least in American English) it's not used often enough to not have ambiguity by the watcher.[Here](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/how-nestle-starved-a-bunch-of-85687280/) is a great podcast by Behind the Bastards about how nestle starved (may still be going on) literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of babies.Peter Bareback is an asshole for his views. I get there are those who'd agree by saying that we're not paying for the water we're paying for the quality. As the public how are we supposed to attest to the quality being served? Are we supposed to be grateful that in a civilized society we are able to drink water that doesn't have parasites in it? Water being a finite resource that is slowing becoming more and more scarce should absolutely be seen as a public right rather than some profitable thing that gets pumped and abused until there's nothing left. In California there's already talk of there being ""water refugees"" who will have to leave the state due to the lack of water. All of these things must be taken into account before corps can continue making millions off of spring water.CEOs like this should be taxed into poverty.  Think of it as the public-market taking advantage of a discovered commodity and mining that resource until it is gone.We could drop him in the desert and charge him 5% of his net worth for every liter of water he needs.Tell me you’re an asshole without telling me you’re an asshole.\s\sI’ve yet to see Nestle doing anything good for humanity.This is the company stealing millions of gallons of water from the Great Lakes.

In that mix is both predatory and non predatory mentalities. Co-ops were the way here for agri businesses before mostly US buyouts and are making a comeback cz predatory capitalism model has failed to provide. Some say you can’t have co-ops that make money. I think what makes co- ops powerful is shared responsibility shared returns with shared power where every one has a voice and space is made to support the individual within the agreed ways and means.

There's many people that need water and for humanity's sake every person should have the right to water.\s\sAt the same time a cost of some type needs to be associated with the it.  Without a cost to water it can be abused by the receiving party (versus the supply party on the other end of the scale).  There's infrastructure and logistics involved in the proper treatment of clean water.  Only focusing on the receiving end is fairly short-sighted thinking IMO.  Someone/some entity needs to be paid to extract the resource/bring it up to regulation (i.e. cleaning/transporting safely).  Now ideally government-funding (whole tangent topic in itself) would probably be the most reasonable IMO but this still follows his points about needing to associate/put a cost on water itself.\s\sIt's looking a lot like a government failure if the people's right to water cannot be fulfilled and not necessarily the entities/providers (though that's also a rather blanket statement itself since the entities could abuse/run through loop holes).\s\sEdit: Though re-watching it it's clear he has a very biased view calling one side ""extreme"" and sounding neutral on the other.

So long as the water you try to take claim over comes from a mountain or from the rain its not yours its every living being's water.So let me get this straight. Water which covers the majority of this planet is a “foodstuff” which has *value. *value = money. *Value ≠ importance for survival. A bit strange but let’s continue. “Those that can afford to pay for this foodstuff should take “specific measures” to ensure access to those that can’t afford it. So youNestle the company with the ability to offer water to those that can’t afford it aren’t going to help others because money.

It looks more like a Nestle play to gather public money.Drinkable water is also rare actually. Or not so common everywhere. And technology to distillate water is not electricity free exactly. There is few real issues on water for free consept. I think un was talking about this and declaring that 60 liter should be granted to all dailyElectricity is neither free to make nor to transport yet it’s classified as a public utility pretty much everywhere. If the government isn’t directly providing it then they are partnering with private companies to supply it. Water is treated pretty much exactly the same. Nestle doesn’t take water from developed nations supplies they steal from places they know don’t have the resources to fight against them subjecting the people there unfairly to a lower quality of life compared to anywhere else.How could you possibly say access to clean water for all people is an extremist viewpoint. I mean it’s *extreme*ly correct butYea I don’t disagree with situations that companies bottle and provide water for a profit but what really gets my goat is when they take it to an extreme like nestle (and others) and it rapes the environment and interferes with people’s ability to access water for free especially people who cannot afford to pay for processed/cleaned/bottled water.Fcken Neanderthal.

This is the way of all capitalistic companies.I’m not convinced he deserves all the hate he is getting based on this video alone. He is right in some sense. Cold but factual. Water is not free it has a cost it is precious and therefore should be cherished and valued we should not waste the precious resource. Unfiltered untreated and left to nature there is not an endless supply of drinking water or clean water. Many systems and people work tirelessly to ensure that water is available to many. However I am not in favour of it ever being exploited. It should absolutely be available to ALL at a price that is never expensive. Who am I kidding FUCK NESTLEThis is one of those ""Hitler was anti-smoking"" moments...\s\sEven bad people can be correct. Just because they state a true fact for evil reasons doesn't mean the fact isn't true anymore. \s\sWhen this happens don't pretend they're not fact work with the truth there are ways to show they are bad and fight the bad things they do without denying reality...Water should be a guaranteed thing. If you need to drink you should have access to clean potable water at no cost because you will die if you don't. Any system that favors money over lives is a system that creates pollution and ruins what water is available in the first place.Cake is ""foodstuff.""  Oreos are ""foodstuff.""\s\sWater is an essential substance for human life to exist.\s\sFuck this guy with an extra crispy and rigid Nestle Crunch bar.Fuck this Nazi scum and while I’m at it Fuck Nestle!Next he will say oxygen is foodstuffThis is bs.

But it amuses me how terrified Americans are of being accused of the thought crime ""conspiracy theory.""  \s\sEven though American history (at least since the Cold War) has been one conspiracy after another; tens of thousands of ""conspiracies"" validated by the internal records of NSS institutions themselves: CIA/FBI etc.  Conspiracy is what they do.   Hence the billion dollar black budgets.   \s\sWatching/reading the corporate media you would think that suspecting election fraud is on par with believing there is a race of Sasquatches living on the moon and controlling the thoughts of the Lochness monster.   Despite the Podesta emails.   Methinks this confusion is [intentional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generoso_Pope) -- another conspiracy theory!  \s\sLook folks.  Even Chomsky who is notoriously averse to anything approaching ""conspiracy theory"" -- noted in the 1980's that the term is a propaganda device.   His recommendation: stop using it.   It discourages institutional analysis.   It's a cop-out.  \s\sBut what about the apparently outlandish idea of powerful people meeting in ""smoke-filled rooms""?   Just like thousands of real conspiracies that were in fact concocted during the Cold War?  Well it *is* outlandish but only because today's hipster tech geeks and IDPOL environmental stewards would demand that the offending party go outside to smoke.   Not because the premise is outlandish: as the Marxist Michael Parenti wrote ""where else are they going to meet -- on carousels!?""   \s\sSo the pavlov dogs will continue to bark ""conspiracy theory"" even as the corruption is plain as day and even as the US sinks ever deeper into the morass of tinpot dictatorship territory.**Generoso Pope**\s\sGeneroso Pope (April 1 1891 – April 28 1950) was an Italian-American businessman and the owner of a chain of Italian-language newspapers in major American cities.\s\s***\s\s^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\s^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28This should be stickied.Besides how upset this makes me that truly no political party in this country represents the actual people just slightly different groups of oligarchs I watched this and thought “this is so well done clear objective and fact-based reporting why in the world isnt this how all of our news is?”\s\sUnfortunately in our county the media have decided that if the facts support one candidate you are biased to say so - which has led to the clusterfuck news reporting we have in this country and contributed tacitly to so many of the problems we presently have.Is that her actual name???Yeah man it is...When she was at MSNBC I completely rolled my eyes and never watched because the combination of her name and the network screamed clickbait and shallow gimmick.\s\sI regret that now because her and Saager's content is consistently solid representative of issues that MSM just ignores and presented in a professional way.[deleted]was with you until \s\s>First Bottom\s\sSaint Bernard would not condone homophobic jokesI know it's the hill but it taste like propaganda.

0,Political_Revolution,Enough_Sanders_Spam,251,"[deleted]Such bullshit. Apparently interviewing a total of 12 Democrats licenses pronouncements on the Dems general feelings about Hillary.   Bu Bu Bu... they were *unanimous*!!!!\s\sAbout made me toss my phone into wall...And it was actually 12 political insiders not Democratic voters. It says more about the state of our politics than about Hillary Clinton. We are fractured as hell.[deleted]Problematically interviewing them would probably reveal support for Hillary...I was so mad when I read that article. The Russia story is big news now. I defy anyone in her position to refrain from commenting on it. I was a little surprised by her remarks about the DNC but hey. She knows more about that subject than I do. To my mind they weren't very helpful to her during the campaign.Yes but it's also frustrating that people think this article ONLY represents the views of Berniecrats. I would love for her to run for President in 2020 but I also worry that she will eat up the support of other Democrats who are the future of the party. \s\sCorey Booker Andrew Cuomo Eric Garcetti Kristen Gillibrand Tammy Duckworth John Hinkenloper are all guys who I would love to see run for President. It would be a shame if they sit 2020 out because Clinton runs I voted for her but I don't want her to run again. That isn't to say I don't want her as an ""elder statesman"" though: she can talk in public and be a part of the Democratic party without getting in the way of others who might want to run for President in 2020.[deleted]The only people I have heard talking about Hillary running in 2020 are Berniebros decrying that she shouldn't. I haven't heard any actual real Democrats advocating for a third presidential run for her.\s\sI don't want Hillary 2020. What I DO want is for Hillary to be able to speak publicly without being told to sit down and shut up.[removed]Fuck off No-regard.He won on basically a technicality; if the electoral college didn't exist she'd be president today. More people voted for her and that's a fact.\s\sHow does this square into your ""everyone hates her so she lost"" narrative? >She ran a lousy incompetent messageless uninspiring campaign and lost to the vilest laziest least qualified most mendacious most overtly racist candidate in American history!!!.\s\sWhat are you talking about she did beat Bernie! Oh wait you're talking about Trump. \s \sIf only she had the foresight to have her own foreign government help her out along with government officials willing to leak letters about Trump...\s\s>Hillary approval ratings are even below Trump’s - still.\s\sWhat does that say about our voters... And by the by Hillary's highest approval ratings (which were here normal approval ratings only 3 years ago) will NEVER be reached by neither Bernie nor Trump.\s\sGet the fuck out with your trolling shit you're horrendous at it. And nice username by the way. Really showcases how much you care about racist candidates.Oh hai guyz. Betsy devos is about to fuck over public schools and Detroit public school buildings have caved in ceilings and no heat but yay free college man. College is fairly easy to make free when no one will be qualified to attend one.And naturally S4P and Political Revolution don't care.[deleted]Isn't post secondary education watered down enough? Jesus Christ; it's gonna be another high school.When the Berners pull the ""(insert favorite country or region of the day here) has free college for their citizens why can't we?"" I just point out that the reason they can afford to do it outside of taxes is by raising the bar of qualifications in order to partake.  In order for it to work here the same would have to apply meaning the already disenfranchised will become more so.  They don't care about that but what they don't realize is many of them and  their future children aren't guaranteed to make the cut themselves and they'd be railing against the ""establishment yet again.  Hillary had the better plans with her K-12 (every zip code) and her debt free plan.  (In my opinion that is)This is what I've always thought. I'm actually not in favor of free college; I think we should be encouraging a more comprehensive high school education and access to good trade schools so that everyone will be stronger intellectually at 18 and can eventually obtain reasonably well-paying jobs. If everyone goes to college for free it'll completely de-value a college degree making employment virtually impossible and there'll be a severe shortage of people for other jobs that don't require college.It may as well be already. A bachelor's is the minimum requirement on most job listings I've seen. It doesn't get you very far.[deleted]A lot of Sanders' plans are basically Hillary's plans but badly written impossible to implement and obviously much worse.https://i.imgur.com/jhg73Ej.jpg""Were going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it"" far right\s\s""Were going to make college free and we're going to make wall street pay for it"" far left\s\sOMG BOTH SIDES ARE THE SAME!!!This fucking charlatan...for fuck's sake...This sounds like a great idea.... let's look first at the State school system in Pennsylvania though.  The system is failing because there aren't enough students.  Schools are cutting staff programs and combining already as is because not enough people want to go to them.  It's not because of the cost.  It's because people don't think that it's a quality education.  So how does Bernie's plan address this?  I don't think you understand the plan.  Let me give you the simple version:\s\sFREE. COLLEGE.\s\sGet it now?[deleted]> So she borrowed from him and now he's borrowed from her in some respects that IS how good policy eventually forms. \s\sI agree but that is not even remotely how the BernieBros portrayed it when Hillary released her plan. And now they've totally erased her from the policy. Oh Bernie great idea on the financial transaction tax.  Let's look at what happened when other countries tried it:\s\s>As a result revenues from these taxes were disappointing. For example revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.[3] In addition as taxable trading volumes fell so did revenues from capital gains taxes entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax\s\s>Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax the volume of bond trading fell by 85% even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.[1] 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990 more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades.\s\sAnd he's proposing a higher rate!\s\sSanders is a gibbering idiot.Yes and it doesnt help when people are getting college degrees for a job that the markets aint offering. Free college doesnt fix that.I actually was talking to a friend about sanders' free college plan today and how his only response to ""how do we pay for it"" is ""WALL STREET!"" I actually joked to him ""He talks about Wall Street the same way Hitler talked about the Jews."" Of course I was only joking but I have this feeling Bernie doesn't know what Wall Street actually is and just sees it as an amalgamation of bad things.This shit again?\s\s[r/badeconomics  showed why Bernie's plan is shit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4cr2f1/the_bad_economics_in_bernies_college_plan/)Fucking asshole. \s\shttp://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/hillary-clinton-policy-agenda/My first reaction - ""Wow never thought The Nation would actually give Hillary some credit"".\s\sYou bamboozled me GB!Sanders has to make his mind up on the FTT either being Pigouvian or for revenue And after Congress stops laughing what's he going to ask for next Unicorns that fart rainbows? Could you people possibly be more dishonest?\s\s> The College for All Act is substantially the same as his campaign plan though the income cut-off is new. \s\s>  When Clinton released an updated tuition plan after the primary was over it borrowed many of Sanders’s subsidized-tuition elements but also had a $125000 income threshold. Oh so you're saying that we should support it because it took the best ideas from Clinton's plan and merged it with the best ideas of Sanders' plan? And we should come together because we agree and this is what a compromise looks like? Where were you in July?\s\sFuck you.The finger. I hate the finger pointing ‘What is dead may never die but shitposts again harder and stronger.’\s\s—E_S_S 2/19/19Who the fuck announces they’re running for President at 6:45am on a Tuesday?Someone with pathetically bad political intuitionSomeone who doesn't want to answer any questions or be seen because they know the idea of him is way better than anything else he could possibly show for himself.Most of us are getting ready for work at 6:45. Given that he doesn’t work he probably doesn’t understand this concept. Also given that it was 6:45 eastern time that means everybody on Mountain and Pacific time were asleep so... awkward?Someone who is running to ratfuck not to win.I like how he didn't even do it when most of California was awake. He knows we don't support him. Yeah I thought it was a joke at first. He not only picked a bad time of day but also a bad time of week since the news broke of the NC voting scandal and the border wall suits just lately. Lol.What time is that in Russia? Someone who eats dinner at 3:30pm.With a boring press release no lessHave to get up early for the early-bird special.Someone who wants to make sure he makes it to the Early Bird Special To be fair yesterday was president's day. An old-ass man who doesn't know shit about politics.Maybe he was targeting a time zone on the other side of the globe?The Bernie shills are out in full force in the politics sub.Whelp. I guess it time to unsubscribe until after the election again. That sub wasn't even bearable for the news last time.Fifty golds and counting within two hours. I’d be fine with their energy if it was all positive.just like that  it became uninhabitable again.. I'm sad.DAE DWS?Ugh.\s\sIf he wins the primary Bernie will be our nominee.\s\sIf he doesn't win the primary he will refuse to drop out and drag the Dem nominee down with him again.But can't you see it's HIS turn as he's entitled to the Presidency ?\s\sThe only way he can't win is if the Democratic Party (you know the one he only conveniently joins when an election year is nearing) robs him again of his right to the Oval Office brought by rainbows of better days to come and free stuff to give.Either way bernie being in the race will increase the likelihood of a trump victory.  [deleted]I hate the brinkmanship of these candidates (Bernie isn't the only one but he's the worst). Dems should implement a rule that candidates should be required to drop out when it's mathematically impossible for them to win the primary. We knew this was coming.The worst part is if he wins the nomination he has a good chance of winning the general and if he wins the general his base will talk endlessly about how it's proof that he would have won in 2016.\s\sIt really is a lose-lose situation having him run.There's like 50 other candidates this time.  When he looses they will drop him like a bad habit because they have actually have other people to cover this go around.I love how people are just so eager to repeat 2016. They didn't learn anything at all. Strategically Bernie running is a shit decision that will only influence the election cycle negatively. I unsubscribed from this sub 2 years ago.  Honestly it felt good.  As much as I hated Barnyard Sandals and his narcissistic bullshit it felt great to step aside and feel like we'd won.  The world didn't need ESS anymore. \s\sWell....

She gonna rip him a new one.Is that quote from today? I would have thought by now he would at least know to say the diverse field of candidates is a good thing for Democrats.I totally called this bullshit\s\s> This is sort of proving my theory. \s\s> Years back (2010-2012) the popular sentiment on Reddit was that affirmative action was reverse racism that colorblind actions and policy are the way forward and that anything designed to help black people in particular was a handout or pandering. People hated the idea that anyone especially minorities would get special treatment over them. The affirmative action college admissions debate was hugely contentious. \s\s> My theory is that none of this sentiment changed. These are probably some of the same people even. Go waltz into the chapo or bernout sub and ask them how they feel about affirmative action. Guarantee they give you some roundabout explanation that they aren't against it per se but it doesn't work and we should get rid of it (for free college duh)\s\s> They cling to these ""egalitarian"" colorblind policies so they can pretend to support minority issues while turning it into something for themselves.Jesus Christ this is an actual recent quote.

This won’t really win you a lot of support outside of people who already are looking for any item to nitpick about him. It’s 2019 and I think many people are beginning to become cognizant of the ways in which Rouen candidates are paraded in front of people because they meet checkboxes. I don’t care if the nominee looks like me or my people I care more about their policies.\s\sI don’t think this is a radical claim by Sanders.\s\sEdit: I have been banned but please message me if you want to discuss this with a non-white personHow to write in Bernie after he loses the primary again:\s\sOpen your ballot\s\sWrite “BERNIE SANDERS!” across the whole thing in big letters\s\sFrame it on your wall so everyone can see how principled you are\s\sAlternatively fill in the circle marked “Donald Trump”.

Expect him to file tons of nuisance lawsuits claiming ""rigging"" because he doesn't understand how anything works.Lolllllllllllllllllllllllplz nolmaooooooooooooooWhen do we start the betting pool on what share of the vote he gets? I'm thinking 5%Eh she always gets someone running against her and they tend to get in the 16-19% range. So I could see him breaking 20% but I'm sure the margin will be laughable. This is why they lose because it is *always* a vendetta with these motherfuckers. The voters don't want that shit.They are more interested in getting rid of the centrists than they are in opposing right-wing extremists. I think it's the same thing in the UK with Corbyn and his far left fringe group. The far left is always more interested in taking over a centre-left political party than in winning elections. Why? Because they think they have won a symbolic victory on what kind of left the country deserves to have. Never mind if they never get to govern they can still praise themselves for socialist purity. >Sanders sent an email to his supporters asking for ideas regarding how to implement a Medicare for All plan\s\sLazy socialist is lazy.The attack ads just write themselves don't they.\s\sShow an unkempt 35-year old stoner in a poorly-lit room.

I thought he was supposedly too good and pure for that.just lol. [deleted]Seems like Vermonters like him as well though. He's only a few percentage points behind Sanders despite having much less name recognition. Ughhh why do we keep rewarding incompetence?Can we cede Vermont (or at least Burlington) to Quebec? Bernie would fit in great there. I call this out all the time but it's super easy to be popular when you're from a small homogeneous rural state. Look at the top 9 out of 10 senators. You don't need to do shit and you're guaranteed re-election.\s\sOther thing I'll point out is that Hillary had a mid 70's approval rate when she left NY. There's more people in 1/5th of Brooklyn than there are in all of Vermont and she was able to be successful there. Meanwhile Bernie lost the district he was born in by a 2:1 margin.It's among their consituents right? No big surprises here this greatly rewards senators in solid blue states like Hawaii and Vermont. And Vermont loves Bernie just check out how many votes he got in the 2016 general there.It is based on their constituents but Bernie supporters were never good at understanding context and I doubt that they will be better this time. Expect a lot of ""HE'S THE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN AMERICA!""On the plus side Donnelly Manchin and Heitkamp aren't looking too bad and Flake and Heller are pretty low.

It's not surprising that low population states bubble to the top on this poll they have the least data for them.Low pop + solid blue/redNotice #2 #3 and #4 are Senators with absolutely no national profile and probably only 1 in 50000 voters would recognize. That confirms that the people at the top of this list are the least well-known not the most popular.> 1 in 50000 voters would recognize (the senators from hawaii)   \s\syou're giving americans way too much credit  \s\s...and Mitch McConnell is the least popular Senator and was able to steal a Supreme Court seat and is dangerously close to taking away health care for millions.

These people are nuts what next owning your clothes isn't a right or the food on your table. And they think this shit plays well anywhere but their entitled brains.Lmao hiring low skill minimum wage workers definitely isn’t a right either it’s a privilege that will quickly go away in many areas in the country with this dumbass bill especially with automation.[deleted]He started that a year ago with Medicare for All and a large number of presumptive 2020 candidates took the bait. Just as ACA is becoming popular he wants to pull everything left till Democrats are advocating completely overhauling healthcare for the second time in 10 years.\s\s ""Remember when we said ACA was going to be a huge improvement and we spent 8 years promoting it? Yeah it was shit so now we need to put everyone on Medicare""How much credibility does that inspire? GOP is going to have a field day. We couldn't pass a public option with one party control of government how in the world would that pass? \s\s\s\sEven lots of people who support single payer recognize tht Medicare is not a responsible way to go. It's far more generous than most single payer programs and most importantly it isn't discretionary spending. It's on budgetary autopilot and is the single fastest growing item on the balance sheet even with the current age restrictions. There is a responsible discussion to be had about Medicaid expansion so that people under 65 have a basic health insurance and can purchase coverage over and above through their employers as they so choose. Medicaid is part of the regular budget we can discuss spending increases and decreases each year. With Medicare Congress has to act to control costs and even when they propose a smaller increase in spending from the previous year AARP hits the airwaves calling it cuts to Medicare and they win the messaging argument every single time. \s\s\sThese plans are going to require a huge broadening of our very narrow tax base (top quintile pays 87% of federal income tax the remainimg 13% comes mostly from the second quntile and nearly half get all their taxes back every April) so a lot of people who weren't paying much in income taxes suddenly will be. Whether that is ""what's in their best interest"" or not it is going to be the subject of a lot of backlash. This would have been the case in 2010 but now with the newest round of tax cuts the relative tax increases will need to be that much larger.\s\sDemocrats need to resist letting Bernie put all these albatrosses around their necks or they will lose in 2020. I went on an equally long rant about what $15 would mean in poorer states so I'm not going to repeat it all again here. The Senate map is really favorable to Democrats in 2020 it would be a shame to throw away the white house over $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All when you could run on fixing ACA infrastructure and restoring our relations with the rest of the world. ~~Like Trump can't let the attention drift away from him.~~\s\sEdit: on second thought if the Dems play this right they can get Trump to veto raising min wage by $1 or something like that. (Senate will never pass a ""raise min wage to $15 tomorrow bill. But it's not impossible that they raise it a little bit.) Left wing labor activists dream of ""optics"" like that. (Of course this is assuming Trump doesn't get slick like Chris Christie and claim he's vetoing it because it doesn't go far enough.)I like your edit. Especially since we have the House now. Bernard needs to take a seat. Pelosi got this. [deleted]Sure hes got legislation! It reads: ""minimum wage should be $15 an hour.""> Does he have actual legislation written up or is it another one of his vague ideas he drafted up?\s\sIt's actually one of his longer bills but all it says is *the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to read not less than $x an hour after y years* repeating until $15 and repeating again for tipped / disabled workers.\s\sBernie is basically incapable of writing serious broad-picture legislation. None of his bills that I've seen ever gave any thought to any repercussions or side effects or indeed any result at all. He simply assumes it will usher in paradise on earth with zero downsides.\s\sEven his new and improved Single Payer bill is just a massive wish list that didn't get around to how he's going to pay for any of it (the old one he keep introducing for a decade just said ""someone else should figure out how to implement Bernie's great idea"").I bet any of the comments in reply that are agreeing or saying ""owning a business isn't a right it's a privilege"" and all that bullshit haven't step foot into a basic macro class.\s\sEDIT: Fixed spelling I apparently forgot to pay attention in my English classes.$15x40hrsx52weeks is $31200. Higher than the average per capita income in all but 12 states. This would be a catastrophe for a huge portion of the country. If I'm a small business owner in Kentucky I'm looking for any possible way to cut staff so I can minimize how much I have to raise prices for my customers and keep what business i can. It doesn't take that many people making this calculation to reach high levels of unemployment which in turn hurt the economy even more. This is a bill written by a man who has never considered much of anything with regards to economics. People are going to reconsider discretionary spending if you double minimum wage. ""Do I really need to get that fence this year?"" ""Maybe I'll  do my own landscaping."" ""I'll get cheaper groceries and less produce to save money etc."" You have to handle this stuff at the state and municipal level. The federal minimum wage should be the minimum wage necessary to get by in the lowest cost locality and state and municipal ordinances should raise the bar as befits their own cost of living. $15 an hour in a lot of places is enough to big a single income earner paying for a modest home. Nobody expects you to be able to do that bagging groceries which of course is why everyone will be bagging their own Ugh.  This is what's wrong with our ""business as usual"" government and esp those grandstanding showboaters who get nothing done...\s\sBernie KNOWS it won't get past Mitch McConnell...  But this is going to be some media-sucking Democratic purity test.\s\sAnd besides - more than DOUBLE?  Really?  What do you think small business owners in Arkansas and West Virginia going to think?[deleted]Min wages work just fine done correctly.  You are describing them done incorrectly.  A $30 min wage is indeed to high and would cause the effects you describe.  Plenty of studies done in places that implemented a modest increase saw no job loss and less people on the welfare rolls.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sNow what is incorrect is taking a wage appropriate for an affluent state like Vermont and applying it to the entire country. Still waiting on how this will benefit rural areas with low cost of living...>If you wanted to end starvation wages you’d be aiming higher than $15. It’s disgusting we have to spend years fighting for another plate of scraps.\s\slol how much do these adult-aged children think they deserve for living with their parents when they're 30 and being unproductive?STOP TRYING TO DISMANTLE MY PARTYThe best part about it? Check out the clown leading this show.It's almost as if these morons don't understand there are more important things and fights going on right now. \s\sThey are in essence trying to ensure that Trump wins a second term. Their BS helped elect Trump and their response to that is to double down. Even a few on S4P recognize that Cenk is divisive and shouldn't be a part of it.So no monies from George Soros Bill Gates Warren Buffet Micheal Bloomberg Mark Cuban or Elon Musk then?  There ARE leftist millionaire and billionares.  They arent inherently evil.And so the Tea Party of the Left beginsSMH. This is so obviously the LAST thing we need now. We need to cultivate candidates to contest Republican seats and unite behind incumbent Democrats if we are ever to wrest control of Congress from the GOP. We don't need to be eating our own. Cenk & company can go off with Bernie & company and start their own party. Leave the Democrats alone. You aren't one of us.I recall reading the name 'just us' democrats used to refer to these guys and man I've never heard a more apt name.""Progressives""Seriously ""Justice Democrats?"" That's the best you could come up with? ""Purity Party"" or ""Green Tea Party"" are more fitting...Useful idiotsI had been pretty hopeful when she said this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/8v5ny5/ocasiocortez_is_more_practical_than_the_average/ but I'm less so if this is the fight she is preparing to have with Duckworth of all people.Wait a minute that’s basically the same point Duckworth made lol! What the hell is her campaign manager on right now?Duckworth made the same point by subtly attacking her. When Ocasio-Cortez was saying what needed to be said there was absolutely no need for Duckworth to chime in. Oh fuck.  Is she really doing this?  I knew this would happen. Buckle up. What a dumbass.\s\sSaying Bernie would fare better in Nebraska (or Kansas or Indiana) against a Republican because he got more votes there in the primary is equivalent to saying that Hillary would fare better than Bernie in Tennessee against a Republican because she got more votes there in the primary: it makes zero difference whether the nominee is Hillary or Bernie in deep red states unless the Republican opponent has child sexual assault allegations.Even then it's uncomfortably close.Also Bernie won the Nebraska *caucus* and lost the primary (that didn’t count). Way more people voted in the primary than the caucus. Bernie winning over a few thousand Democratic activists by no means suggests the person can carry the state in a general election. Hillary won Alabama Mississippi Ohio and Florida (just to name a few) in the primaries but lost them in the general. What's her point?As soon as she mentioned not having “big corporate donors” or whatever in her Facebook ad I knew she was on the Bro train. Beto doesn't take corporate donations either and AFAIK he isn't a Bernie bro.She's a Bern out.  Yes she is.""Reform"" Bernouts face a daily struggle against their Bernout tendencies.Oh jesus. Donald Trump won NY CA HI IL WA OR and VE during the 2016 Republican primaries and that meant dick in the general election. She needs to focus on winning in the general for her fucking election because right now she is not picking up many Democratic votes with rhetoric like this. I knocked on doors in her district in 2016 and I can tell you the real Democratic voters of her district are not gonna like hearing shit like this. I don’t think that there are many real democrats who would let the GOP hold on to the house to send a message to the least moderate parts of the party. Generous appraisal of this tired take: Half correct half stupid entirely irrelevant. I've told you before that she's bad in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/8u8gu8/as_a_new_yorker_and_lifelong_democrat_alexandria/e1deinf/?context=0) that was heavily brigaded by Chapos. \s\sNotice how half of the states she mentioned were caucuses and one of them (Nebraska) also had a primary with a bigger turnout that Hillary won. Notice how she tried to push Minnesota as a state we lost even though we didn't notice how she doesn't say anything about midwest states that HRC won like Ohio or Missouri or Illinois you know the exact midwest state that fucking elected Duckworth in the first fucking place in 2016? Again what type of mindset do you gotta have to twist the facts in such a way? \s\sBut what else to expect from a lady who [praises Tulsi Gabbard](https://twitter.com/Ocasio2018/status/1012403662692417537) and talks about [the economic anxiety of Trump voters from Bronx](https://twitter.com/Ocasio2018/status/981180080419475457). \s\sLooking forward to tweets from her about how Assad did nothing wrong and people voted for Trump in the midwest because the liberal elites from Bronx and Queens forced them to do it. \s\sI think it's down to some of us -- and I don't entirely exclude myself -- being eager to rationalize her win and seizing on some superficially conciliatory gestures of hers. OC's near-infinite spam-to-accomplishments ratio is giving Bernie a run for his money.Bernie lost CA therefore it would have been in play during the general. That's how this ""logic"" works right?Also  that's a very cursed comment section. yeesh.You are being insincere. Bernie won all of those states if you count the superdelegates in the electoral college. Bernie won 1865 Trump won only 1725  delegates. Boom checkmate! /sAll but two are red states so why do they matter if Trump was going to win them anyway?\s\s/Bernie Bro logicMinnesota Kansas and Nebraska were caucus states. The primary in Nebraska yielded a Hillary win. So that puts a hole in her argument. Indiana would not have gone Bernie and Michigan was so narrow that Bernie may have lost there as well. Trump and Cruz got more votes than Bernie in Wisconsin IIRC.\s\sThey also conveniently leave out Virginia Nevada and New Mexico. Or Florida Ohio and North Carolina. Hell even Delaware and New Jersey were blowouts in the primary and somewhat competitive in the general what would have happened there?>Hell even Delaware and New Jersey were blowouts in the primary and somewhat competitive in the general what would have happened there?\s\sThey would have still voted strongly Dem? I don't know why you would suggest that these states were competitive in the general because they weren't and they never would have been regardless of the candidate. 54-41&#37; is not competitive. That is a very typical outcome for New Jersey. There's plenty of redneck country around here but the metro areas and I95 corridor are very liberal and densely populated and they come out in the greatest numbers during presidential elections.Fuck.\s\sThis.\s\sAsshole.Duckworth picked a fight with her first. I don’t like the response but the fact is she wouldn’t have said anything if it wasn’t for Duckworth’s attack. Keep quiet and support each other. When we have a Democratic Congress and President fight as much as you want. \s\sReally disappointed that some members of the Party are feeding into the GOP’s desire for them to attack Ocasio-Cortez and reignite internal party feuding. We were supporting her until she started with her attacks on the party and Bernie would have won bullshit. It’s always gaslighting with the Bernouts. They start attacking us and we’re expected to be quiet and go away. Except for when it comes to funding and volunteering for the actual Party they are using  to run their Dem hating candidates. Oh and voting of course. I would hardly say it's a fight.[deleted]""Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner the publisher of Observer Media.""\s\s(mirthless laughter.gif)Ah yes Jared Kushner the guy who *literally* made the New York Observer white.

Rx opiate manufacturers are also facing multiple civil suits from a couple different states. \s\sImo damage is done. Civil suits are appropriate to try and get these companies to pay for the damage they caused but the focus has to be now on how to deal with and pay for the existing problem. \s\sBut Sanders is a showman & a ""make a statement"" type rather than an ""actually get something done"" type.\s\sAlso we love to hate CEOs and lord knows they're responsible for some terrible things in this case but it was a systemic failure from pharma companies to doctors to local pharmacies to individual patients and you can't jail the whole system.So he doesn't understand ""No ex poste facto."" Color me shocked.What a fucking idiot.The marketing aspect is ineffective.  All of the major opioids in use have been generic for years.  It'd be like marketing brand Zoloft in 2018 total waste.  There's very little if any direct to consumer marketing for opioids right now and that's all this bill focuses on with regards to marketing.  Totally missed the marketing that targets the prescriber and that's a huge issue.\s\sWhat happened way back when with Perdue/Oxycontin ER is the majority of the marketing campaign was targeting prescribers.  Those drug reps were selling hard that high dose extended release opioids were safe for indications beyond cancer pain.      That's how these drugs became so popular not direct to consumer marketing.\s\sAlso have to ask what does he think this will prevent?  The odds of another opioid blockbuster drug in the future is slim to none.  The newer ones have been flops.  Future is prob going to be buprenorphine or ketamine analogues or cannaniboids not opioids. \s\sOn top of all of this the bill doesn't ban direct to consumer marketing for opioids it bans ""inaccurate"" marketing.  And inaccurate only applies to the addictive properties.  So if a company decides ""fuck it let's do direct to consumer!"" you'll get plenty of up beat music with people smiling doing daily chores in well lit spaces pain free.  In reality you're taking your pain from a 9 to a 5 still in pain still limping but functional.He wants to lock up billionaires while pandering to the white opioid addict voting bloc in Trump states.https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-opioid-crisis-accountability-act-of-2018?inline=file\s\sBraved his site to pull up the bill to review it.\s\sAs I already covered the marketing stuff is hilarious ineffective and stupid.  You can still market but you must be honest!  Yeah there's already laws about that that's why Purdue and their executives pleaded guilty over ten years ago.  \s\sThe one part that I actually think has promise is the distribution part but it's an afterthought and not fleshed out at all.\s\s>(B) supplying States or communities with a quantity of opioids that is not medically reasonable as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Attorney General using if applicable data from the Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System of the Department of Justice; or\s\s>(C) failing to report to the Secretary any order or pattern of orders for the distribution of opioids that would cause a reasonable person to believe the opioids were  not being dispensed in a medically reasonable manner.   \s\sThe way it works on the front line with respect to pharmacies and pharmacists is that it's their job to identify when something is wrong investigate and report.  Failure to do so can result in loss of licensing and for the pharmacy itself loss of it's DEA license.  I think in theory that should be the same standard for distributors but what the fuck is this plan.  ""Medically reasonable"" is vague as fuck and he pushes that definition off to the side for someone else to figure out.  When working in a pharmacy you know the store and the patients you can tell when shit is unusual.  When you're a distributor sending off meds to tens of thousands of pharmacies across the country tracking and picking up unusual patterns is really fucking hard.  Also relying on self reporting is just stupid and no mention of audits to check in to make sure shit is actually getting reported.  \s\sIf it was easy to track and identify these abnormalities the DEA would already be doing it via 222 forms that you must submit everytime controlled substances transfer from manufacturer to distributor to pharmacy.   In a magical perfect world dump a fuck ton of funding into the DEA get a massive team to monitor track and analyze all 222 forms and then have them investigate if needed.\s\sAnd the rest of this bill is him masturbating at the thought of punishing the drug companies and detailing those punishments.  He probably busted a nut when he wrote the $7.8 billion part.\s\sOh and this law will be retroactive back to January 1 1985.  Once passed the government will start investigating all opioid manufacturers going back to that date and charging them with crimes that didn't become crimes until decades later.  Yeah pretty certain that's not legal.  And shit if we have resources to do that let's track present day 222 forms.Oh also how the fuck is a manufacturer supposed to figure out if what they're shipping out to the distributors is ""medically necessary""?  All they know is the distribution center it's going to that's it.  They don't know what community it's going to it could get transferred to another distribution center on the other side of the country.Both ideas are completely ridiculous. You can't hold manufacturers responsible for misuse of their products. If we could the first place to start would be automakers who have spent millions of dollars lobbying and refuse to put ignition interlock devices as standard equipment on new cars despite the fact that they are cheap and have been for 20 years. We realize we can't do that because they would be paying damages 10k times per year. It would be a backdoor way to make something illegal without actually using the democratic process to explicitly ban it. That's the political equivalent of tilting the vending machine.people couldn't misuse their stuff if they didn't make it.\s\sAlthough there is an argument that people aren't misusing guns at all. One that I would agree with.Kids on Reddit talk like you can still walk into a paid Dr with a little owie and walk out with 360 OC80s 30 8mg dilaudid & 60 2mg xanax. The pill mill phenomenon is over. Your dentist prescribing three five mg Percocets after an extraction is not indicative of ""doctors out of control"". Not saying it wasn't awful because it was but I do think some people are losing perspective. Cannabis isn't going to get you through the first week after a hip replacement or invasive thoracic surgery. I mean it *is* ridiculous to hold manufacturers being responsible for crimes committed with their products.Unless they're in Pharma apparently.Even if this got passed it wouldn't accomplish anything. The cat is already out of the bag on opioids and you can't punish execs because of ex post facto anyway.\s\sIt would be *way* more productive to work on a bill to curb unnecessary prescription of opioids fund treatment or attempts to combat the epidemic or literally anything other than to go after the execs. It'll do nothing to actually address the current crisis. All this does is give Bernouts something new to froth over and bots something new to circulate online.Punishing people for criminal misuse of a product is a bit different than punishing people for lying about the safety of their product. If guns were killing people by mistake and the gun companies were covering it up the situations would be equivalent. As is almost all gun deaths are intentional and the gun execs admit it. > If guns were killing people by mistake and the gun companies were covering it up the situations would be equivalent.\s\sWhat about if gun manufacturers were dumping guns into saturated markets where their sale is legal knowing that they'd be smuggled into states and cities where their sale was illegal?\s\s[Because that's what happens and it was the discovery of this and the resulting push from states to hold manufacturers responsible that prompted the passage of the PLCAA which Sanders supported.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/bernie-sanders-vote-gun-immunity-black-market/)This is the best tl;dr I could make [original](https://www.statnews.com/2018/04/17/bernie-sanders-bill-jail-opioid-crisis/) reduced by 71%.

(but below Rolex)\s\sBernie doesn't even single out pharmaceutical companies or banks rather refers to their industries.  But Amazon?\s\sHow about talking about how high Bank of America bank fees are?  Is there something that the Federal government could do?  YOU BET.\s\sBUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I'm thinking  **as Sanders seems to be developing an online media presence** more attention will be paid to him:\s\shttp://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/bernie-sanders-is-quietly-building-a-digital-media-empire.html\s\sAnd for once he'll have to start sticking his neck out.  \s\sI honestly wish him luck but I think he's going to need it because actually proposing laws that would work would be something he doesn't have a lot of experience in...Remember these are the folks who disparaged Clinton's detailed (dare I say nuanced) response to the fracking issue and lauded BS's simplistic knee-jerk ""No"".[deleted]It's only been a few days since Obama's farewell speech and progressives have already discarded his words. Of course it makes sense for Booker to protect pharmaceuticals if they make up the industry in his state he would be a terrible representative of NJ if he didn't look out for his state otherwise (and if he hurt it in the wrong way he might not get re-elected which means he won't have any influence in Congress). Now you can have a discussion if national politics should override state politics and if that's right or not but you know that takes reasoning and argument. Not self-righteous denunciation through labels (wait...this seems like identity politics doesn't it?)Reminds me of when Sanders voted in favor of the F-35 fighter jet because it was going to be made in Vermont.> progressives have already discarded his words\s\sProgressives has hated Obama since 2010 for not delivering universal healthcare and ""compromising too much"". They stayed home and stewed in their bitterness for the next six years to watch their number one enemy Establishment Democrats get decimated one very level.\s\s>The kind of amendment put forward by Sanders-Klobuchar was mostly symbolic- it would have not actually legalized prescription drug importation from Canada. \s\sIs that true?Yep. The votes that night were just about goals the senates budget would have wanted to fulfil. All except the massive level of disrespect in not only listing Sanders's name but listing it *before* the woman that actually wrote and put forth the amendment. Keep your post modernist shit out all that matters is the view of our lord and savior Bernie Christ!> nuance\s\swho has time for that we need more nothingburgers to froth at the mouth at while republicans destroy the countryBut even then only if it's something that can be summed up in meme form.It's pretty spectacular. One guy on my Facebook feed literally went from ""I want to kiss this man."" to ""you betrayed me Cory!"" in the span of a day. Then went on to praise Joe Biden the day after. Like... WHAT?!There are certain things men must do to remain men.Especially considering that Biden was one of the most pro-business Senators in the country for years.>nuance\s\sThe thing that died in 2015-2016 thanks to Trumpets and Berners?And why are all Bernie's foot soldiers ignoring Booker's vote for the Wyden Amendment that would have done the same thing (lower prices by importing drugs from Canada) but included the safety certification provision that the Klobachur Amendment did not?Because their leader ignored it by railing against the Dems who voted for his preferred amendment.  He knows his base.  He knows if he diverts their attention away from real progress they'll believe the Dems are anti-progress.  They won't research any points he makes. Remember Bernie's the only 'authentic' politician in the world.  He said it was because of safety concerns. That's bs. It was bs when Republicans said it.\s\sHowever NJ IS home to a gigantic pharmaceutical industry and hence he has many constituents who work for the industry.\s\sThe issue is also trickier than acknowledged. Currently we subsidize the international pharmaceutical R&D. Other countries have to step up to the plate so that we don't shoulder the burden alone.\s\sYou can't solve this problem with a simple rider.So you're saying that protectionism is bad when it's someone who's not Bernie Sanders advocating it?  It's actually a bad year to be voting against populism and protectionism.  He was kind of damned if he did damned if he didn't.\s\sThe amendment was very specific and quite silly.  It was meant to be a message not a plan.It was poorly worded though because it said ""Canada and other countries"". Regulations in say India or China might be a lot less closer to ours than Canada's.> Currently we subsidize the international pharmaceutical R&D.\s\s(Recognizing that you are in fact a mod not a troll.)  Can you give me more info on this?This is actually what the Klobachur amendment sought to do:\s\s\s>**Purpose: S.Amdt. 178 — 115th Congress (2017-2018)**\s\s>To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to lower prescription drug prices for Americans by importing drugs from Canada.\s\sI bet not one of the Bernie Minions losing their minds and calling for Booker's head can tell you what the hell that part about a ""deficit neutral reserve fund"" even means because that is a whole lot more complicated than just allowing Canadian drugs into the country.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks to reporters in the Capitol July 18. PHOTO: J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE/ASSOCIATED PRESS\s\sWhen people say that Democrats should unify the part they leave out is most important: Around what? Nearly everyone in Washington seems to assume that progressives should shut up accept their place and unify around the status quo.\s\sThink about what an arrogant and preposterous request that is. Progressive leaders including our representatives in Congress should abandon all of our policy positions and sell out our voters to please the Democratic establishment. Saying “hell no” to that would be an enormous understatement.\sIf Democratic leaders don’t want to fight Donald Trump that’s their problem not ours. We signed up to rout him and send him home. If you’re not on board with that get out of the way and let us do it. Democratic voters were clear in 2018 that they want Mr. Trump impeached. Yet again last week Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies blocked an opportunity by tabling Rep. Al Green’s resolution.\s\sUnlike Mr. Green I don’t think we need to discuss President Trump’s political or racial ideology to favor impeachment. The president has clearly committed two crimes. Robert Mueller’s report outlines double-digit instances of obstruction of justice. That’s a felony. Michael Cohen confirmed that Mr. Trump worked with him to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels in violation of campaign-finance laws—a crime for which Mr. Cohen is in prison.\sThat’s apparently still not enough for Mrs. Pelosi. There is not a single public official doing more to protect Mr. Trump than she is. Even Attorney General William Barr couldn’t stop an impeachment inquiry if he tried. The only person who has the power to seek justice against Mr. Trump steadfastly refuses to pursue him. The only thing Mrs. Pelosi appears to be resisting is holding Mr. Trump accountable.\s\sDemocratic powder to fight Republicans is forever dry. Detention centers without any constraints? Check. Defeating an amendment to prohibit the Pentagon from housing kids at the military facilities? Check. Continuing to let Mr. Trump run roughshod through a House the Democrats control is an abdication of responsibility. Democrats have been surrendering to the GOP for as long as I have been alive. That is part of the reason we formed the Justice Democrats—because we’re sick of the nonstop capitulation. It’s time for strong Democrats. Justice is coming.\sThen Mrs. Pelosi makes the absurd point that we don’t want to waste our time fighting or impeaching Trump because that would take time away from policy. What policy? She calls the Green New Deal the “green dream or whatever.” She says she has 30-year-old “signs about single payer” in her basement but insists we aren’t ready for it.\s\sProgressives have been asking for a vote on the minimum wage for six months. Mrs. Pelosi said she’d hold one within the first 100 hours. When she didn’t the rationale was that some conservative Democrats objected. So what? Let them vote no and it’ll pass easily anyway. We were right. After enormous pressure by progressives finally the House voted Thursday. Only six Democrats opposed it.\sSo Mrs. Pelosi allowed six corporate Democrats to hold up that legislation for six months—but God forbid a progressive Democrat ever objects to leadership. Then we’ll have a national controversy over how insolent young progressive women are.\sThe overwhelming majority of Democratic voters want to fight Mr. Trump and pass progressive priorities. If the Democrats unify around anything it should be around their voters who clearly prefer the positions of Justice Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. If the pundits really believe in unity—as opposed to submission to the establishment—they will support the logical conclusion that the Democratic Party should unify around AOC not Mrs. Pelosi.\sMr. Uygur is creator and a co-host of “The Young Turks” and a co-founder of the Justice Democrats.\s\s0:00 / 0:00\s\s￼\s\s￼\s\s￼\s\sOpinion: The Impeachment Phonies\s\sDemocrats defeat a resolution to impeach Donald Trump despite claiming he's unfit for office.

Their salaries don't come out of thin air. They get healthcare as well for their service. The military budget isn't just for making jets and shit.They know they just don't care.  It's the same way with the medical industry and all of the people who would lose their jobs berners are completely unsympathetic.  Military members also have their education paid for.

Politics are about power and it's quite possible to acquire that outside institutions of the state.\s\sIOW your chapter is probably right.  :-PThere's something a little off about the messaging of this but it's hard to describe. I have 15 employees. To them I'm their boss. Most of them are liberal (young science education so it follows) and we will talk politics from time to time. I have four levels of management above me and all are fantastic people who will do anything for their employees. The higher up the management ladder you go at my location the more hours you work and the more you work for the people below you.\s\sThe issue isn't at our building which employs almost 5% of the company and has a few thousand workers. Our ""boss"" who doesn't care is at the corporate level. For instance they made a big announcement that the company would save $180 million this year for the tax cuts and then announced that up to 40000 people would be eligible for up to a $500 one time bonus. Doing some math that's only about 9% max of one year's savings and then we will never see another dime of those savings. Meanwhile the CEO's pay has topped $10 million for the last 4 years.\s\sSo I guess my issue is when words like ""boss"" are used it muddies the issue. My bosses are fantastic. The corporate structure above us is so rotten it's hard to imagine how people can ignore it. I think it would do us all great benefit to frame the debate not on the management at company X but the board and executives who actually chart the direction of the company. The most insidious game here is stock buybacks. That $180 million mentioned earlier? More than half of it is earmarked for stock buybacks and since the executives are compensated almost entirely in stock they double dip on these tax cuts. \s\sBasically I think we're using 20th century terminology to address a 21st century fight.[deleted]This.\sDistract the masses while you pick their pockets.A brave new world As a landlord why would I vote to keep your pay  low?

This sounds like a nice workaround but seriously people should just be paid enough to afford food.  Applied for food stamps while in college and I don’t qualify because I don’t work 20 hours a week on top of full time school. Just seems so backwards to meThank you Bernie!Good luck my dudes! Of course it would be better if minimum wages reflected the cost of living but whatever steps need to be taken should be taken.Hopefully with this law + a $15 minimum wage then wages across the board would change over the course of a few years to become LIVING wages.Seriously. The minimum wage should be tied to the cost of living in the most expensive city within some number of dozen miles.I believe that part of the intention of this--the Amazon Wal-Mart etc. one--is to convince those within or in support of the corporations that it is actually in their benefit to pay their employees decent living wages and to provide them with adequate benefits.\s\sAm I talking about convincing every member of the Walton family? Nah. (If it changes their minds though cool!) I am speaking about those who shop there and have been brainwashed into thinking that the companies are good and the poor are bad.\s\sAlso I bet Bernie would love to debate his support for this bill with both Democrats and Trump. Many will stand against it because they want to help their rich donors but he knows that if he has clear examples of this people will support him.\s\sEvery time I think Bernie could not get any better he surprises me! So...I'm a single dude with no kids and I've only pulled need-based assistance for a few months in my lifetime (thankfully)...so this legislation might not directly benefit me but I'm totally on-board with taking care of kids no matter what.  I pay taxes to send kids to school and to make sure they have food and homes (I'm solidly in the bottom bracket).  \s  \sThis kind of thing seems like it is rife for abuse in leading to wink-and-nod employment discrimination against people who are likely to need assistance.  It would make the employment costs of someone with a kid that needs help considerably higher than hiring me.  It would not be too hard for a savvy employer to ask qualifying questions just on the right side of legal but with unprovably illegal intent.  Sounds like a really good reason to get rid of public assistance...You know that will happen.__Hello and welcome to r/DemSocialists!__ \s\sIf you're a DSA Member make sure to fill out the [userflair request](https://goo.gl/forms/bbacmhd19epywpOr1) form to rid yourself of that filthy _Not DSA_ flair. \s\s## You look _way_ better in red!\s\s* __Join us on [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/4b4Cw7d)\s* Don't forget to read our [Rules](/r/demsocialists/about/rules) to get a good idea of what's expected of participants in our community.\s* Make sure to also read our [Privacy Policy](/r/demsocialists/wiki/privacy_policy) so you can learn where we stand on the topic of your safety and why we need verifications.\s \s### ---> __REMINDER!__ Don't forget to [Renew Your Dues](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/) in 2019! \s \s----\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

0,Political_Revolution,MedicareForAll,15,"Bless Jimmy Carter.  The last President that wasn't bought and owned by large corporations the banks and Wall Street.   The last President and nearly the only President to never be at war in this Country.   A man of intelligence and integrity. What did the ""Media"" do to his reputation?  Cut him down and belittle him for the last 35+ year.   I guess that tells you who we should never be listening to.How about Republican voters.  I would imagine they have to feel the same.  I mean GOP do get ill too right?  Or is illness a leftest conspiracy theory.I agree.  There is no solution trying to maintain the current private insurance system especially tied to employment.  We would have so much more freedom if healthcare was a public good like schools roads police/fire dept. etc.  Yes we have to pay for it with taxes just like those public goods.  It will cost less than what we currently pay for insurance premiums deductibles copays medicare deduction and no one will go bankrupt for medical problems.  Spread the word!\s\sI wish we could have an honest discussion of why politicians aren't behind this even though most people want it and how to get the lobbyists and dirty money out of our politics.\s\sHow much lower would car and home insurance be if the medical component was no longer needed?  That's another cost saver for we the people.  Some people could work less and no longer need to pay for daycare so that saves money and possibly builds stronger families.I love every idea you have here. I'm a supporter of healthcare for all mostly because of my parents are in those awkward years before Medicare/Medicaid but stuck paying high costs for low coverage because they own their own small business. Small businesses don't always make the profit margins some imagine. The one issue I have with arguing for Medicare for All is simply numbers. Everyone who contests it often want hard numbers of how much money it was actually save them. The California single payer idea a few weeks ago came up with the number of $400 billion just for their state. They said they would have to increase payroll tax and take money out of other places but stated that it was possible. Awesome. $400 billon was still tough to swallow for some non supporters. \s\sSo doing some quick numbers over the past few weeks this is what I came up with. On average i spend about 5-6% of my paycheck on healthcare. That's just insurance. I'm not going to the doctor that often. If I and my spouse have a child or two then that probably increases to 8-9%. Copays shots tests etc. If I or one of my children get diagnosed with a chronic disease well... I'm fuckin screwed. Or even a stay at a ICU or NICU could bankrupt us. I used to work on a cardiac telemetry floor. The price tag per night was in the thousands. That wasn't even one-on-one nursing care like an ICU. \s\sInstead of ideas we need to start putting this into monetary perspective for people. \sOne mistake. One car crash. One sick baby. One bill. It all can change your life forever. Unfortunately it may be too late for my father-in-law when something like that finally becomes available. He's currently in the county hospital with heart problems and he has no insurance. He was on the hospital's assistance program after he lost his job (let go after returning back to work from FMLA 3 months before he was going to retire) but now his disability kicked in and he makes $15 per month too much to qualify. So my wife is trying to find out what all his options are for getting coverage. They said he needs a Ventricular Assist Device or Heart Transplant but then said he needs insurance in order to do either. Yesterday they put an IV in his chest but then today told him due to lack of funding they can't give him the medication for it. So basically they are going to send him home to die unless he can get coverage for this. It pisses me off that there are procedures that could save him but they won't do them because he currently has no coverage. The poor guy keeps getting screwed. It is morally wrong that some hardworking citizens are priced out of the market while others are subsidized with tax exempt employer provided benefits. Yeah but I'm saying let's find a way to get jobs for those low skill people or truly discuss a universal basic income we need to be thinking further in the future rather than on issues that will sort themselves out once both parties get together and work on health care. I disagree it would put to heavy a burden on our tax paying citizens. Soon the lower education jobs will be taken over by robots so we need to figure that out before healthcare as that will be a much larger issue then healthcare. The tax paying citizens will be the ones employing said robots because it is cheaper instead of human labor. All the more reason we will need to make sure that those profiting chip in to keep the rest of the population healthy and able to go back to school and become robot maintenance technicians doctors nurses or whatever other skilled jobs are needed when everyone has healthcare. I hope they mean deductible or out of pocket maximum not copayAll this will do it increase monthly cost of insurance. He could limit it to $0. Just going to make insurance more expensiveHe's so disconnected from the reality of middle and lower class people.This dude is so out of touch. Sure a limit of $1000 is better than the current system but come on man! He's so stuck on wanting to keep the ACA but he refuses to acknowledge that Obama himself said the ACA was only a starting point.\s\sAlso the people who stay home from the doctor and keep their kids sick because of emergency room visit costs are not going to change because it's \*only\* $1000 to go.

Been listening to his ""Death of the Liberal Class"" all week.I’m a libertarian that leans more towards conservative. I don’t want to turn this into a debate but I can say in all honesty I agree with this. Where I fall short of fully supporting this is the thought of our government running it. There has to be some kind of oversight from outside sources because our government WILL screw it up. Maybe if it is single payer but the money is sent to private health insurance companies or something to that effect. Our government completely in control of healthcare will be a disaster just on the other end of the spectrum it is now. That’s not good for any of us either.I understand your concern but given the history our government has in partnering with private companies either the quality of service severely suffers or the private firm rips the government off to line their own pockets. The best answer would be the formulation of a single government agency that handles it all then contract with private citizens or some other organizations in some way to act as oversight monitoring for abuse poor customer service negligence and/or corruption."

I know we talk a big game (and Kyle Kulinski is probably the loudest with his show) and we've got numbers and a growing pot but is there anything resembling a plan on the horizon (something that we can do and put in action)? I pose this question to everyone subbed to r/justicedemocrats...This is a great exercise by Indivisible The Town hall Project and organizations like Together We Will along with others I am unaware of. For too long Dems have been sheep it's time to be wolves.It's extremely important we capitalize on the momentum and grow it. Not sure this perfect storm of shit will happen again in my lifetime. New new deal demsFORMER REPUBLICANS WELCOME HERE!Seems like current republicans are too by the looks of the movement...I live in Trump country.

Min wage healthcare for all building American infrastructure/transit helping the veterans! Maybe there'd be more momentum if the party were called the Justice Party. Middle class people on the left and right have a lot more in common economically than divides them by all this false outrage that's pumped through the media daily. ""Democrats"" is forever tainted.If what you're saying suggests that we go 3^rd party then I direct you to the ""institutional bias"" explanation of JD's original plan.   \s  \sThe reason JD's plan is to board the ""SS Democrat"" ship and assume command is because the problem isn't just the Democratic Party. The problem is overwhelmingly systemic: it's built on the preference of keeping it a two-party system.   \s  \sIt can only be Democrats vs Republicans on the main political stage and any other tertiary party affiliation (Green Libertarian Independent etc.) are ""not invited."" To keep it that way the rules are such that if 3^rd parties *DO* want in (debate-wise primary-wise etc.) they have to have a certain number of support in the polls (like 15% in the general election to debate).   \s  \sOf course this doesn't even cover the battleground that is the media coverage for 3^rd parties. Mainstream media (MSM) itself is also an uphill battle what with the disproportionate coverage that they give to candidates. Sure they'll give an interview here and there but they're small crumbs compared to that given to a Dem or Rep candidate and the framing of the interview is so slanted against them that hardly any real comprehensive message from the candidate can really be given unfortunately...much less there's not a lot of time to give it. The less time you have on the airwaves the less of an impact you'll have.  \s  \sBy branding and running as Democrats there's a much better chance of getting the fair media coverage and exposure that's necessary to convey the message of JD's platform. The MSM will *HAVE* to listen to the Democratic Party if Justice Democrats *ARE* the Democratic Party.Oregon 2020 Election \s\s[Register to Vote](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/vr/register.do?lang=eng&source=SOS) \s\s[Primary Election](http://sos.oregon.gov/voting/Pages/drop-box-locator.aspx): May 19 2020 \s\s[General Election](http://sos.oregon.gov/voting/Pages/drop-box-locator.aspx): November 3 2020Does it take a Trump to get a Bernie?

I want a progressive movement not just a Bernie movement. He can’t be our only golden child because he’s going to retire eventually and then most of you will bemoan any other candidate for not being just like Bernie and become apathetic voters again. \s\sI personally don’t want Bernie to run again so we can have different faces of progressivism. That doesn’t mean I want him to disappear; I still expect him to be rallying beside the true progressives and give direction to the movement. Who else can garner a movement with as much as support? Bernie already has this following.\s\s\sBernie’s success at the highest level of office can spur more progressives.\s\s\sWe need to “cash in” on him while we can essentially.I think that is what the JDs are really all about.  I don't think we can get anyone else the required name recognition to get through the primary though.  Beating the establishment Dems is going to be the biggest hurdle and by accident to events Bernie may be the only progressive that can do it.  He certainly isn't the only one qualified or the only one who could win the general.\s\sI would love for him to run with a VP with whom he could share the spotlight.  Not another shadowy VP like we have gotten used to but one that can engage in what has become a non-stop campaign season leaving the president to govern.As much as I love Bernie I really think it is a mistake to back him at this point.  Last year was the last viable year for him I think.  We need someone a lot younger and not that it's the critical defining factor but a woman or another non-white person would be nice too.  Lots of potential candidates come to mind that fit the criteria and are equally progressive as Bernie.  I am personally gonna wait to see how the field plays out before I make my final decision on who to back.  It is still very early in the game to be making any major predictions like this I think.Biden is only one year younger and no one is saying he shouldn't run. > Lots of potential candidates come to mind that fit the criteria and are equally progressive as Bernie.\s\sLike who? Bernie's rise to prominence was pretty historic and to expect it to happen again is asking a lot. It also seems kind of odd for a movement to basically be riding on the back of his candidacy then turning around and saying 'ok thanks and all but now you're too old.'Omg he's the most popular politician in the country with a lifetime of true public service yeah let's judge him for irrelevant reasons so we can go back to identity politics.\s\sI mean wtf is wrong with people?!

We must isolate the corporatists and disintegrate their power. Because when the leadership is right wing they won't represent the democratic voter they align more with the republicans. That means the left policies which are both factually better and more popular than their alternatives aren't passed in the house or senate. That's why despite the fact that Obama had a supermajority in senate people of this nation got Romneycare. Alao 2 things about the last few elections. Under Pelosi democrats lost over a thousand seats the house senate and presidency. Secondly this election clearly displayed that progressive win. One might argue ""but they didn't"" and the answer is many progressives lost by 5-10 points in +30-40 republican districts while they were outspent by their opponents by great margins and with no help fron the leadership of the party.Anyone else in a position of power with a record like hers would be in a new line of work. \s\sIf she truly cared about her party she would step down into an advisory role. Narrator: _She doesn't._ Id welcome a change to a more progressive Speaker but honestly right now halting the GOP's wanton destruction of our foundational values comes before transforming the (admittedly sold-out) opposition party so I hope we don't indulge in too much infighting Having a speaker who won't call them out for being sell outs is someone who has already admitted defeat. Pelosi has already signaled she wants a return to ""civility"" and unity she's already waived the white flag. I don't care how much infighting there needs to be the Pelosi wing of the party needs to learn their place: supporting progressives with their mouths shut. NO. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.

The smart thing. Funny how that perfect time never happens.\s\sPurity tests are unacceptable but purity time is eternal evidently.Now is not the time to divide the party. Let Pelosi be the voice of experience and let Mueller finish up. Anyone calling for her to step down is a dirty Russian until proved otherwise. Nothing is going to happen to Trump with the Mueller investigation. Nothing worthwhile is going to happen for democrats with Pelosi as speaker. She's going to try to pin one scandal after another on Trump and hope that the media outrage it generates helps dems win the presidency in 2020. It won't. It never does and her Republican-lite bi-partisan ""experience"" is killing the Democratic party.

These stock options are recorded as an expense. The expense is not only tax deductible but also deducted at its actual market price (even though the stock costs relatively less or nothing at offering for the company.)  When the company’s taxes are being paid the company is able to claim a “very large” tax deduction.As a whiny nice guy Jedi once said “I don’t think the system works”Actually it's working pretty well for having lost its secret weapon slavery almost three hundred years ago.This is amazing!!

This has been the subject of study for nearly 50 years in theoretical and in Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models.1 Nonetheless despite its policy relevance until very recently it received virtually no econometric investigation.\sThis paper re-examines the extent to which taxes on corporate income are passed on to workers in the form of lower wages. We make two main novel contributions. First we model a new mechanism by which corporate taxes may be passed on in lower wages: the wage bargain. We differentiate two aspects of the effective incidence of the tax. Differently from previous contributions we identify the direct incidence of the tax: given the pre-tax profit of the firm a higher tax bill will directly reduce the quasi-rent over which the workers and the company can bargain. The indirect incidence instead has an effect on wages through determining the level of pre-tax profit by affecting either investment or output prices. Second we test the size of this effect using unconsolidated firm-level accounting data for over 55000 companies in nine major European countries over the period 1996 to 2003. Variations in tax payments and effective tax rates arise due to both differences across countries and over time in the respondents believed that corporate income taxes are largely passed on to workers and consumers.\s \s\s>legal tax system and due to firm-specific factors. We identify the effects of taxation using all of these sources of variation.\sThe literature on the incidence of taxes on corporate income dates back to Harberger (1962) who developed a model of a closed economy with a corporate sector and a non-corporate sector and analysed the introduction of a tax only in the corporate segment of the economy. Harberger (1962) showed that the incidence of the tax depended on a number of factors including the elasticities of substitution between labour and capital used in each sector and between the goods produced in each sector. His main conclusion was that under reasonable assumptions the tax is borne by all owners of capital across both segments of the economy as it drives down the post-tax return to capital. A number of more complex CGE models with a larger number of sectors generate similar results (see for example Shoven 1976).\s\s>However these results depend crucially on among other things the assumption of a closed economy which restricts the supply of capital to the economy. If capital is perfectly mobile between countries but labour is not then the results can be very different. Bradford (1978) and Kotlikoff and Summers (1987) showed that the introduction of a tax on corporate income in a home country tends to reduce the world rate of return to capital and tends to shift capital from the home country to the rest of the world. This shift in capital reduces the return to labour in the home country and increases the return to labour abroad. As the home country becomes small relative to the rest of the world the effect on the world rate of return diminishes towards zero. There remains an exodus of capital and the domestic labour force effectively bears the entire burden of the tax. Indeed given a deadweight loss induced by the outward shift of capital the cost to the home country labour force can exceed the tax revenue generated. This suggests that a small open economy would be better off taxing immobile labour directly compared to imposing a tax which distorts the allocation of capital (Gordon 1986).\s\s[the above is an excerpt](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5293.pdf)Actually taxing corporations on their profits is a much better idea that would yield better results[deleted]Who isn't a declared enemy of Trump?

Risk of a slippery slope is very real. After the ball starts rolling it becomes very hard to predict what the effect will be. While not a problem for Amazon it'll kill small business hiring stone dead and those are the places where new jobs are born.\s\sBesides the best way to achieve the same effect is to set a reasonable minimum wage and both minimum and maximum amount of work hours allowed per worker. That way there won't be ""zero-hour"" contracts where you are eternally in reserve and predicting the (minimum) pay you're earning is easy. It's much harder to abuse on all three sides so I don't hold much hope for it.> While not a problem for Amazon it'll kill small business hiring stone dead and those are the places where new jobs are born.\s\sThe tax only applies to businesses with 500+ employees not small businesses.Waitso I don't get it\s\sWhat are those ""benefits""?

Bradford (1978) and Kotlikoff and Summers (1987) showed that the introduction of a tax on corporate income in a home country tends to reduce the world rate of return to capital and tends to shift capital from the home country to the rest of the world. This shift in capital reduces the return to labour in the home country and increases the return to labour abroad. As the home country becomes small relative to the rest of the world the effect on the world rate of return diminishes towards zero. There remains an exodus of capital and the domestic labour force effectively bears the entire burden of the tax. Indeed given a deadweight loss induced by the outward shift of capital the cost to the home country labour force can exceed the tax revenue generated. This suggests that a small open economy would be better off taxing immobile labour directly compared to imposing a tax which distorts the allocation of capital (Gordon 1986).\s\s[the above is an excerpt](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5293.pdf)> The bill would establish a 100% tax on companies equal to the benefits their employees are receiving. Covered public assistance program include Medicaid Section 8 housing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs for companies with more than 500 employees.\s\s[Serious Question] Why not companies with more than 50 employees? Or all companies who employ anyone receiving public assistance?He doesn’t want to hurt small businessesOh dammmmn that’s a burnSocial experiment....replace the bills author from  Bernie Sanders to a republican or conservative politician just to see if the people that are against it now have a different response. Thanks Bernie I am tired of subsidizing corporate earnings with my taxes.This is going to kill all of the small sports programs. Only b-ball and football will surviveDo you know what businesses are going start doing? Not hire/fire people on welfare and other gov't benefits. I don't see this working out as intended....Yup. With the affordable care act employers were disincentivized from giving their employees full-time gigs. If this passes they’d be disincentivized from staffing part-time low income earners at all.This is how you speed up tech replacing low cost labor.Simpler route 1000 a monthYou must not know any landlords.\s\sThe day Yang implemented his Freedom Dividend rents would skyrocket as landlords said “thank you” to the federal government for a massive shift in wealth from the public sphere to the private. Not to mention fuel and utilities. Corporations would know that everyone has an extra grand in their pocket.\s\sThe problem is wealth inequality and throwing crumbs to the masses will only exacerbate it. We’ll have to actually shift _wealth_ from the ruling class to the working class by unionizing and raising wages.Overly simple route imo. Read [Four Futures](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/12/four-futures/) for a common socialist perspective on UBI.

If you pay them enough to not be on welfare they won't be on welfare.\s\sThat's the entire point of this bill.whatTo your point below the idea behind this is that they pay a liveable wage rather than one that forces people onto welfare to make ends meet. So they should hire people who don't need welfare..... because they are actually compensated properly???That was my first thought as well. Companies aren't going to pay taxes they can avoid they'll just fire those who are on welfare and keep workers who don't apply for aid.Fucking.

I checked it in Removeddit and there wasn't nearly as much trolling comments as I would have guessed.That's awesome! The enthusiasm for Bernie is the real deal. And it's good to be reminded of that.I posted a comment but it didn't show up. Any suggestions?Did you prefix your question with ""DrJaye from WayOfTheBern here...""?Are you shadow banned ?I would like to repost my list of S4P questions here on WOTB.  I am hopeful at least one subreddit reader might find it more than boring.\s\s1. Senator Sanders *how would you plan to persuade apathetic or apolitical voters or voters who first voted for Obama (even twice) but then voted for Trump to vote for you and the Democrats?*\s2. Opponents of Medicare For All like to claim that it would take away healthcare or health insurance from 150 to 180 million Americans as well as raise taxes implying M4A would make American healthcare cost more and be worse. I see these points as outrageous mis-characterizations of Medicate For All plans but there's no lack of media people and politicians even Democrats running for president who repeatedly say these things. I thought the ACA was a step in the right direction but it was also was a half-measure which preserved for-profit industry interestsand yet it is still something which has been actively undermined by Republicans including the U.S. Supreme Court. *Does the American public believe our healthcare system with its current problems and increasing costs is on a reasonable trajectory without changing course?*\s3. Senator Sanders by what criteria should American voters evaluate the relative success or failure of the American economy when considering who to vote for or whether to participate in the political processes at all? If the stock market is currently ""roaring"" does that mean everything is okay?\s4. Senator Sanders media coverage of you often says or implies that you are too negative (e.g. potentially ""demonizing"") about corporate power billionaires very rich people who aren't quite billionaires and the current state of American government. If American government doesn't actually provide effective oversight and policing of corporate power and externalities now I wonder whether there's a chance America will ever be able to effectively regulate and govern corporate power. I didn't wake up this morning inspired to hate Mr. Bezos or the Walton heirs because I probably don't hate them at all. Maybe everything 'good and American' or 'American and good' comes from the good graces of corporate power and influence over the population?\s5. I'm worried America has a world-wide empire and that partially explains our military spending plus media episodes about Iran or Iraq or Syria or Honduras or Venezuela being a problem where we are somehow compelled to be involved. Modern day gun-boat diplomacy. It seems way beyond ordinary security and defense interests in my opinion. Senator Sanders any comment?Do all of you read Bernie's answers with his voice in your head like I do? \s\sOn a serious note I found about half of his answers to be way too boilerplate. A couple of very specific questions he didn't even really answer just gave generalities. If Bernie (was it really him or a staffer hmmmm?) is going to take the time for a written AMA give detailed responses.So it wasn't just me noticing.\s\sLooked like speech/tweet/policy cut n pastes other than the favorite ice cream. And often they did not address the meat of the question they were purportedly answering.\s\sAlso huge numbers of good fairly straighforward questions just bypassed during window of responses made - remarkably few were actually answered. Why?Bernie thinks DNCforpresident is a legit subreddit. big OOFs.Visit the OP of the comment's video where he links out to bis business in the description of his video:  \s    \shttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tji3ieDlaak  \s   \sThanks /u/patsy-and-b!It may have seemed strange to some at first but Bernies willingness to talk on conservative news and podcasts is gonna be the thing that will make him the next presidentConservatives often disagree with Bernie on a range of subjects (agree on others) but they also respect him as a principled human being.   Most of them recognize that this is a rare quality for a politician.Ya it's great he's taking the time to include the ""opposing"" side and to show that they're not against each other. I've read the polls even righties want what bernie is offering. They often don't know until they hear it. And they wouldn't hear it if he didn't take the time to actually be inclusive. Which bernie is.\s\sIf he does t become your next president can we borrow him for our next prime minister? We'll return him I promise!This is what happens when bernie gets heard.\s\sBuilding that tsunami one individual or one group at a time.Moments like this make me think we need to do more pro-business messaging. While we rightly point out that Bernie's plans help people they also help businesses.\s\sMedicare for All would be a huge win especially to entrepreneurs trying to start a new business. Free College creates a better educated work force which would help Tech companies. Raising the minimum wage and erasing student debt gives people more disposable income to buy companies products.\s\sBernie is a win-win candidate!My partner worked for a company who gave their employees a choice - health insurance or a 401k plan. He could not do both. Naturally the employees chose health insurance.\s\sThe small business owner is right not having to provide health insurance would allow him to offer better benefits.\s\sThere are business groups out there advocating for M4A. Here are two that I've been pointing people to especially small business owners:\s\s[Business for Medicare for All](http://www.businessformedicareforall.org/)\s\s[Business Initiative for Health Policy](https://businessinitiative.org/)On the one hand hooray! Another person reached.\s\sOn the other holy shit how could this person have really been that clueless for so long? Could they seriously not have done their own research on this topic?> Could they seriously not have done their own research on this topic?\s\sYeah sadly. I was in the US a couple months ago. Met with my very bright young engineer niece and her very bright young programmer boyfriend for lunch one day. Both are just out of university one year at the time. I started picking their brains about US politics and they both really had no idea who stood for what. They know that they don't know but they are really busy. I can imagine a small business owner in the US would have even less time to research. And if they were under the impression that the news they are getting is more or less objective they're not going to dig. This is of course exactly what the oligarch media wants.[deleted]Articles like that one teachers getting their school supplies through Gofundme kids setting up fundraisers to pay for necessities and more all show what a crazy warped society we live in :(Below is a response to the post on r/Our President\s\s[https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/cq2j4g/business\_owner\_slams\_corporate\_media\_for/ewvocd4?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/cq2j4g/business_owner_slams_corporate_media_for/ewvocd4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\s\sThis was a result of my looking for a link to the original quote because I wanted to use it in a personal discussion with a business person I know but I am much too cautious that to use material I can't accredit.

The media misled a lot of people and there is still much suffering from that brutal lie going on to this dayYou know what's funny about M4A taking the burden off small business employers?\s\sJoe Biden made this garbage argument against it:\s\s> “Right now you have this overwhelming number of employers who are paying into the health care plan. **Why let them off the hook?** All the sudden they don’t have to pay anything? What happens then to this whole thing about profit and the rest?”\s\sJoe Biden will attack small business owners when it's convenient for healthcare industry executives. Pro-business fiscal conservative... not so much!\s\sThe implication of ""What happens then to this whole thing about profit and the rest?"" is amusing. Biden's so out of touch that he thinks the best way to blend in is to be outraged about the mere fact that businesses make profit.Is that on video? Needs to be used in attack ads.I had held out hope that Meredith Corporation would turn Time Magazine into some sort of objective media. But they sold it off to billionaire Mark Benioff almost as soon as they acquired it.\sO don't hold similar hope for Gannett to ever turn USA Today into anything other than a slick colorful donut to go with your morning coffee.USA Today bought up the Bergen Record and fired a lot of the local reporters.

Putting aside the relative cost (which was the main reason they did it) the results were impressive on their own. Given the ratio of cases needing force vs those that don't (there's a serious imbalance there in favor of ""don't"") it's mind blowing that this isn't headline news.> it's mind blowing that this isn't headline news.\s\sAt *this* point I'd be more surprised if it actually *was* headline news.So  every problem isnt a nail after all. But for 6 months I've been told the only alternative to a corrupt fascist police state is to fire all police and legalize crime. I cant believe that common  sense exists!So say we do a laughably simplistic run at the numbers: LAPD has around 9000 police officers (a bit larger than a US Army infantry division) for a metro area of 4 million people. Most ""calls for service"" that officers respond to are not specifically crime related and even most crime related calls are for traffic stops (around 10% of calls). Consistent with policing across the country officers are only called to deal with serious violent crime in under 5% of calls. So if armed LAPD officers were only assigned to say the 5% of calls that were for serious violent crime could you do that job with 500 officers and hire 9500 social workers traffic agents  unarmed investigators and paramedics to handle the rest? Maybe. LA county really spread out geographically so the logistics of ensuring rapid response times would be a challenge depending on how many officers you needed to roll at any given time. But if we put aside the truly nonsensical idea that every cop needs to be doing something all the time (something we don't require for infantry units held in reserve or on sentry duty) it's not hard to imagine their numbers could be dramatically reduced in proportion to the actual work they were given. None of that means real crime is being legalized. It means that you refrain from sending in an armed response except where necessary. It's about reducing the risk of escalating violence not looking the other way. It can also be about improving effectiveness especially when you deploy experienced specialists instead of superficially trained generalists. Finally it does afford you the opportunity to decriminalize behavior like drug addiction you couldn't afford to before because money that would otherwise have gone into public health was tied up in a failed law enforcement project. https://www.freethink.com/articles/how-police-spend-their-time (I linked to this article because it's the best I could find that accurately recaps the NYT article on the subject and I don't want to send people into a paywall).

FUBAR!!!1!These guys are attacking Joe Biden (as they should) but proping up Trump these people are fake ass progressives all along Fuck Trump\sAm Mexican American and will never vote trump or Republicans no matter how much they try to convince us here.Good news I know we ain’t getting Medicare 4 All under a Biden presidency but at least he’s not going to gut Obamacare which covers pre existing conditions.\sAnd before I get snarky comments it’s easy to say when you weren’t born with a defect or develop cancer later in life.We don't need the ACA framework to protect people with pre-existing conditions. It is and always was possible to regulate insurance to require that. Now ask yourself why your heroes never once tried to do that.I like how you are thinking. And i don't mean this in a snarky way.# FUCKING VOTEI will vote just not for filthy lying greedy Democrats.But only if it's the way that you think Americans should vote right?You should probably NOT push so very many disaffected left of center voters with aggression and smug orders....\s\s...it's much more likely to blow up in estb Dems' faces.\s\sJSDon't worry. I will. For Howie Hawkins.And immediately the Trump twitter-twats pile on.  The only way in which they might be better than their counterparts at Correct the Record is that I could believe they're doing it for kicks rather than for cash.\s\sNow that Trump has done the two main jobs I wanted him to (and seems to be wimping out on his only other campaign positions that seemed promising) it will be a relief to stop having to bend over backwards not to criticize their shit too strongly.:-D  I'm in agreement.  It's only been 8 or 9 days though.  Let's give him *one* more...And sadly Senator all too sadly nope there is apparently NO Republican Senator that will stand with the American people.\s\sSeparate from whatever happens when the voting is done this vote perhaps more than any other will long endure in the collective minds of the American people.  \s\sThe thing to do is to keep that memory alive and very much present come election day 2018.\s\sLast I knew Republicans Collins and Murkowski were on record as opposing DeVos:  has that changed?Biden is almost certainly studying the questions he'll be asked. But he still won't have a teleprompter. Or will he?\s\sThere's still time for this to be canceled or ""postponed"" or for it to be announced that the candidates will each broadcast from separate locations (allowing Joe to have a teleprompter that Bernie won't know about) or...something. There's no way they aren't going to do everything possible to prop up Biden or avoid the debate entirely.I'd bet a lot of money that he will have a hidden earpiece with a voice telling him what to say.   And yes that his handlers were given the questions in advance.    However this could work to our advantage: Biden may forget about the earpiece and conclude that there are voices in his head or that God is speaking to him and make this known to the public.Where can we see it streaming?

While Sanders has been mulling a bid for months one of the sources said he was emboldened by early polls of the race that have consistently showed him as one of the top candidates in a crowded Democratic primary field. In particular the source said Sanders was heartened to see numbers indicating he is one of the leading candidates among African American and Latino voters two groups he was perceived as struggling with in 2016.\s\s>The source also alluded to a spate of recent polls that show Sanders as the most popular politician in the country. They attributed Sanders’ strength in the polls to the base and name recognition he built with the prior presidential bid.\s\s>“What the senator has this time that he didn’t have last time is he is the most popular elected official in the country right now” the source said. “That’s light years away from 2016 when very few people knew who he was.”\s\s--------------\s\s>In addition to these two sources a former Sanders staffer who was not been briefed on the imminent announcement plans nevertheless said they were aware of many recent signs he is set to pull the trigger on a presidential campaign. Specifically the former staffer said Sanders has been building out the infrastructure he would need for a White House bid.\s\s>“He’s already talking to staff and there are people he’s hiring. They’re nailing down contracts with vendors … all the movement is there for him to run” the ex-staffer said.> he is one of the leading candidates among African American and Latino voters two groups he was perceived as struggling with in 2016.\s\sOf course he wasn’t truly struggling with POCs it’s just that propagandist Charles Blow and all of the other high profile AA Dem Establishment mouthpieces were brainwashing their audiences to *believe* that Bernie was a racist old man from an all white state who had no idea about the lives of minority populations...those scumbags had better be careful this time around because we are going to fight back loudly and incessantly...Credit card ready......And as soon as he announces I will take $27 of my first post-federal furlough paycheck and give.

As they have drifted further and further right over the last 30 years the Democrats are no longer the party of FDR. They are Rockefeller Republicans. \s\sIt makes absolutely no sense for the left to be part of the Democratic coalition. These are the kinds of realignments that either give birth to a new party or render an existing party completely non-viable resulting in sustained one-party rule.The Dem establishment created the split by not fighting for Medicare for All and climate action.Perfect description of Bernie’s voter base!!\s\sToo bad the DNC is too moronic to accept it.\s\sGreen voters won’t vote for Biden.\s\sMost Independents won’t vote for Biden.\s\sMany of Bernie’s Democratic supporters won’t vote for Biden.\s\sHow do they think that Biden can win??\s\sThe answer is that they don’t their goal has always been to *stop* Bernie!They make way too much damned money by losing.

That would dilute their power.\s\sI'm so sick of all these ""The Dem party needs to learn such-and-such"" posts. They know all this stuff that's why they act they way they do.“Splitting the vote” is not even an appropriate term.  It’s a two-man primary.  By definition you need at least 3 candidates to split the vote.You're goddamn right. I've voted Green since 2008. Alright I voted for Ralph Nader in 08 and he was independent in that election. I changed my registration to vote for Bernie in 2016 and moved to an open primary state in 2020. I'm going to vote for a Green over Biden Diaro Hunter or Howie.

It will be some amalgam of new-minted savior trend-maker and stealth insider.  Biden won’t make it to November.

In fact apologizing and rationalizing for the split is a super cuck move. \s\sHe is splitting the party into people who stand for the party's values and people who want to cling on to a neoliberal center-right fuck-the-poors agenda. What he's doing is bringing the party back to what it's supposed to be and any split in the party is a necessary side-effect. \s\sWe should be chastising the center-right fuckers for ruining the party.

Which doesn't really fix the problems we see in terms of inequality.\s\sThis is a valid critique of ""enlightened centrism"" -- whereby you accurately identify the symptoms but are wrong about the root causes and/or don't give a sh** about solving them.\s\sIt is NOT a valid critique of actual progressives such as are routinely elected in western Europe. These are the folks who promote union membership effective welfare provisions and social benefits like free college free healthcare etc. Those are things that promote class equality. A modern ""class equality"" discussion/policy should be expected to include race/ethnicity/religion.\s\sFixing the economy to be fairer doesn't cure the hearts an minds of the populace automatically cleansing it of racism. It does give marginalized people better legs to stand on economically. And it does give the people at large less to gripe about in their lives. Restless angst leads to scapegoating by opportunists. One would hope that broad-based economic prosperity for all would reduce the scapegoating that is the coal to the fire of racist groups/movements.\s\sIn Tucker's shell game he discards a sincere will to help people (true progressivism) in favor of branding the liberals as bad (""owning the libs""). But without progressivism there is no-one left to fix economic issues (""class divisions"") nor is there anyone to address racial inequality (which he seems to be saying is a smokescreen even though it's one of America's most enduring and core problems.)\s\sTucker is throwing away essentially the whole shell game by the end of it. The balls are gone (lol) the cups are empty. It is you could say a hollow argument.\s\sIt's all a big razzle-dazzle. It's entertainment. But it's not real analysis. It seems disingenuous as heck to say what he says from a position of (almost definitely) knowing better.No he's not. It's the cable TV equivalent of click bait.Did Tucker just go full commie?Fascists often co-opt the language of class warfare in order to deceive. Trump did it while he was running.This is about a year old and amazon has already agreed to pay $15 way back.\sOP is a little too fond of Tucker looking at his very right wing history.No this is very suspicious.

In a day or two he'll be back to calling Bernie a Bolshevik and insisting that the GOP are the true party of the working class.Still gotta say Tucker who?Bezos is a Bond villain but reducing the argument to ""the richest man in the world"" who happens to be enemies with the current Pres and the Republican party mainstream doesn't really move the needle in discussing the entire problem with the 1%. When Tucker starts bashing WalMart or all the other low cost retailers I might question whether or not he has regained his soul. About that....\s\sDid so tonight. Brutally. Keep listening to all of it\s\shttps://youtu.be/F3h5VTLpEos\s\sOh.I'm guessing that Tucker Carlson is only championing the poor worker in this case because Trump has issues with Jeff Bezos. The guy is so disingenuous that he says things he does not believe because he gets to be famous and paid for it.Neolibs use identity politics not because they care about it but because it distracts from class/economic issues. Tucker is the opposite. He talks about class/economic issues not because he cares about them but because he is trying to leverage them against anybody trying to fight against bigotry which is his real bread and butter.\s\sTucker Carlson is [not your friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNOAfMJBdZQ)The best way to “fight against bigotry” is through class/economic issues.  Bigotry is harmless cultural detritus until it is weaponized by economic insecurity.  It is only then that the scapegoating begins followed by a peculiar sort of populism with a racial bias.  We aren’t there yet.  It’s still possible to seize the populist moment but first we have to move the neoliberal corpse from the commanding heights of the party.\s\sBesides there is no way to legislate bigotry out of existence.  Only class and economic policy holds the possibility of making class allies of diverse people.  This was MLK’s stance anyway.Alright guys--can we NOT post stuff from neo-nazi loving white nationalists like Tucker Carlson? I understand that what he is saying here is true and it goes along with certain ideals we support but again (and I can't stress this enough) the guy is a neo-nazi loving white nationalist.\s\sLets not prop up pieces of shit just because they happen to say something agreeable. I mean I heard Hitler loved dogs but you don't see me posting pics of him with his german shepherd on r/aww.Tucker Carlson talking about plutocrats is not the worst thing that could happen. It does us no good to post it here but at some point the 99-percenters on the left and the right are going to have to find common ground to knock down the plutocrats. Tucker Carlson has half of those people in his audience and we don't so it's okay to celebrate when sensible things come out of his mouth. He reaches people we can't.\s\sNina Turner replied to his tweet. Refusing to engage them even when they make sense will do us no good.are you upset because the democratic candidates are again being shown for who they really are? \s\sbtw you’re using a very commonly used retort used by Shareblue/CTRAlright guy you are entitled to your opinion but you do not *dictate* what we can post.\s\sYou (and I can't stress this enough) can ram your concern up your ass.I agree; it lends credibility to a shit. Do we need this a-hole to lend credibility to the class war going on? No. Because he's going to leverage whatever support you give him to talk about ""demographic changes.""\s\sI would argue that he's not a neo-nazi lover he just is desperate to be relevant and Fox was hiring.Wow.  Like this room wasn't vile enough...now quoting our national figurehead of neonazis and the alt-right.  Hitler probably said some very nice things about his mom...maybe post that next.  He liked puppies too.\s\sAn actual analysis would be ""Why is this the only billionaire Tucker Carlson hates?""**And he's not the only tech billionaire offloading his payroll costs onto taxpayers.**\s\sIt's right there in plain English.What is your vile ass doing here?  \s\sSmug tone policing and garbage spewing it looks like.  \s\sGet some help with the creepy Hitler fixation.[Godwin's law 1st corollary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) applies here. \s\s> An actual analysis would be ""Why is this the only billionaire Tucker Carlson hates?""\s\sThat would be ""another analysis."" The analysis by Carlson is important because he is a national news figure with a huge following not just among white nationals.\s\sStalin liked puppies too. Stalin and Hitler were enemies.

The breathless idiots crying about Nazis and Russians need to fuck off. Conservatives don't need to be punched or boycotted for their opinions.Just some random thoughts here but I wonder is the DNC intentionally sabotaging its own 2020 chances because they know for certain that Bernie is going to win and they want to make the Democratic Party look like incompetent morons who no one would ever want to vote for?\s\sEven if Bernie overcomes their shit reputation and wins the general they would want to purposefully lose the house/senate to Republicans to let them resist Bernie.\s\sIt's super obvious that their end game is to stop Bernie no matter what even at the expense of their own preservation. Are they attempting to suicide bomb his campaign?I believe they are. They are inflicting so much damage to their own party that nobody will able to beat Trump no matter who the nominee is. Final Iowa poll botched Iowa Caucus botched impeachment botched changing the rules for Bloomberg etc. The DNC is the biggest adversary we face as Americans.We reap what we sow.  Or we try to reap what others have sown but that can have downsides.\s\sIt was Nixon in 1971 that proposed ""to put a floor under the families with children"" a kind of UBI. Seems that Steenhamland England's example was being measured for use in the War On Poverty.\s\sBut it was Democrats in Senate that wore down the Nixon's attempt. The result was the welfare state that encouraged fathers to leave so moms get the govt money.  The ""economic deserts"" called ghettos were filled by the drug economy along with dangers of that lifestyle.\s\sOP may as well say ""All men are *not* created equal"".  You inherit genes passed down from many ancestors but your own environment is going to imprint you with skills for your survival or destruction.Nixon's plan was called the Family Assistance Program. Very unfortunate acronym even more disturbing if associated with Nixon.I got my destruction skills cold.\s\s""Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" is a well-known phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence.

Our Lives Matter.There are not enough jobs so then what?  There will always be those who don't want to work but there are actually very few.  Having food shelter and medical just the minimum to survive is really not much in the grand picture.  Most people would find it boring to do nothing and also have a need to interact with other people.  There are many many people who donate their time because they find being useful is meaningful and get pleasure from it.Make work voluntary provide ubi and Medicare for all but also give opportunity to those who want it.I never asked to be born. I don’t feel entitled to anything but I think it’s ridiculous that they kicked me out of the house at 18 with no money no help no place to live. It made me feel like I was just an accessory item to my boomer parents relationship and status. I was the perfect son of the perfect family. 2 story house in the suburbs boating on the weekends pizza delivery fridays. I got paraded around and shown off like I fell from heaven. Then there was the divorce. Then new step-parents. Then I was quiet started staying in my room rather than going outside. Then I got mercilessly bullied in highschool then kicked out of the house shortly after graduation. \s\sI slept on couches and eventually saved up enough minimum wage $ to rent rooms from friends for a bit. Then I got my own place for 2 years lost my job during the recession went back to couches and renting rooms. I’ve been on food stamps worked job-a-day been like #400-350 in line at the temp agency for 3 months straight etc. The veins in my arms are fucked up from having to sell my blood and plasma to survive.\s\sMy parents both had their education and housing paid for immediately out of highschool. My dads folks bought them their first house as a graduation present. They both got high paying jobs before they were even legal to drink.\s\sAnyways as I said I’m not entitled. I just feel kind of bitter that they’d bring me into this world and build me up up up to abandon.Damn I’m so sorry to hear that. You’re a tough person.If I were you I would have turned to crime by now.I would't say that ""earn a living"" means you don't derserve to live I would probably say its more along the line of ""you have no right to live""“You can earn a living just off this one community”[deleted]Many subscribe to that idea. However most politicians either don't say it in public or find a way to say it differently.  For example Presidents can express it simply by sending Congress a budget that cuts fuel subsidies for the poor and Congress can agree and also reduce or abolish other so-called ""entitlements""  like Medicaid or ""welfare as we know it"" (or once knew it).\s\sOn the flip side some work does need to be done by someone or none of us can survive.High tide is supposed to raise all boats but the mooring ropes keep getting shortened.I quite like this because it's one of those things where I can agree with the person on the concept but say that there are other factors in reality that negate that. If we simplify the economy to hunter gatherer times it is true that you must work to survive. If you do not gather food you will starve. In that sense you could see today as a more complicated version of that where if you do not work to earn money for food you die. However the automation and advanced tools we have make things so cheap that if someone cannot take care of themselves we can do the work for them easily with little impact on everyone else. I agree that if you can work though you should. Whatever you eat someone had to grow/kill/transport that and it's not fair to demand someone else do that for you in any way without reason for not doing it yourself. That's akin to slavery and no one should be treated so unfairlyThat simplification of hunter gatherer economy is missing a lot; not all hunted or gathered. They took care of those who couldn't and they valued other contributions to the community as well. It's also notable that there is a lot of evidence that they had more leisure time than us too.\s\sI am curious about what you mean when you say all that can work should do you qualify what work is valuable enough to satisfy this notion of fairness? Are certain jobs more worthy than others of allowing you to live? Or do the jobs simply beed to benefit the community?I also think that people who chose to work should earn more than those who don't. The idea that we're all okay with the idle rich just blows my mindI don’t understand the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality when essentially there are no bootstraps. Also no one asks to be born.I mean yeah even before any form of market or trade was established this already held true. Survival has always been a part of any living organism.Add to that the fact that humans are pack animals by nature and can realistically only thrive if able community members contribute to the whole.Smh.  The idea of “earning a living” derived from the reality that it takes effort to live.  If you’re living without any effort then someone else is contributing effort for your survival.I think about this a lot. I mean the default setting in nature is that we all have to do some work to survive. Even if we were primitive hunter-gatherers hundreds of years ago we’d still have to do some labor to build a shelter gather food and locate clean water. Regardless of what society you live in part of living does have to be “earned” through our own labor or the labor of others.\s\sIt’s when people in modern times equate “earning a living” to working a menial job to make someone else rich so that you can “earn” the minimum wage you need to barely sustain a crappy life that I get mad about this rhetoric.Thats kindof civilization as a whole though. We all contribute to a big ""pot"" that many members of society use at different times of their life.\s\sIt was true in tribes and its true now just the mechanisms are differentWhich is fine when your job is to learn and become more capable or you're literally unable to provide for yourself but if you literally aspire to do nothing your entire life you're not really contributing.[deleted]When the story is goodI don’t want to live anymoreIn New England we claim this all the time. And in Texas and Ohio I've seen it.MORE RIGHTS PLEASEIn the opposing world you have a right to life until you’re born. After that you have a right to survival life’s a privilege. \s\s# Wealth Inequality in America  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM)Nah you have a right for someone not too actively kill you it is your own responsibility (or that of your parents if a child) to actively not die y’all do realise people work to provide you with food water and shelter right??>y’all do realise people work to provide you with food water and shelter right??\s\sA lot of the people working hard to provide those things to you are paid minimum wage. Many of them are homeless because they can't afford to pay rent.As long as we conveniently ignore the current economic crisis which has displaced tens of millions of Americans and put them out of work and the fact millions of those jobs are never returning AND the extra pressure that will have on driving down wages and benefits as people desperately compete for a finite number of jobs then SURE!\s\sOh and then there's the little problem of mass unrest fomenting because people are losing their savings jobs cars health and lives (because of a pandemic looming about) and going homeless.I see you enjoy rugged individualism.The world could work just fine without money... of course we would then have to all love each other if it's to continue to function without that cash.

Who owns my place and why/what do I owe them?I mean not really. At all. \s\sEarning a living means the quality of your life is what you make of it and put into it. Not that if you don’t have money you don’t deserve to live. \s\sThis is the among the dumbest takes I’ve heard in a very long while.>Earning a living means the quality of your life is what you make of it and put into it. \s\sHow do you see that principle as working within our current system of financialized capitalism?> Earning a living\s\sNever heard of that statement.  There's a phrase similar to ""someone does x to earn for a living"" which is vastly different that ""earn a living"" what James implies.  In the old days people had to hunt fish forage etc... for food.  Nothing came easy to those folks.We say this all the time in New England. And I’ve heard it in Texas and Ohio.You could hunt/gather/farm for your own food. Build and maintain your own shelter. Make your own clothes and live off the grid... or you can pay other people to provide that for you by using your time elsewhereWell no. Because it’s really not legal to do any of that without licenses that cost money skills that cost money to learn and property on which to do it all.\s\sIt’s also incredibly inefficient and we simply do not have the land on earth for people to do that.\s\sAnd people wouldn’t be complaining if their work provided enough to live off of but it does not.There's a reason there's reality TV about that shit. It's super rare that you even can legally do so and extremely difficult to manage but they'd love to pretend everyone can do anything in this country. The pretense of freedom makes the best shackles.If the US had a [Charter of the Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_Forest) which guaranteed citizens had unfettered access to the land to hunt and gather for resources so they could survive then sure you'd have a good suggestion.\s\sUnfortunately privatization has eliminated the Commons in America so your idea isn't feasible. \s\sTLDR: The right to private property without any regulations is theft.\s\sAnd before you defend unrestricted rights to private property Benjamin Franklin was quite clear on how wealth and private property should be viewed and treated in the US:\s\s>All Property indeed except the Savage's temporary Cabin his Bow his Matchcoat and other little Acquisitions absolutely necessary for his Subsistence seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents and all other Conveyances of Property and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species is his natural Right which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick who by their Laws have created it and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition.

Mostly just children of people who ""claimed"" huge swaths of land.Lol you have to pay for the land to build your home on 🙄Yep.\s\sIf you choose the former you still have to work.UBI is trash. Inflation and abusing the system would never let this succeed. In a day where young kids know nothing more than how to operate a smart phone and post tic tocks I can’t see this ending up well. The people who don’t work all of a sudden will have less power (since they’re obviously more expendable to society) and it will create larger gaps between each social class. Once enough people are out on their ass with no valuable skills it’s back to joe tax payer to funds their useless ass. Sounds like San Francisco to me. \s\sI’m all for helping people out and I don’t know the magic answer but I sure as hell know it’s not UBIInflation can be controlled by COLA so that's not an issue. As for having expendable Americans nothing would fundamentally change from the current system either but at least with UBI people could afford basic necessities and you as a worker would have more bargaining power. \s\sWould you rather have these people competing for jobs and lowering your wages and standard of living while a wealthy unaccountable elite continue to own and control more land resources and control our government like is already happening and continuing to get worse?Well the alternative is Universal Basic Services and a job guarantee. But that's not what capitalism will choose because in a way UBI is a capitalist communism. It doesn't challenge the system of private ownership and production it merely redistributes better.Then sit at home watching Netflix and smoking weed for life and feel fullfilled. You wont. Socialist countries have alot of suicides for a reason.[deleted]You don't have to earn a living. You can set up a tent in the homeless camps and eat scraps and shit like an animal or someone from prehistory. Or you can get a job to get paid for your labor and pay for nicer things. This isn't a complicated conspiracy. It's literally how civilization functions EVERYWHERE.>You can set up a tent in the homeless camps\s\sI mean can you? How long until law enforcement decides you need to be moved out of the way in the interest of the construction of more luxury condos for billionaires to park their money in? And that's assuming you don't get imprisoned on some trumped up charges or endure violence through some extralegal circumstances that nobody cares enough to investigate and prosecute.  \s\s\sLook the most expensive part of having a living in this day and age entails having space on which some owner collects rent on purely due to the fact that's the main way residences are organized in capitalist society.   \s\s\sThe homeless person in the camp has literally no right to the ground they're lying on. Every square centimeter of western civilization is very strictly spoken for and yeah there is an implication that if you are not paying rent to someone or are not an owner yourself you don't have a right to exist because inherently you need physical space in which to exist.  \s\s\sNon-capitalists propose alternative ways of allocating land that look beyond the ownership model at least for primary residence and that's why the op quote actually holds some water.Yeah just be lazy and leech off the government and fight capitalism even though youre living off of it and never work or earn money for yourself thats just cringe bro communism good broWhen you’ve turned into your own parody>never work or earn money for yourself thats just cringe bro communism good bro\s\sYou don't think people work under a system of communism?You are an idiot.

Admitting it makes you feel worse for saying that to poor people so you pretend it doesn't.NO that's not what it implies.  \s\s\sWhat it means is that  you are taking up space and resources on a crowded planet and that  you are co-responsible for caring for the Creation into which you have been born admittedly against your will and without your advice and consent. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sNevertheless what you do to give value for your t time here is the rent you pay.

Although nobody should bust their hump for a big corporation while getting abused by the system society needs contributors. If you want a house food warm clothes heating etc this is stuff that needs to be earned at least by someone. None of that stuff happens for free.\s\sEven on a universal income model that money has to come from somewhere.\s\sEdit: The fact that this is getting down voted shows just how naive so many of you are.

But he has been candidate?Bernie is playing hardball with the DNC to help insure the election of Ellison as DNC Chairman.  Shrewd move.  Does anyone else listen to Ellison and ...get nothing from the guy? I've listed to a lot of YouTube vids and he just falls flat with me. In comparison I listen to Nina Turner and I get exactly the same vibes I got from Bernie. Add to my reservations about Ellison he attended a David Brooks event rather than the women's March and he won't call out the DNC for rigging the primary. If he gets the job I'll continue to listen to what he has to say but I won't be changing party affiliation to Dem without a reckoning.He should never give it to them. If they elect Ellison (who is already compromised and won't admit the primary was rigged) that is a step in the right direction but then Ellison has to show he works for US -- the people on the list -- and not THEM -- the Democratic elite and their corporate paymasters. Then he has to get a bunch of progressives into the House in 2018 showing that he's on board with the right corrections AND the party isn't sabotaging him.\s\sONLY THEN *maybe* should Bernie give the party the list. And I'd still be in favor of an online vote. It should be easy to do: you'd just have to verify your contact information on the list to get to cast your vote.Bernie himself doesn't admit that the primary was rigged. I wouldn't take that as a complete writeoff of the man. Look at his plans for the DNC and support or don't based on that. But yes Ellison should definitely put up before he's trusted.

""How can we fake caring about people so that they'll give us money?""  Also Hillary outspent Trump 2-to-1 fundraising isn't the Dems problem.  However much Trump's actions since the election have undermined it and however unpleasant his rhetoric he identified the suffering of great swathes of people across the country (like Bernie did) and said he was going to fix it.  Hillary said she's a woman and isn't Trump.  And since the election the Dems have doubled down on ignoring the people in favor of their donors.  At least I can respect the Republicans a bit even if I disagree with them.  Their stance on most things is consistent with what they claim to represent and what much of their base supports.  The Dems on the other hand support mostly the same things in opposition to what they are supposed to stand for and the wishes of their baseYe boi I left the D's after CA primary.  I'll reregister as a Dem if Ellison is made head of DNC.  Othewise Phuckthatsh*tHow do we know Ellison will be any better?

He’ll just let biden expose himself 😂 remember that one debate where Bernie had joe straight up malfunctioning calling him the president and his friend vermont. Bernie is smart enough to get Biden all wrapped up.Biden is almost certainly studying the questions he'll be asked. But he still won't have a teleprompter. Or will he?\s\sThere's still time for this to be canceled or ""postponed"" or for it to be announced that the candidates will each broadcast from separate locations (allowing Joe to have a teleprompter that Bernie won't know about) or...something. There's no way they aren't going to do everything possible to prop up Biden or avoid the debate entirely.I'd bet a lot of money that he will have a hidden earpiece with a voice telling him what to say.   And yes that his handlers were given the questions in advance.    However this could work to our advantage: Biden may forget about the earpiece and conclude that there are voices in his head or that God is speaking to him and make this known to the public.Where can we see it streaming?

He even did this right before ""reluctantly"" authorizing the coup in Libya. \s\sIn 2008 and his early presidency Obama [often bragged about ""his passionate anti war activism""](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99591469) \s\s>.The following is a transcript of the remarks **then-Sen. Barack Obama delivered in Chicago on Oct. 2 2002. In his speech Obama said that what he was opposed to was ""a dumb war ... a rash war."" He said the war was a ""cynical attempt"" to shove ""ideological agendas down our throats"" and would distract from domestic problems such as poverty and health care.**\s\sThis all sounded nice at the time. The man had a proven track record. \s\sHere's a flashback to ""anti war"" Obama and his speech on Libya BEFORE we overthrew [Gadaffi](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/28/remarks-president-address-nation-libya) \s\s>... Confronted by this brutal repression and a looming humanitarian crisis I ordered warships into the Mediterranean.  European allies declared their willingness to commit resources to stop the killing.  The Libyan opposition and the Arab League appealed to the world to save lives in Libya.  And so at my direction America led an effort with our allies at the United Nations Security Council to pass a historic resolution that authorized a no-fly zone to stop the regime’s attacks from the air **and further authorized all necessary measures to protect the Libyan people.**\s\sPay attention to the wording and rhetoric around authoritarians (aka ""tyrants"" ""dictators"") and the framing of human rights. \sAdd the fact this wasn't an invasion with boots on the ground this was via proxy. \s\s>... **Of course there is no question that Libya -– and the world –- would be better off with Qaddafi out of power.  I along with many other world leaders have embraced that goal and will actively pursue it through non-military means.  But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.**\s\sThis was in March 2011 the same year Libya actually fell. \s\sMonths later in October 2011 Gadaffi was murdered by ""freedom fighters"" and the country fell into anarchy. \s\sYes Obama technically ""denounced regime change"" but did that stop regime change from happening? \s\s>... **But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.**\s\sNope it did not.\s\sSyria and Libya were the two big controversial wars to oppose with respect to US militarism. Saudi and Yemen which is tragic for Yemeni civilians is also a regional war that needs moderation and dialogue between Houthis and Saudis rather than finger-pointing. \s\sThere was a time frame when denouncing the coup attempts in Syria and Venezuela would have been important during the [early Venezuela phase when the attempt looked viable and Sanders failed to do so then](https://www.thenation.com/article/venezuela-trump-right-foreign-politics/)\s\sRo Khanna Tulsi Gabbard and to some extent even Ilhan Omar did so Sanders did not. \s\sIts easy to swoop in for credit after the risks are gone. Anti war people want a candidate who will stop wars right? Doing so requires courage. \s\sTrump himself has stated he doesn't want war with Iran. That's not a controversial position to take. \s\sHell in retrospect its not controversial to condemn reagan era death squads in Latin America. \s\sWhat's controversial is citing those reagan era death squads as part of an argument denouncing reagan era death squad leader Elliot Abrams and denouncing the [""humanitarian aid"" to Venezuela as a lie](https://www.rt.com/usa/452276-bernie-sanders-venezuela-regime-change/) which he again neglected to do. \s\sHypothetically what can people expect Sanders to do if he becomes president and the deep state starts pushing for regime change in like China or Russia. \s\sIf Sanders end up as president and ends up in such a situation if he tolerates and enables such actions is he then going to start repeating old irrelevant bullshit and bragging about how ""I was against the Iraq war""?\s\sAnd will he endorse hypothetical ""aid packages"" to China and Russia to free them from ""authoritarian leadership""?For what ""track record"" you refer to we know Obama took up Wall Street cash to get elected and war profiteering is good for Wall Street.\s\sBut money aside why do you think it is Bernie keeps harping on ""not me us"" and how he needs people to stay engaged even after he's inaugurated?\s\sIt's not only to help drag our reps into getting the agenda accomplished but it's to hold *him* accountable as well.whyd they make him walk tho we need to preserve as much of his energy as we canHe's the kind of guy who thinks better on his feet.\s\sEver notice even at town halls where they have fancy chairs he just WILL NOT stay seated for any length of time? 😆They told him to stand still and he just couldn't help himself. Kinda like how he can't ever sit at those town halls.\s\s(*For real though walking is very good for you and your long term health! Bernie is very smart to walk and ride his bike every day and I have no doubt it is part of why he is able to run circles around every one else.

I'd like to hear what he thinks of that knowing what we know now.Are you referring to Bombing Serbia during the Bosnian Genocide?This cleared up any concerns as I had about his lack of comment on Venezuela .Indeed we need to further starve Venezuelans through sanctions.   That's the right thing to do. /sUm ... he was wrong about the USSR.THAT is what I signed up for. What a rollercoaster of a 24 hours.Every time the centrist dems have moved more to the center the republicans have moved to the right.  That's what got us into this situation.  Stop.I'm pretty tired of hearing ""Democrats need to move further right to appeal to Republicans. Democrats need to compromise more to appeal to Republicans. Democrats need to vote Republican to appeal to Republicans.""Man Republicans sure sound like entitled snowflakes to me!The main argument in the idea you’re trying to convey is that Democrats should move away from topics that are just getting worse and will never breed agreement  like identity politics and gun control because it makes them like sound like insane confused people who want to take away your right to defend yourself and your family. Don’t play ball with PC advocates and non-believers of the first amendments. Focus on your economic policies. Tell people what you’re gonna give instead of take. SELL democratic socialism.

His rhetoric is all aligned against the super-rich who benefit most from this bill. All of the other nicknames for this thing focus too much on who crapped out this turd rather than who it really benefits. I like WealthCare a lot too.

Hillary and Co. were lying about Bernie's plans (remember Chelsea?) and once Clinton stole the nomination she never mentioned single payer once in the GE. \s\sIf Clinton had won she'd be doing fuck all to get single payer and Bernie's job of selling would be that much tougher because the D establishment would be telling him to sit down and shut up. >she'd be doing fuck all to get single payer\s\sYep.

The rally statement video is actually from late 2015.> once Clinton stole the nomination she never mentioned single payer once in the GE. \s\sThere's a reason Clinton never mentioned it in the GE.

Trump showed that a politician only has to be *barely* credible if s/he shows that s/he cares about the concerns of the middle and working classes.\s\sImagine a nominee who has a strong message on jobs and trade without all of Trump's racism sexism homophobia xenophobia and Islamophobia. If only someone like that had been running....> Not only did Sanders debunk the myth that Trump and Republicans constantly feed to their base of supporters that there isn’t enough room in the budget to help those who need it most but he also convinced one coal miner – a man who voted for Trump – that it’s time to make health care in the United States a universal right.[Republican Health Care Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-usmvYOPfco)\s\s* #Don't get sick!\s\s* If you do get sick...\s\s* #DIE QUICKLYWell the dying quickly would technically save a lot of money.I 'member Alan Grayson having that on a sign on the House Floor.

That would have been the ideal sequence of things. He's been doing this his entire career.

From a political perspective this endorsement is great as she has a huge influence. But from a moral perspective I'm ashamed that Bernie's campaign is now going to be associated with her of all people. \s\sMy feelings are very mixed.She admits to having committed crimes earlier in her life.  Since when does the left believe that people cannot change?\s\sAs far as morality she claims to be a Catholic with a very close relationship with God. If you believe her about her crimes do you believe her about that?If people cared about criminals Trump wouldn't be president. This is a great endorsement.[deleted]No such thing as bad press.\s\sI’m not a cardib fan but she has a huge following. Considering the shit storm of a presidency we are currently enduring anything to help Bernie into the light helps. \s\sIt does suck that her being a horrible human being is almost normalized at this point...True but she has influence nonethelessLol she’s an amazing endorsement.  You are out of your mind or a shillYour mom had you but I still want her to vote for Bernie.Fuck cardi b. Can we please not post her shit in here? She’s a piece of shit.expand plshmmm\s\sThis is questionable support.It really is I mean she literally admitted drugging and robbing guys!Fuck Cardi B she has literally admitted she drugged and robbed a bunch of guys in her youth.Sure but that's not the point here is itAnd that’s worse than all the other rappers who talk about robbing people?Isn’t it UMAN rights?Dick_Slapper_1 = 11 month old account posts in /neoliberal zero karma.\s\sNice.Obama would only be A New Hope if we all understood that he ended up being in league with the Emperor. Well he did sign into law the Orwellian ""Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act"" just the other day. He's created a nice chest of tools to hand over to Trump. 😂😂😂😂😂 no.Pay for what?Go get 'em Bernie.  We're with you.Go Bernie!  Nice physical therapy exercise!Surprise! Surprise! Tom Perez is the ultimate tool. And probably the leading choice for the DNC tools.\s\sMay as well be the ""DollaDollaBillsYo"" party if they pick him.It doesn't. Bailouts like these ones just make things worse and kick the can down the road. The bailouts from the 2008 financial crisis are part of the major problems we are having today. And we again are opting to kick the can further down the road.  \s\s\sEnd the FEDI thought I watched the news pretty closely but I somehow missed the U.S. switching to a socialist state? Workers own the means of production now? Damn am I behind the times.Yes you missed when the workers gave millions of dollars to help the industry where they work continue to exists very much a socialist move and then immediately got notified that they have no ownership over what they paid for. Is the part of socialism where workers made decisions through their representatives on the direction of the industry as if they owned the means of productions but then immediately are told they don't own sh\*t and back to business as usual.Socialism WORKS!@ Just ask the cuckcunts who got 3b from the govt ***during a pandemic!!!!***if you think you want socialistism just look at VuvuzelaFound the right wing NPCFor anyone curious:\s\s>The vuvuzela /vuːvuːˈzɛlə/ is a plastic horn about 65 centimetres (2 ft) long which produces a loud monotone note typically around B♭ 3[2] (the B♭ below middle C).\s\sI remain unconvinced.can I be the next CIA coup??This is how you do it.

Lower margin of error on this one too.Bloomberg must be in negotiations to purchase more polling companiesTHE FACT THAT HE'S AT 18% ANYWHERE is concerning and he'll never take the debate stageGuys we're facing a huge uphill battle here. Bernie has to this point not polled well in most of the super tuesday states (I might remind you) and with so many others in the race Bernie is looking at an uncertain future after super tuesday where it's possible he wins many of the primaries but by too little to matter. We don't need Bernie 2% wins in these states - that is a one way ticket to brokered convention. WE need Bernie to win by 20% in these primaries and take the lions share. National Polls don't matter.\s\sJust want to put it out there that the 2 early wins really don't mean much - assume we are starting over completely in NV especially since Bernie actually trails by 2 in national delegate count.\s\sIf everyone on this sub made calls for 20 minutes today we would absolutely CRUSH Nevada.

Russia didn’t win the election for Trump. There is not a single piece of evidence that proves Vladimir Putin though I’m sure he would if he could altered changed swapped etc. a single vote in this country. This is a partisan-driven fantasy and a conspiracy theory. You have a far better case blaming the media for its incessant coverage of Trump during the GOP primaries which I’m sure delighted you.\s\sNor did Comey lose you the election. It’s not Comey’s fault that you set up a secret server to circumvent transparency — likely to hide favor-trading that you were engaging in for your foundation. It was you who then sent unsecured classified documents through that server although you have constantly bragged about your long experience on these matters. It was your staff that was responsible for attempts to destroy all the evidence related to that server. It was your staff that had “cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery.” And it was your top aide who failed to inform the FBI about classified emails on her computer that she did not hand over when she should have.\s\sAll these things would have landed most people in hot water so you should probably be thankful you escaped with nothing more than a lost election.\s\sThat’s what happened.\s\sDavid Harsanyi\sThe Federalist\sHer turn though. > What happen?

Anyone not being paid knows that there are very few actual progressive Democrats who actually try and put forth progressive actions.The Democratic Party is very content to be the party of moderate Republicans and its leadership actually believes that centrist Democrats + moderate Republicans is a winning formula.  \s\sThe problem with that is that the policy positions of such a conglomerate don't represent Bernie's constituency -- young educated and financially struggling millennials and working class people of all ages races nationalities etc. -- and right along with the middle class the middle ground the Democratic Party seeks to stake out is rapidly disappearing as people seeking representation are essentially being forced to move farther to the left or farther to the right.  \s\sI have no doubt that Berniecrats will eventually encroach into the Democratic Party but the steadfast determinedness of Clinton Democrats to happily hold onto their obliviousness along with those first class tickets on the Titanic to paraphrase Bernie doesn't even bode well for positive midterms.  > that middle ground is rapidly disappearing as people seeking representation are essentially being forced to move farther to the left or farther to the right. \s\sBingo!Another distinct possibility is that the Republican and Democratic parties will cannibalize each other leaving an opening for a new progressive party to its left.>**What you have then is a party at odds with itself.**Its most prominent voices (Sanders and Massachusetts Sen.

Here's his response:\s\s>>**You’re asking a good question and I can’t give you a definitive answer. Certainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have first-class seats.**\s\s>That's *remarkable*. Not only did Sanders run for president in 2016 — and win almost two dozen states! — but he also is now a member of the Democratic Senate leadership thanks to Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer. And when asked one of the simplest questions in all of politics — what does your party stand for — he admits he can't really answer it.\s\s>Part of that is simply for effect. Of course Sanders can offer his own vision — a liberal one — of what the Democratic Party stands for and where it needs to go. He chooses not to because he views the party as still too in thrall of the power brokers donors and consultant class and not committed enough to real change. By saying you don't really know what the party stands for you are making sure people know you're not happy.\s\s>If you need to understand the roots of Sanders's annoyance **look no further than the just-concluded Democratic National Committee chairman's race**......................................Uh chris.  Sanders is a *democratic socialist*.  Democrats are the ones who are supposed to be liberal.\s\sSo if it takes a democratic socialist to 'offer a liberal vision of the democratic party' then what actually are today's democrats?\s\sI'll give you some time to think about it.>The problem will come in 2020 when it seems near certain that the Democratic primary process will force candidates not simply to slam Trump but also to offer their own positive vision for how they might govern if elected. \s\sI'm guessing that the establishment Democratic candidate will do a lot of Trump bashing and differentiating themselves from Trump with a smidgeon of ""my policies are"" on the side.[deleted]Election fraud (like in New York and California) is basically like child molestation.

An honest person would CRUSH the liar in chief. Cheers mate!HELLO SOMEBODY!! These dipshits sink anymore and Bernie's gonna have cali all too himself. Keep calling keep knocking keep texting and keep donating!!!Please keep in mind Clinton/Obama ally Alex Padilla is the CA Secretary of State. Last time voters were given incorrect dates for mail-in ballots and poll workers were instructed to give the wrong ballots to Independents.Bernie leads among all people of Working age.\s\sWe have to make sure that the retired people also get the strong message that they their children and grandchildren will benefit much more under Bernie than the others.Medicare for All makes significant improvements to existing Medicare. Pass it on!The pack is flirting with non viability all over the place. Holy smokes!The establishment isn't nearly as smart as many people assume they are - based on how well they hold power. Still there's no way they could have forgotten the 2016 Republican primary already.Sanders is +4% Biden is -4% Warren is -7% and Buttigeig is -4% since their last poll in in early December. Other than Sanders the biggest gain has been undecided (aka decided by Iowa's & New Hampshire's and Nevada's results).I gotta say the fact that Warren's collapse is so dramatic is pretty heartening. To me this either means:\s\sa) Her Walkback from M4A was much more of a deal than I thought (meaning it has tons of support)\s\sb) Her attack on Sanders backfired more dramatically than I thought (Meaning a LOT of people chose our side of that)\s\sc) Lots of people were 'waiting for permission' to support Bernie (maybe seeing her as 'safer')Holy shit he's close to taking all of the delegates in CALIFORNIA! Can other candidates even recover if that were to happen?lol. CA has 494 delegates. He only needs 1990. No one not viable in CA has any chance at all. In our wildest dreams we couldn't hope for that to happen.\s\sI can dream wild tho.Early voting in CA starts the same day as Iowa. From CBS News:\s\s>About 15 million ballots will be sent out to voters in California on February 3 the same day as the Iowa caucuses. Voters can request a mail-in ballot to fill out at home drop off at a county ballot box or at a voting center.\s\s\s\sWith early state wins (IA NH NV) Bernie will get a huge momentum boost.  These new poll results  while great  may be underestimating Bernie's numbers.Not good enough. He needs to be at 40% to have a solid footing.Both Biden and Warren will go down more if Bernie wins IA and NHThe corporate dems can't stop Bernie's people power tsunami!I’m starting to get more and more worried about Warren giving all her delegates to joe Biden and combining forces to beat out Bernie. Our margin needs to be even bigger! Don’t stop guys the battle is not over.

Kennedy sought real change. They wont shoot him they will use drugs to induce a heart attack. \s\sWe need real revolution from the progressive and independent base.The same polls that said Hillary was a landslide? How many people actually take polls anyway?He IS the most electable candidate. Nobody else comes close.Oh I absolutely agree!Frankly Bernie is the only candidate that seems presidential. Of course he's going to win.And that was so evident at the last so called debate. No one else had his gravitas!He is literally the only one that can beat Trump out of 20 candidates.That's the truth!I totally think he can win. The question is...\s\s1). Will the DNC let him run?\s\sand...\s\s2). [Will the CIA let him live](https://youtu.be/cGujcxfnY2w)?The DNC will do everything in their power to stop him we just have to be more powerful!\s\sAnd he needs to pick a VP that the establishment hates even more than they hate him. Tulsi seems like a good choice but they hate Nina too! Options...At this point letting him do his thing is about the only option the DNC/GOP Billionaire class and War machine have left.  One way or another *we* are going to keep escalating this movement and we're not going to stop even when we do have *our* people in office.  The smart thing to do would be to pacify us with enough of the things we are demanding before we turn this revolution into a revolt.Not ""may be the most electable"" ""IS the most electable!""I completely agree!I think one concept that we should start talking about more is that Bernie’s momentum from last year makes him the only real shot at beating trump in the end. People will be shifty about Warren just like Clinton Trump will have his crowd of psychos forever and he will win. \s\sUnless we go with the actual grassroots for the people Bernie who can garnish votes from all different races places and other designations.Electability needs to mean ""how much are you fighting for the common people"" instead of ""how centrist a politician is"">instead of ""~~how centrist a politician~~ is""\s\sinstead of how much money they are raising from Billionaires and Wall Street!\s\s&#x200B;\s\sFTFYThat it really should! It's what it should be all about!I voted for him in 2016 in Central Ohio and I might do it again.Hope so:) It would be a good choice!Much to my surprise this positive headline showed up in my GoogleNews aggregator page for Bernie Sanders. A lot of people just browse headlines but here's the conclusion from the article:\s\s>Whether you want Bernie Sanders to be president is of course up to you.  But the argument that he simply isn't electable doesn't hold water.  Those who favor other candidates would do better by arguing for them on  their merits instead of relying on the flawed narrative that Sanders  can't possibly win.Bloomberg. Jesus Christ. DNC gonna fuck it up again.They're gonna try but we're watching and not having it this time! There is so much energy everywhere I go I know a lot of us have experienced it. People want Bernie and we are on the watch.I just saw with Emerson polling that Bernie supporters are the most committed and the least likely to vote for the nominee if it's NOT Bernie. So all of those who want anyone but Trump should get on the Bernie train.I agree. My dad actually told me that Id be ""wasting a vote"" by voting for him. He is the one candidate who has the interests of all of us in mind.“Electability” has always been code for “centrist”  by news agencies. They judge candidates by how many niches they can fill at once not realizing that only a single goal can bring people together.And they fool people with the term into thinking it means something else.\s\sThat's why I was so delighted to see this headline. And I hadn't even signed in to my google account so none of my ""give me good news about Bernie"" preferences pushed this story to me it was just on the front page of the aggregator.\s\sI surely hope it's a good sign!Bernie might be extreeeeemely popular but what of the party he associates himself with?But as you know BNMW types will remind us that he's *not really a Democrat* which actually adds to his appeal:)It's funny that they think someone like Hillary or Biden have the greatest chance of winning over disaffected republicans. I think this isn't true at all. Bernie IS the most trustworthy by far. That will mean a lot for disaffected Trump voters who are tired of the lies.No i think they know. They're just gaslighting everyone they possibly can. Just like they omit Yang and Tulsi from everything they possibly can and how they omitted Bernie from everything they could last election but now he's a force to be reckoned with and they're shitting their pants. I mean two billionaires recently joined the race in a super late start because of how well he's been doing. \s\sThey're wealthy assholes who would rather Trump (who's part of the 'anyone but bernie' checklist) be president than Bernie. Because God forbid they rich have to pay a few pennies more in taxes to help pay for road repairs healthcare and college.He is the most electable but the DNC does not care about that.  They would rather lose to Tump.  But Sanders would be invincible as the DNC candidate.  He would get all the DNC loyalists (who would vote for anyone the DNC names) and he would get all the independents who are disgusted with Trump and all the Republicans who are also disgusted with Trump. And he would get all the socialists who might not otherwise even vote. The only people to vote against him would be the die hard Trump loyalists who are not going to vote against Trump no matter what anyway.\s\sIf the DNC actually wants to win they would put Sanders on the ballot.Just like I do EVERY damn time. Just about.Oddly enough he was born the same day as my late father and his late twin sister.Sounds like a sign:) There are lots of reasons to vote for Bernie!$$$ talks.. and who owns the press and who controls the polls draws the state lines and tries to own your mind. But they cant control people from voting for Bernie. While life in this country still can they'll figure out the other candidates are empty suits and Warren is a Bernie copycat that realized a chance to win is to follow the train thats popular. Ya cant hate her too much cause she has valid points. But Biden is like a bag of Obama if you added old water and diluted it. Man thinks its his turn and that being a Senator since Nixon is his easy ride. Mans mistaken his views are not popular and he carried a history  of trash behind him relating to racism corruption and lies. We're not going to fall for another Clintonesque candidate who is backed by a corporate entourage and armored cars full of rip off money. Joe needs to find a good retirement home to live at and care about his own family.. bc he is done trying to convince ordinary people that he gives a crap about them.Yes there are.\sI'll leave this. \s\s\shttps://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/17/maybe-rich-liberals-dont-hate-sanders-because-they-fear-he-cant-win-because-theyre""Voting 3rd party is throwing away your vote"" -MSM\s\sBernie:  Runs as a Democrat...\s\sMSM: Announces poll numbers that exclude Bernie Sanders...\s\sPeople will literally vote for whoever's winning and they know this.  It's why they removed him in 2016.the people saying he can't win are fucking trollingIn the Democratic field I would vote for Bernie or Tulsi.  That’s it.  It is not negotiable.  If the DNC wants my vote in the general I need one of those two.  I cannot be insulted shamed or gaslighted into voting for Pete or Joe or Lizzy.  Period.And then regardless of who the nominee is I’ll cancel out my mom’s vote for Trump.As an Independent who voted for him in 2016 **he can't win UNLESS the DNC wills it you have to question whether Bernie is the same candidate you liked from 2016.**\s\sFirst off he ""lost"" vs Hillary in a two person (3! O'Malley!) race. Hillary was the most unlikable candidate imaginable: under FBI investigation [openly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slu4WdZKq0A) [pay-to-play with Wall Street banks](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927) had a disastrous regime change foreign policy[ couldn't fill](https://twitter.com/NubianAwakening/status/783060190895702016) a [gym rally](https://youtu.be/yJNDTAo1PkQ) and basically a straight-up liar telling people better healthcare wasn't possible told fictitious stories about '[coming under sniper fire in Bosnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfaxA9Q-9AQ)' and clearly the MSM's chosen-to-be-coronated Queen. [When you take all this into account](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cajki9/it_is_literally_astonishing_to_me_how_many_people/et9v2w8/) along with leaks within the DNC from Wikileaks the glaring vote count discrepancies purges voter suppression registration 'errors'.. etc the revelations of the DNC Fraud Lawsuit and open admittance from staff within the DNC it is quite clear that the 2016 primaries were rigged. Nearly every Bernie supporter who supported him then at least admits (or has admitted this) and yet we get posts like this and ""Bernie WILL win!"" chants all across Twitter from these same people.  Why?\s\sThe more pressing matters imperiling our country are election integrity and whistle-blowers and publishers being persecuted via the imprisonments of Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning. If our country and [our most popular candidate cannot stand against policing corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQBZQnH49zo) **we are lost as a nation.** **We will not get progressive policy if we can't tackle these issues.** Bernie stumping for Hillary in 2016 has hurt his support for 2020. At least 1/3 of his supporters [who bumped him up to $27](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/18/bernie-sanders-keeps-saying-his-average-donation-is-27-but-it-really-isnt/) on average in small donations in 2016 won't give $ or vote for him this cycle [with that now being $19](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/10/01/fueled-teachers-and-average-donation-18-sanders-raised-record-253-million-third). As I type this many of these receipts are becoming harder and harder to provide due to the Orwellian censorship measures of the surveillance machine [our social media which is heavily influenced/controlled by our intel agencies](https://imgur.com/a/TXKr6Xm). These machinations are in place and are the locks on the barriers to our Democracy. Our REAL Democracy (not the fake one we are voting in). **Ignoring these issues isn't doing a service to our country or your candidate. In fact it is harming them. We must pressure ALL our candidates to tackle curbing the social media/intelligence agency empire holding our government accountable for persecuting whistle-blowers and publishers.** \s\sI see many Bernie supporters insulting Tulsi supporters and their candidate while failing to acknowledge any of this. Many Tulsi supporters are Bernie or Busters from 2016. They are your allies vs corruption NOT Warren supporters or TYT or most 'progressive' news shows that seem to be buddying-up to TYT (Seder Pakman Brooks Tim Black Kulinski Humanist Report). I'd disagree with you on the 'most electable candidate part' but that bears no relevance with regards to all the things I outlined above. I'm not here to cheer lead for X candidate. Point is Tulsi & her supporters are your allies vs corruption not these people or Warren supporters. Those people are there to divide your movement and make you think voting works in a system controlled by bankers and intelligence agencies (remember JFK?..)  It is up to us to change the system and not by voting.  I hope you all are ready to get on your Yellow Vests and bring your guillotines to march because that is what it will take to change this system. We have over 100 years of corruption in our history as proof (JFK and the Unspeakable by James W. Douglass The Devil's Chessboard - by David Talbot.. Secrets of the Federal Reserve - By Eustace Mullins.. ) \s\shttps://twitter.com/1vs5i\s\shttps://twitter.com/action_4assange\s\s... As you were.Bernie can’t win.u/susanj2019 I did post that and I’ll stand by it. Because I think for a majority of America it would work I really do. It’s an idealist way of thinking sure. But that’s not quite the topic we were discussing here you want to discuss it more DM me and we can have a conversation instead of battling back and forth here for karma that I will undoubtedly lose.\s\sYou can continue to accuse me of being a troll and thats fine you have that right as I also have the right to question issues I have about Bernie. Those concerns being his age and health. And in that post you’re exactly the type of person I figure would being trying to pick every bit of every comment I made apart or claiming I’m a troll or what ever. That at least to me is what a “Bernie bro” is. How dare I or anyone raise any sort of concern. Look I’m not trying to cultivate any possible voters for any other candidates here. It’s reddit for fucks sake not the DNC headquarters. I’m posting my opinion on an article that was posted an I saw on my feed. Which last I check is completely a valid thing to do. And I happen I have contrasting ideas with what appears to be a majority of people on this sub and if anything that should be good. If you don’t have people challenging your ideas and all you have is an echo chamber you’ll never grow. So to the hand full of people who have responded to me with insightful information thanks. Can recall name otherwise I’d give credit. \s\sBut look dude if you’re just going to call people a troll for challenging your ideas you’re no better than Cheeto in charge getting all pissy and calling “fake news” because their narrative doesn’t paint you in a good light. \s\s\sSeriously tho if you want to talk about that previous post I’m game for days was thinking about it on my drive home from early thanksgiving today. Cheers homie hope you sleep well.Dude I was upvoting you and willing to engage until I realized that I was being taken by a concern troll. I don't care for that much.\s\sAnd your ""bernie-bro"" comment shows really bad faith. You can't come here saying you like Bernie but have ""concerns"" and be taken seriously.\s\sArgue in good faith don't try to bullshit us. It's a sneaky Pete kind of thing to do (and yes that's another reason people really hate him he's a liar.)\s\sI sleep very well. And I hope you will too under a Sanders administration where I suspect your real concerns will be taken care of. You might be a young person scared about the future climate change health care etc. Though I have no proof of that at all.He can't win.He’s the ONLY one who can winHe's already winning.I really dig the dude I voted for him in 2016 and I still feel for the most part the same; however the realist in me and working in the medical field have me\sEXTREMELY skeptical of having him become president. Yes this is an age thing and yes this is about the fact that he just had a damn heart attack. If he was 20 years younger you can bet your ass I’d be 100% in on Bernie but the fact that he is literally the age of the typical life expectancy of the average US citizen has to mean something. He’s not a goddamn superhero he’s a regular ass dude which I feel like is part of what makes him so likable but I feel like ignoring his age is just blind ignorance. I just wish the dude could have made it in sooner or found a fountain of youth. At this point I think he best chance would be getting a VP candidate that’s much younger than him. \s\sThat being said trump is virtually the same age so in a head to head match up man I hope America can see the light that is Bernie.Seems like a silly ass reason I’m grand scheme of things does it not? We’re talking about ending medical emergencies making you bankrupt. We’re talking ending the prison profiteering and releasing nonviolent offenders from jail. And taking on the corrupt pharmaceutical companies that profit off our sickness. We’re talking ending the bullshit lobbying bribery nonsense that our political state is in right now. I could keep going. \s\s\sI’m sorry but age just seems too trivial a thing to even worry about with the stakes that high but even considering that Bernie’s mental health is still crazy good man is sharp and quick witted and he still traveling all around the country doing rallies and all his other stuff. He’s younger physically and mentally than some 50 year olds. Old people have heart problems. He will be fine. \s\s\sAnd even if everything I just said doesn’t matter I’ll take whoever Bernie picks as Vice President over Warren Trump and Biden anyday.People thankfully are individuals so what’s typical for an age may not apply at all to an individual. The typical American is overweight but not everyone is. Etc etc etcBernie has said that he wants a younger VP. Tulsi or Nina would fit the bill! \s\sNancy Pelosi is older than Bernie. And Ruth Bader Ginsberg is a couple of years older than Bernie would be after one term. It doesn't seem to be a problem even with RBG's recent health scares.\s\sAnd as you note Trump is in the same age range. And Warren who would be such a sitting target for Trump is close in age too. Quite honestly out of the whole Dem field only Bernie has the fire and the spirit and the fight in him to beat Trump.\s\sIf you don't want Trump give Bernie a chance he really is our best chance!Bernie is as healthy as Trump and more likely to beat Trump than Biden Warren or Buttigieg. \s\sWorst case scenario Bernie excites the base gets sworn in with a Democratic majority in the House and Senate and makes it 1 year. In that year we get the Senate to go nuclear on Medicare for All a pile of executive orders and hopefully another policy or two like Green New Deal. Then let's assume (despite the medical odds) that he does die. We'll then have a progressive Democratic VP move up into the presidency and a country who wants to see his vision carried out. \s\sIn what way would this be worse than 4 years of Trump or a do-nothing Buttigieg administration?i don't see the point in worrying about his age. Let's cross that bridge when we come to it. let's be realistic here. what's the worst that happens if he wins and is adversely affected by his age? ok probably the worst possible thing is he is so riddled with dementia that he becomes a fascist murderer or something but come on. Senile people don't become the exact opposite of everything they used to be.\s\sso probably the worst outcome possible is that the he dies of old age. sad of course quite devastating on a human level really but practically speaking it...probably wouldn't change very much? i don't know maybe i'm naive but it's not as if a president dies and their most bitter enemy gets to take their spot. ""Oh shit Bernie died. Well now we have to make Mitch McConnell or Lindsey Graham the president!"" It's just not how it would go down.\s\sOn the contrary we trust his leadership we have to trust that he will put people in place throughout his administration specifically in the VP spot that would steadfastly carry on his legacy and adhere to his principles. It's also not as if should he die suddenly everyone goes ""Well democratic socialism sure is bullshit!"" Again if nothing else it would probably be helpful just in terms of bringing silly casuals into the fold who feel bad and thought he was so sweet and funny or whatever.\s\sagain i just don't see the point in this kind of worrying. the only likely choices are all in their 70s so you gotta choose one.>There were zero Sanders Progressive wing representatives elected in the Democratic Party. The Chair two Vice Chairs Chair Of CEVP were all part of the Obama administration. The Secretary and Finance Chair were Obama or Hillary Delegates or Superdelegate. The third Vice Chair was re-elected for her post served during the Debbie Wasserman Schultz led Democratic Party. The Treasurer may be worst of all overtly and frankly an investment banker.\s\s>A recent Gallup poll shows that 28% of Americans consider themselves Republicans and only 25% consider themselves Democrats. A whopping 44% of Americans consider themselves independent.\s\s>Is this really how the Democratic Party wants to move forward and try to win elections?\s\s>Democrats will not win elections by electing investment bankers superdelegates and former Obama administration establishment officials to their posts. The Democrats will continue to lose elections because of their centrist and corporate donation-friendly mentality.Sounds like Bernie supporters should form/join a new political party.That the party of identity politics also failed to elect a single white woman is also telling . . .

For what? \s\sHe is gearing up for donations to the Obama Presidential Library.

The Sanders Revolution.#now we will elect ZERO from THEIRS>$32 trillion. You may have seen this number in corporate media coverage and Republican propaganda. It’s the estimated cost of universal health care over a 10-year period. \s\s>It’s a big number—a big scary number. So hacks like the editorial board at The Washington Post use it to scare people with titles like “Single-payer health care would have an astonishingly high price tag.” \s\s>Not just high—astonishingly high. \s\s>Of course what the editorial board of The Washington Post leaves out (though you think they’d know better) is any comparison to what we’re currently spending. \s\s>Compared to what we’re currently spending universal health care or single-payer health care would save us $17 trillion over 10 years. \s\s>In order to demonstrate this we just need a couple of numbers. The first number is how much we currently spend on health care per year. \s\s>**National Healthcare Expenditure (NHE)**\s\s>This is a number called the National Healthcare Expenditure (NHE). NHE measures everything we spend on health care — both public and private. In 2015 the NHE was $3.2 trillion or $9990 per person per year.\s\s>That $9990 per person makes us the most expensive healthcare system in the world. It was this way before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as well. In 2013 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) calculated the average worldwide healthcare spend per person at $3453. \s\s>Back to our number: $3.2 trillion in 2015. It increased to $3.4 trillion in 2016.  \s\s>**Growth rate**\s\s>As you can see the amount of spending per year doesn’t stay the same. It grows on a yearly basis. So the second number we need is the growth rate. \s\s>According to the study titled “National Healthcare Expenditures 2016-2025: Price Increases Aging Push Sector to 20 Percent of Economy” health care costs in the United States are estimated to grow at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent from 2016 to 2025. \s\s>If we apply this growth rate over 10 years and add up the costs our current healthcare system will cost $49 trillion. \s\s>**Savings**\s\s>$49 trillion (current system) — $32 trillion (single payer) = $17 trillion in savings. \s\s>Over a 10-year period universal health care or a single-payer system would save $17 trillion. \s\s>Yes you read that right … universal health care would cost $17 trillion less over 10 years. A universal health care system would save us $1.7 trillion a year. And *a lot* of lives. Here's a summary of [one tiny state that actually did it](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25519-hundreds-of-lives-saved-by-universal-healthcare-in-us/). The author of the article David Akadjian has a book ""The Little Book of Revolution A Distributive Strategy for Democracy"".  Here's the interesting discussion: http://akadjian.com.\s\s>“If you want to build a big movement pick a big fight.” – Derek CressmanPerhaps the wonkiest of all the DKos front pagers. And I mean that in a good way.The original link is to DK - https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/7/23/1682312/-Universal-health-care-would-save-17-trillionThank you for the archived link in the headline. I clicked through without checking the source first.The more I think about it the more I think the establishment is built to keep people poor. >What’s the problem then? \s\s>The problem is that certain industries have very powerful lobbies. And these industries spend a lot of money on advertising to make sure that additional $17 trillion goes to them. \s\s>The corporate special interest group Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEE) a group that helped make Milton Friedman a name people recognize used the exact same numbers we’ve been discussing to write “Bernie-Care Would Cost $32 Trillion Twice What Sanders Claimed.” \s\s>You’re not going to believe this but nowhere in the article do they mention that it would also save us $17 trillion over our current system. Instead they focus on how federal spending would increase.\s\s..............................................\s\s>You know why federal spending would increase? Because we wouldn’t be paying for insurance out of our own pockets. The reason for the increase is simply that private spending moves to public spending. As illustrated in the excerpt from the Urban Institute’s analysis of universal health care roughly $22 trillion of private spending on health care moves to public spending. Overall however we’d spend $17 trillion less over 10 years and we could insure everyone. \s\s>The next time someone tells you we need to reform health care show them how we could easily save $17 trillion if we just did what every other developed country in the world does when it comes to health care.  Elites using their institutional advantage to maintain their position and set the people they define as inferior at each other's throats is older than this country. \s\sIf you haven't yet read Howard Zinn's ""[A People's History of the United States](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-otanUZGGGcnDgfr7)."" (Not e-reader friendly except maybe epub format but I'm not familiar with that. Probably available at/through your local library.)  \s\sIn Chapter 2 ""The Color Line"" Zinn writes  \s>Only one fear was greater than the fear of black rebellion in the new American colonies. That was **the fear that discontented whites would join black slaves to overthrow the existing order**. In the early years of slavery especially before racism as a way of thinking was firmly ingrained while white indentured servants were often treated as badly as black slaves there was a possibility of cooperation. As Edmund Morgan sees it:  \s>\s>>There are hints that the two despised groups initially saw each other as sharing the same predicament. It was common for example for servants and slaves to run away together steal hogs together get drunk together. It was not uncommon for them to make love together. In Bacon's Rebellion one of the last groups to surrender was a mixed band of eighty negroes and twenty English servants.  \s>  \s>As Morgan says masters ""initially at least perceived slaves in much the same way they had always perceived servants... shiftless irresponsible unfaithful ungrateful dishonest...."" And ""if freemen with disappointed hopes should make common cause with slaves of desperate hope the results might be worse than anything Bacon had done.""  \s>  \s>And so measures were taken. About the same time that slave codes involving discipline and punishment were passed by the Virginia Assembly Virginia's ruling class having proclaimed that all white men were superior to black went on to offer their social (but white) inferiors a number of benefits previously denied them. In 1705 a law was passed requiring masters to provide white servants whose indenture time was up with ten bushels of corn thirty shillings and a gun while women servants were to get 15 bushels of corn and forty shillings. Also the newly freed servants were to get 50 acres of land.  \s>  \s>Morgan concludes: ""Once the small planter felt less exploited by taxation and began to prosper a little he became less turbulent less dangerous more respectable. He could begin to see his big neighbor not as an extortionist but as a powerful protector of their common interests.""  \s>  \s>We see now a complex web of historical threads to ensnare blacks for slavery in America: the desperation of starving settlers the special helplessness of the displaced African the powerful incentive of profit for slave trader and planter the temptation of superior status for poor whites the elaborate controls against escape and rebellion the legal and social punishment of black and white collaboration. \s>  \s>The point is that the elements of this web are historical not ""natural."" This does not mean that they are easily disentangled dismantled. It means only that there is a possibility for something else under historical conditions not yet realized. **And one of these conditions would be the elimination of that class exploitation which has made poor whites desperate for small gifts of status and has prevented that unity of black and white necessary for joint rebellion and reconstruction.**   \s  \sUndoubtably.[removed]Thank you for the archived link.

I bet Bernie Sanders is really steamed he didn't see this coming.Here's another poll:\s\s[Ryan Struyk on Twitter: Brace yourselves: New 2020 numbers out of New Hampshire via UNH](https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/920741254543151109) -->\s\s**Sanders 31%**\sBiden 24%\sWarren 13%\sBooker 6%\sO'Malley 3%\sHickenlooper 2%\sZuckerberg 2%\sHarris 1%\sRyan 1%\sKlobuchar 1%\sGillibrand 1%\sDelaney 0This is oldBut good.>On top of this it is worth noting that the sample of Democratic primary voters is small (356) meaning that the margin of error is relatively high. Still it suggests that progressives such as Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are making some headway. The 2020 Democratic primary is the left of the party’s to lose.\s\sA) 2 of those 3 aren't progressive.\s\sB) Harris didn't score high enough for her % to be listed (you have to click the link to the poll & its 6%)).  So I'm not sure how much ""headway"" she's making.  With Hillary's donors yes.  Voters remains to be seen.Why is HRC not on the poll?[deleted]I'd rather see someone with integrity like Bernie Sanders go up against Trump for obvious reasons.I think the ""obvious reason"" is that he wants Trump to win.  Because per these [polls](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html) #BernieWouldHaveWon> obvious reasons.\s\sNot obvious to me.  What's so great about Joe?> for obvious reasons.\s\sNothing obvious comes to mind for me.Just check out the ""creepy Joe Biden"" videos on YouTube and you will see why Joe would be absolutely creamed by Republicans independents and most Democrats...I seem to recall Biden being caught with plagerizing. That kind be of dishonest stuff will get a student expelled from university. \s\sI'd rather an FDR democrat over a Third Way for obvious reasons... Third Way keeps losing us seats!A [new contender](https://np.reddit.com/user/JabbatheHaute) has [entered the ring](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/771m8l/sanders_diplomacy_human_rights_must_drive_us/doid2te/).Not with him being videotaped acting strangely with female children and hanging out with ISIS leaders. Especially not now with female assaulters in the public eye finally being taken down.So you want Trump to win again?[deleted][deleted]Theory:  \s\sI am 100% billionaires being in elected office so please nobody construe this as me suggesting Marc Zuckerburg would be a good candidate but it just occurred to me that they are going at him pretty hard for this ""Russian Ads on Facebook"" bullshit and he was also considering a run for President.  There's really NOTHING to this facebook russian ad thing.  2.3 million dollars were spent on facebook ads?!?!  That's gotta be less than 1/2 a percent of what is spent on facebook ads in a fucking day or something absurd.  2.3 million dollars is literally what falls out of George Soros's pocket when he takes off his pants at the end of the day.  It's chump change.  Yet they are pretending like this was a HUGE deal.  \s\sAre we already witnessing attempts by the Establishment to clear the field for 2016 in preparation for what will most certainly be a Harris vs Biden primary?  Zuckerberg is a hillbot.  This is probably the part he is playing in Hillary's Russian conspiracy theory.I don't disagree with Bernie but with all that has happened he now feels like an after thought.  He could have risen to the occasion and been a strong voice of moral authority in these uncertain and turbulent times but he ceded to Biden and the Democratic Establishment who are even further behind as to be irrelevant.Unfortunately on point. 2020 was basically a gift to Bernie and his policies. The greatest argument for what he offered. He had an army that likely rivaled 2008 Obama's. He squandered it. He didn't need to sling shit but he needed to call out the BS when it happened.\s\sHe has the vision but lacks the fire and conviction he needed. He should've never praised Biden throughout the campaign. He should never have ran with the dems again. \s\sI've said it before and I'll keep saying it. I hope Nina Turner and others like her are making moves for 2024. Bernie started this but he's not the one that gets us over the finish line.Yep. Bernie gave up on US.\s\sI still believe everything I did six months ago just without the disillusionment that Bernie was going to fight for us. I love the movement but mourn for Bernie.Well to offer something concrete when the CARES Act passed the Senate was passing everything by unanimous consent. It only took a senator (any senator) to interrupt the process. \s\sFor instance this is what Rand Paul did in objection to the unanimous consent that NATO expand to include Montenegro [for which Famous Bipartisan Statesman John McCain accused him of being a Russian dupe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpzfGr_Dzqg)\s\sWise? I can see people objecting to it. But there is often ways to stop seemingly unstoppable machines and when these people were looting the wealth of the country it would have been a point where Bernie could have as someone said above used leverage to shove a couple of these things in there.It’s one thing to say that but we don’t know his exact motives for dropping out.  The main thing to keep in mind too is all the shit that was going on around that time too with Covid kicking off and the mounting evidence of another fraudulent primary there are a lot of angles to consider.People keep saying Bernie should have fought back more called out the DNC's BS more etc. Would that have actually mattered though? The DNC were clearly willing to do whatever corrupt shit they needed to in order to ensure he wouldn't win. Maybe it still would have mattered though I guess none of us knows. Perhaps one of his reasons was that he felt partially responsible for Hillary's loss in 2016 by dividing the democratic party so much so this time he wanted to try and reunite the party behind who he (wrongly) perceived to be the most likely candidate to beat Trump. (but it's not like he could have endorsed anyone other than the DNC's smoke-filled-room pick without once again furthering the divide of the party)\s\sI guess he just really believes that the Democratic party can be reformed. I wish he would reject the Democratic party and join the People's Party. Any ideas why he hasn't done that yet?Not too little (there can always be more) but sure feels like too late.And I'm sure neolibs will somehow find a way to hate these ideas.They probably already do. After all they always say “where’s the money?” when they’re wasting hundreds of billions on our military.This is the way.[deleted]Check the use of plastic bullets and baton rounds in Norther Ireland during the troubles they cant be used safely. Even when fired into the ground they've injured maimed and killed.Bernie says this shit but then he endorses Biden? GTFOIt's not entirely unreasonable that he did as Trump is a literal nightmare. Bernie is playing what's likely to win *now*. That said I'm still not voting for Biden.But Where would he get all the monney? Tax the filthy rich? Thats not fair :(> Thats not fair\s\sWhy is that?America doesn't deserve a leader like Bernie. But the country needs him now more than ever.He's the reverse Batman he's the hero we need not the one we deserve.There will be more like him. Millennials and GenZ are getting pretty politically active.Easy stop handing it to corporations and almost no one has 15 kids (specially all under 18) so thats a strawmanHow can I know its a thoughtless question? I'm trying to figure out how this works only ask educated questions on a subject I know? Trying to figure this out so I asked.All great ideas but somehow he can't convince the voters he needs the most that HE can get it done.Thank you all for trying to help spread some knowledge my way!Where would all this money come from?Where did the $5T they just printed for the banks come from? They made it out of thin air.Really?Did he say “vote for Joe Biden” before the mic drop?Then why is he supporting the guy that's opposed to all of this?I'd be happier to read this if Bernie hadn't capitulated to Biden and the corporate Dems effectively giving up all his leverage. I loved his campaign but now he just feels like all bark and no bite.He would be leading in delegates HANDS DOWNI agree but to an extent. I think him suspending his campaing has more to do with Covid-19 than it did win how he did on Super Tuesday. In re to influence. He fought to stay on the ballot and asked his supporters to keep voting for him in the remaining primary states so that he could amass  more delegates to use as influence at the convention.TwiceCould you delve into this a little more? It seems like the threat of his campaign reemerging though unfortunately he wouldn't do that would give him at least some leverage. \s\s\sEspecially now that they believe biden is polling ahead of trump (unverified info) Bernie's pretty much the last threat to a democrat victory right?How do we pay for 2k a month for every single person. There is around 320 325 million in the US. Every 3 dollars is a billion almost. Also if someone has 15 kids they get 30k a month?Easy stop handing it to corporations and almost no one has 15 kids (specially all under 18) so thats a strawman\s\sThe current stimulus works out to 33k per person ( this plan is roughly 24k per person  assuming its has to last a whole year which is probably unecessary)  even though a mere 1200 went to us and the rest to the oligarchs\s\sThe people getting this money will spend almost all of  in the economy keeping things going. Money handed directly to corporations is often just passed to stockholders after workers  get laid off anyway  \s\sStimulus money given to the rich just gets dumped in over stuffed bank accounts in  off shore tax haven where it does zilch for our economyYou should think before you speak mateThe same way we pay for everything else: the treasury prints the money Congress appropriates it. The people with money the recirculate it through the economy via consumer spending a portion of which is taxed to mitigate the effects of inflation.Sir you really nailed it on the head. I don't know why I never realized this but I better start pumping out babies. That's a lot of money!!Why include things he knows won't pass?You ever seen Pawn Stars? A tactic of negotiation is to start by asking for much more than you want or less than what you’re willing to pay. In psychology they call it door-in-the-face technique.That's a very dem negotiation technique: give up everything you want before you start. Negotiation by capitulation I call it. That way you will always end up with *even less than that* when you have to ""compromise"" so that you can sit back and complain about how intractable the repubs are...\s\sI think that he ought to ask for some *really* difficult things like maybe getting Mnuchin to release the details of who all that money is going to. Then when he has to compromise he might end up with something useful left...Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you’ll land among the stars.End For Profit Prisons.\s\sEnd asset forfeiture without conviction.I love Bernie.So Bernie is back in Congress?  He last voted in March and missed every vote since.FYI u/clueless_shadow is a shill for the Biden campaign.Uh banning pepper spray is a mistake and an overreaction. That stuff has saved my ass more then once.I think it was banning use of pepper spray by police not sure thoughI'd be in favor of changes if you prefer.  Everytime they use it they have to fill out a discharge report that is very long and details out the scenario.  That report is reviewed by a citizen review board.  If it was unjustly used the officer is punished and the union agreements do not cover this.  If the report is found to be inaccurate the officer is punished or terminated.  If the bodycam was off the review board always finds the officer unjustly used it.Biden just scored a record-breaking +14 poll..\s\sI would normally advise people to vote for a 3rd party but I think we ought to consider voting for Trump at this point not because we like him but because we have a duty to do everything in our power to keep sleepy Joe & the corrupt DNC out of the white house. Biden goes against everything Bernie stands for we just can't risk it.\s\sedit: The Biden Bros are out in force today I see.I can understand ""fuck Joe everyone should vote Green to make a statement."" \s\sBut suggesting a Trump vote is asinine.Bitch who tf calls biden ""sleepy joe"" fuck off he blows but we arent trump supporters. Nice try dipshot frog.You're telling people to vote for the man Bernie said is the biggest threat to America what do you expect?youcantbeserious.gif[deleted]Why would you let trump stay in office 4 more years? Let's restart with a new guy and push for better polices. If we as the people  go full force at joe and tell him to change things and really pressure him he will make some better changes than trump ever will.  Trump proved that he is resistant to any attempt at a progressive idea. He would rather hide in a bunker than fix the problems he has. Trump is a moron and a fuck face we cant control. We can as a massive force control Biden and mold his weak brain in a more left position. We just have to stay vocal hold the fire to his feet.why didn’t he do this when he **still had leverage**Dicky McGeezaks I love you!Bernie Sanders should have been the Democratic nominee.[deleted][deleted]I would be willing to bet that Bernie is currently walking a thin line between having to do partisian hackery in order to keep some people on your side and have some allies in Congress. I would hope that Bernie knows who Schumer really isUs on the reddit floor today -  \s\s\s#so bernie GET BACK IN THE FUCKING RACE THEN!!!! \s\s\sThe dems dont care that you said something in the senate!!!Biden has already passed the delegate threshold. He is the official nominee now.So he got his ass back in there? I'm still salty about that internet privacy bill that failed because he didn't show up.They had Jane.Story?You should be salty at the fuckers who voted for itBernie Sanders based as fuck as always.The ""Tear Gas"" ""Rubber (coated) Bullets"" and ""Pepper Spray"" donors of Joe Biden won't allow that.None of which Pelosi will let happen. Fuck off Bernie it’s all talk.I’m trying to figure out what you think he should do? Is it to introduce legislation that is more passable but not what he thinks is best for the people?Fuck off Blue Dog idiotTear gas is banned from War via the Geneva Convention.  Yet the US is now using it on it's citizens?  Throw these police in the gulag.  This should be a warcrime.Only $2k monthly payments?  Seems low.[deleted]The observance of differential between the disposition of reactionaries and the status quo is the logic behind the support of Biden. Bernie lost an undemocratic primary but Donald Trump and the forces of white supremacy that dominate our power structures must be displaced.Banning tear gas and rubber bullets would just mean they’d have to use regular bullets more police have to protect themselves too.Tear gas is a war crime use rubber bullets correctlyI can't understand why this man didn't get more support. Nothing about it makes sense.Because the American political system is rigged by lobbyists and special interest groups elections are like any other commodity sold to the highest bidder. And the people who would have their wealth redistributed will do anything they can to stop the man trying to redistribute it.[deleted]Neolibs: “But how do you pay for it?”\s\sThat’s their most likely reaction honestlyAlso Neolibs: ""Bail out Wallstreet and big business money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrr.""Brrrrrrrrhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM6wRl7HQ_QHe had all the answers. The answers have always been there. The establishment Dems should be fighting for them too. They aren't and they won't.\s\sNever Biden. Never another establishment Dem.\s\sBernie dropped/was forced out before people could realize that he was the only candidate who would help them. It's almost as if the establishment knew he would beat Trump.You’re assuming still that the establishment doesn’t want Trump as president for a 2nd term.> It's almost as if the establishment knew he would beat Trump.\s\s>and that covid was coming \s\s> and that tara was about to be reported on \s\sAnd hmm.... almost like the new outlets tipped them off on ALL of these!!!!....Did they pass?Imagine a senate without mcconnel and with sanders in that job....Best we got is Charles Booker of Kentucky he's loking to kick out Mitch in November provided he can pull off the primary againt the corporate puppet Amy McGrath.I’m in the wrong timelineIf dems take back the senate and Mitch is kicked off his seat the fact that you’d pick boring/milktoast chuck for majority leader over Bernie says everything about how little they want to do.Ironic.... Commie bernie would have more of a chance in the Republican party than he did in TWO ""democratic"" Primaries....\s\sLet that sink in guys...Damn I wish our nominee thought the same.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president and appear with him at a rally on Saturday according to two people with knowledge of her plans.\s\s>**The surprise endorsement is a political coup for Sanders** 78 who has been fading in the polls and has faced growing questions about his age and health. Before Tuesday’s Democratic debate he had been sidelined from the campaign trail for two weeks by a heart attack.\s\s>**“We’re looking forward to Saturday” said Corbin Trent a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders teased the rally at Tuesday night’s presidential debate saying he would have a “special guest” appearing with him in New York.**\s\s>Another person with knowledge of the congresswoman’s plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a decision that has not yet been announced publicly confirmed the endorsement. Sanders campaign officials declined to comment.\s\s> **The endorsement could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)** who like Sanders is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer. Ocasio-Cortez had worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders’s 2016 presidential bid; she was recruited to run for Congress in 2018 by Justice Democrats a group that grew out of the Sanders campaign.\s> \s> **Few figures hold as much sway in the party’s liberal wing as Ocasio-Cortez whose 2018 primary win over then-Rep.

And now that this info is out there and the fact that the Squad is going to be with Bernie at the rally it's going to drive up interest. I wish I could be in NYC this weekend! That rally is going to be unbelievable.Seriously tho I didn’t consider that the coverage of the rally would be massive if they announced the guests beforehand but yea there’s gonna be a lot more people that show up after this announcement.Ayanna isn’t important?

I don't have time right now.  \sI'll just link these words of mine from a recent post with Krystal Ball's commentary:  \s[""Tonight on October 15 2019 **Bernie's Master Plan for 2020** moves into the next phase.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/di8wnp/krystal_ball_on_sanders_the_gloves_are_finally/f3uh9if/)  \s[""Tonight's debate begins **Bernie's Juggernaut** in earnest.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/di8wnp/krystal_ball_on_sanders_the_gloves_are_finally/f3uh9if/)  \sI had to get those quotes out before the Juggernaut got underway for posterity's sake.  \sI wanted to present these ideas more formally but my writing time is much reduced due to my new work schedule.  \sSo I just shoehorned them into a post with Krystal Ball's on-point commentary.\s\s**AOC is Bernie's Shadow & The Leader of The Squad.**  \sI will explain what this means & more when I formally break down my observations on **Bernie's Master Plan for 2020**.  \sFirst I have to finish telling my [**Political History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/c2ayy1/my_political_history_aka_my_journey_to_the/) so you can have full understanding of my journey to this Revolution.  \sDiscovering this plan gives me so much hope about the future.

Stay tuned everybody.\s\sJohn Lucas> __TIMECUBE__Timing is perfection. Not only does it give Bernie a big post-heart attack boost but all these months AOC has been gaining support of a ton of non-Bernie supporters who may be swayed.\s\sIt’s gold if you’re working that 60+ MSNBC crowd lemme tell ya.FUCK YEA!!!!!!! JUMPED OUT OF MY SEAT AND ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Like finally some great news. I didn’t dare hope to presume this endorsement but I’m so fucking glad. Like I’ve been waiting for this kind of gratification since Warren shafted us in 2016.Dont want to be negative guys but lets hope the squad dont pull  Ro khanna on us. :)The comments on the WaPo article are horrible. I love how these mainstream Dems are flabbergasted by the whole thing. It's delicious:)I’ve been saying for a long time just wait for AOC to obviously endorse sanders and see if these identity politic neo-liberals are still so excited about her. They are gross. What really baffled me was why they liked her in the first place. She does not align with their baffoonery.You wern’t kidding. It’s cancer it’s virtually youtube comments.But surprisingly the comments on r/politics are very positive!What’s the ratio on this postFuck yes.Woo! I never doubted our Queen! Even when the devil tempted her like the lord of Nazareth! Even when they laughed and mocked me for saying that we are against monarchy! Storms rained down votes on to thee! But she was for me the guiding light. For they mocked her as well. The Troll armies marched on this subreddit. Waves upon waves of hatred. Saying that she was a tavern maiden and nothing more. Born without privileges how can she rule? They screamed she dances like a gypsy! She's a heretic! that should burn at the stake! Her own people grew with doubt. ""Would she be brave enough to stand in the fire with the old wise man?"" But my faith never wavered. For it is more than thy faith! It is the actions never words; she has done. Against every onslaught she fought on with dignity. For she was raised by the people for the people. And let me remind thee it was Democracy that anointed her. All hail our Queen! Long live Democracy! Praise be onto AOC![deleted]It's brought you here.You should see the neck breaking mental gymnastics they're doing in the politics sub.I'm actually seeing some self-proclaimed fence sitters over there saying the AOC endorsement has brought them into Bernie's corner.\s\s**edit** - One commenter also said they were for Bernie in 2016 but switched to Warren this year but lately her waffling on both M4A and taking big money have caused them to reconsider. Now with the AOC endorsement and Bernie's great performance tonight they're solidly back on team Bernie.that's where all the liberals convene to accuse anyone who isn't ""with her"" of being a Russian troll[deleted]Don't hate me but I see no sign that Bernie's campaign is paying attention to voter registration and the primaries.\s\sSince the nomination is the real prize in 2020 a real effort is needed to GOTV for primary elections.\s\sA campaign staffer gave a very blasé and muddled answer to the question of what was being done.\s\sNo more donations until they get serious about the primaries. They were weak on this in 2016 too. It makes me skeptical that they plan to go all the way and I don't want my donations ending up with the DNC.Well the campaign is largely staffed by volunteers. I can’t speak much about volunteers elsewhere but at least in NYC they have been doing pretty much daily voter registrations all across the city and had tables and presence at major events like the climate strike: mobilization that I haven’t seen from any other campaign.\s\s\sAlso DSA voted to endorse Bernie several months ago and many chapters are also organizing their membership to canvass for him (which in NYC means several canvasses a week on college campuses and disadvantaged communities around the city).\s\s\sFurthermore there have been massive phone banking and text banking efforts from volunteers across the country. All those texts you get are from volunteers and the campaign called 800000 people in a few days.\s\s\sAt the end of the day if you want Bernie to get elected you should look for events near you and get involved.  This campaign isn’t about him it’s about continuing to build the movement that he started in 2016 and that means getting as many people involved as possible.I think you are being one of those annoying armchair campaign chairs.  \s\sBErnie paid attention to registration and the primaries last time and he STILL got screwed.\s\sThe issue he needs to focus on is solidifying his voter support and enthusiasm.  The rest will take care of itself.  And if the DNC still chooses to cheat THEN there will be hell to pay.  But not if he legitimizes their metrics more than a year ahead of time.Been expecting she and Ilhan to do so due to them each co-sponsoring legislation with him. Happy Rashida is going for it too tho not surprised!along with Bernie's debate performance....this news plus Talib and Omar's endorsement makes it a good day for the movement.\s\srock on.It's actually perfect timing.  Faith in AOC restored.FINALLY.\s\sSmart political move on AOC's part. Warren is learning the hard way what happens when she goes against our movement and Bernie.This is A POWER MOVE. AOC was the coveted endorsement and Bernie will stay the course for winning this. If Tlaib and Omar endorse too it will be a MAJOR victory for Bernie. This is THE pivotal moment and expect more ammo from the Establishment to fly towards our movement.Omar and Rashida are also endorsing and will be with AOC at Bernie's rally this weekend. :DI can't wait to see the goat rodeo this becomes with the press.  I wonder who's darling young face they are going to use now when they want to sell their whole ""See? We're the resistance!"" narrative.  It's going to be hard to smear her and keep up the illusion of polarity when the right has already claimed her as their own boogeyman.While in a perfect world Bernie wouldn't have had a heart attack and this could have happened a month ago in our universe this appears to be perfect timing. \s\sBiden has now completely lost it but still desperately clinging to old school corruption like the senile nut he is and the media is completely all in on Warren even though many are still on the fence. All this time the squad has been gaining influence - and they were allowed to do so probably because they had not endorsed.\s\sSo now the media has to do a hatchet job on all of them.\s\sPlus Tulsi is still here apparently pissing the fuck off out of my blue-no-matter-who friends. I didn't catch the debate last night so I didn't see what she did that pissed my feed off. But it was hilarious coming home to.About timeBernie's campaign just went from ""too white"" (a lie) to ""too non-white."" \s\sCNN's John King asked last night if their endorsement made it too ""urban.""\s\sYou can't make this stuff up!The major media hates himWhat is insane is CNN calls trump and foxnews racist all day long and than says actual racist shit like thisCNN? Dog whistling? Woowhat!!if there's a clip that needs to go viral it's this one.""An influential voice among young liberals"".\s\sTry progressives. Liberals hate AoC.A lot of the CNN /MSNBC crowd actually has a very favorable opinion of her because those networks cashed in on her victory for views and much like with Trump they had zero concept of the long-term ramifications of their actions.If this has any effect who wants to bet that Obama will come out of the woodwork shortly to endorse Warren lmaoNo chance in hell. He puts party over people and will not dare tarnish his legacy by snubbing Biden like that.Warren will probably call Hillary for the endorsementNew York 2020 Election \s\s[Primary Election Party Affiliation Deadline](https://voterreg.dmv.ny.gov/MotorVoter/): February 14 2020 \s\s[Primary Election Voter Registration Deadline](https://voterreg.dmv.ny.gov/MotorVoter/): April 3 2020 \s\s[Primary Election](https://voterreg.dmv.ny.gov/MotorVoter/): April 28 2020 \s\s[General Election Registration Deadline](https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/votersearch.aspx): October 9 2020 \s\s[General Election](https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/votersearch.aspx): November 3 2020oh if tulsi did better than warren or klob I will laugh so hardTulsi is going to do better than that in NH.So hope she does!Now is not the time to get comfortable.\s\sComplacency will cost us the nomination if we let it!For people who are worrying too much about NH I recommend looking at the polling and final [2016 NH results at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_New_Hampshire_Democratic_primary).\s\sAs with this year Iowa was 8 days before NH.  Iowa 2016 was a virtual tie but Hillary had a slight SDE edge over Bernie and called it a ""win"".  Hillary got a significant bounce if you look at Lowell.  However the final results significantly beat the post-Iowa polls.\s\sSo don't get discouraged.  But don't get complacent either.  Keep working!**2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary**\s\sThe 2016 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary took place on February 9. As per tradition it was the first primary and second nominating contest overall to take place in the cycle. Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in the primary by a margin of more than 22% in the popular vote. Sanders claimed 15 delegates to Clinton's 9.It occurred on the same day as the Republican primary.\s\s***\s\s^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\s^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28Great to see Tulsi ahead of Klobuchar!\s\sYes I know it would be better if her supporters voted Bernie but I do like Tulsi and like to see her get support in spite of the DNC and Hillary.\s\s*Edit*: imagining Hillary furious over this makes me smile.if she beats warren it would be great not just the klob\s\sIf Bernie wins and she beats out warren and klob that would be perfectI'm pretty certain Tulsi voters voted for Bernie in Iowa. However she has a much stronger foothold in New Hampshire.And if you think this is an honest poll got a bridge to sell you.fxxx cnnWell I’m glad to see Biden Warren and Klob doing poorly. I’m sure Pete’s numbers are inflated but maybe the others are accurate because they have to be  right on at least a few candidates to retain some credibility.If CNN has him at 28 then he's definitely higher.Double Yang's pittance lol.Generally these sorts of executives are offered money to keep them from jumping off the sinking ship - leaving behind years of knowledge about the structure and business operations of the company that other people can't just come in and pick up.\s\sWhile distasteful it actually makes it *less* expensive to dissolve the company.  The only way you could get around offering these sorts of incentives is to institute some form of quasi slavery into legality.  Something like ""it's illegal for an executive to quit a failing company"".   Of course then they could sit there and obstinately not do anything.  So you'd have to make it illegal to not work while being forced to stay in a job.  Penalties maybe incarceration?  20 lashes?  Dunno.  Uncharted territory.  It'd also be really hard for an outsider to measure what was being done.\s\s-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\s\sSo that's the why answer to Bernie's rhetorical question.  All that being said I don't like it either and fuck them.  So what's the solution?  How can it be fixed without despotic laws or other less savory things?Sears was bought by Eddie Lampert in 2005 and asset stripped. The company was ruined but Eddie made a handsome profit. My guess is that the bonuses are one more way of squeezing the little remaining value out of the company. The American Prospect (generally neoliberal) has a useful piece on it. I am sure there are others.\s\s[https://prospect.org/article/how-sears-was-gutted-its-own-ceo](https://prospect.org/article/how-sears-was-gutted-its-own-ceo)Company is already bankrupt so the structure and business operations are  meaningless. Sears no longer exists. Sell off the assets and give them to employeesWe stop buying their products. Will never happen because the general masses are so consumed in Bs like Russia or sex scandals that they don't even blink at a story like this. Add to this the media will never push a story like this because it doesn't get clicks. Because the executives (that are getting the tiny parachutes) are refusing to dole out ANY money for anything else.\s\sThat is why they get the ""bonuses"" \s\sTo make things go as smoothly as possible for the powers that be.\s\sFirst things first: cut off the labor force from renumeration. \s\sGotta love capitalists............... I hope the primary doesn't devolve into trading cheap shots over identity politics (although it's already telegraphed that they'll keep hitting Bernie on that) but if it does Biden wouldn't fare well.  Bernie has made a lot of progress in his knowledge and ability to speak about racial and other intersectional issues.  Biden needs to explain actually drafting and then going onto brag about the 1994 crime bill how he treated Anita Hill to a post Kavanaugh electorate and calling Obama ""clean"" which is cringier than any of Bernie's slip ups.buncha' racistsOther than name recognition why would people prefer Biden?  Honestly question.  I don't get the appeal.  It is just the Obama connection and the perception that Obama was good for us?It's just the Obama connection. >It is just the Obama connection and the perception that Obama was good for us?\s\sBoth.  And possibly that whole Joe from Scranton thing.Comfort factor for a cadre of older voters who stick with MSM and accept the ""radical"" and ""extreme"" tags hung on Bernie. Biden's been on the political landscape for most of their lives and they still regard Obama favorably.  \s\sNot all older voters but a segment.\s\sHell yea. I mean you cant top 'I marched with Martin Luther King jr' *and* I got arrested by the establishment fighting for the rights of African Americans.\s\sThat was 50 years ago! No sudden change to appease voters for an election. Character. From day one. On the right side of history from day one. \s\sThe Jedi Returns.Well who woulda thunk that black voters might prefer an ""old white male"" social democrat with policies that would help black communities and with a history of doing fairly well on race issues compared to most politicians who fought for civil rights when it counted in the 60's over a young black female social-climbing prosecutor who argued in favor of prison slave labor because it was cheaper for the state?\s\sTo expect black voters to come out in support of Harris just because of her youth gender and skin tone no matter how toxic her record has been towards the black/brown community is soft racism of low expectations. \s\sIt's good to see Bernie is popular among black voters too but really it's the idea that Harris is automatically considered a shoo-in regardless of her record that bothers the hell out of me. Yeah ironically it’s really racist to assume black people are going to vote against their self interest because the opponent is black. > To expect black voters to come out in support of Harris just because of her youth gender and skin tone no matter how toxic her record has been towards the black/brown community is soft racism of low expectations.\s\sHarris' opening salvo for Nevada in Las Vegas was well...

Do you see that ""other discussions"" tab?Sorry DNC your ADOS strategy is not working.Establishment dem goons tried to tar twitter #ADOS as russian bots. Didn't go well.I tried to DuckDuckGo to find out what ADOS means and only got Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Thank god non of this bullshit identity politics is ganna play anymore. Sorry DNC. What's crazy is that ""identity politics"" doesn't even mean what neoliberals use it to mean.   It simply means forming alliances based on common interests.  \s\sIf I'm African-Amercan (I am btw) then I have common interests with other African-Americans - but that translates into wanting policies that will help not only Blacks but everyone faced with the same issues that Black people are faced with.  \s\sTo Bernie's point on MANY issues (but not all) that includes rural Whites and poor Whites.  \s\sWhat ""identity politics"" does NOT mean is voting for or supporting candidates BECAUSE of their race or gender.  That's called stupidity.  \s\sBut the neoliberals push this idea because they've put a Black face on conservative principles like supporting oligarchies free markets over healthcare and the boogie-man of 'socialism.' \s\sMLK before he was assassinated pushed heavily the idea of a Poor People's Campaign that was all-inclusive.  He wrote and spoke about the needs of all people regardless of race to work against the oligarchical capitalistic system that has not only crushed us under the boot of the ultra-wealthy and the military industrial complex; but has pitted us against one another using asinine entirely invented social categories like ""race.""  \s\sBernie's revolutionary message is in the exact same spirit and ideal as MLK's Poor People's Campaign.  And that's why the neoliberals and the conservatives hate him.This is nice to hear and I hope it's true.  While I don't buy into the media narrative that Bernie ""has trouble with everyone except white men ahhhhhh doom!"" I have been worried about the reparations stuff.  I wish Bernie would just work with Shaun Nina etc and come up with a statement something like ""The reparations we support  are such and such dollar amount over such and such time specifically devoted to programs and small business in Black and Native American communities"" along those lines.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSomehow he can say that and it's all ""Bernie is against reparations!"" but Kamala and Warren and Marrianne Williamson for that matter can say the same less in fact and be heralded.  Obama did not even say that.  Obama just flat out said no.  Can't imagine Biden would say ""Yes we will have the checks in the mail the day after I take office"".  He would say no or if we're lucky he will talk about some program to bolster the most deeply affected communities specifically in regards to horrendous history of slavery racism etc.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sBut I think it's an important issue that needs to be discussed directly and I think some feel the question is being pushed aside.There’s no reason for Bernie to buckle to pressure and start pledging cash payouts.  That’s flat-out pandering.  Pledging to put resources into communities makes far more practical sense and has far more general appeal.\s\sAs it is the very idea of cash pay-outs is a very flawed one with a lot pitfalls.  Advocates need to explain the particulars of how they propose it could work not just passively-aggressively imply racism with “do you support reparations”.Reparations would involve the Dutch and British. You know the country that started the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and the country that brought slaves to the US? \s\sReparations aren’t about making amends. They’re about free money. Sanders is right not to engage on the subject because a real answer isn’t what anyone wants. People just want free money. Chappelle already dealt with this and the fact that everybody seems to have forgotten that really shows he was right to end his show. \s\sThe best solution involves completely restructuring education strengthening the social safety net ending the War on Drugs passing universal health care and overhauling the criminal justice system. Sanders knows this. Anybody with half a brain knows this. This isn’t what most people want and definitely isn’t what any mainstream corporate Democrat will give. \s\sJust look through this thread and all the talk across the internet about reparations. Does anybody really think a bunch of money given to black people is going to fix anything? Haven’t we already more than proven that such a clearly racist non-pervasive effort won’t actually accomplish a goddamn thing?\s\sBlack people don’t need money. They need equal rights equal opportunities and equality of justice. That’s 3 things they don’t have right now that can’t simply be purchased with a bunch of money or projects (pun fucking intended). To Marrianne Williamson's credit [she already had reparations in her platform when she announced](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/427859-new-dem-presidential-candidate-calls-for-spiritual-awakening-in). ([And an opinion piece she did almost a year ago saying the same thing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/04/why-we-need-both-a-national-apology-and-reparations-to-heal-the-wounds-of-racism/?utm_term=.c92aaab067a6))\s\sAs of now she has called for 100B (at least) to be invested in black communities. Nothing about a direct payment tho I do not think she's opposed. I had mentioned before that her plan as it stands now could be incorporated into Bernie's infrastructure plans.So you want Bernie to announce his withdrawal from the race? Or are you so obtuse and live in such a bubble you think reparations are ever going to happen on the planet where you live? But... but ... but ... out of touch old white man!!!!\s\s&#x200B;\s\s&#x200B;\s\s&#x200B;\s\s/sIt’s almost like people don’t care about appearance and race and more about policy and substance. The fact he's a communist is the bigger issue. who would imagine so many black people are racists.Let's hope someone has the sense to ask her why that is an undisputed fact in one of the first debates. Dems are gonna be looking to someone else after the first few primaries begin. Kamala coming in as one of the favorites according to the media and getting lots corporate money is just like Jeb. Plus likewise with Jeb she's not very appealing and doesn't even fill small venues. Hopefully Biden doesn't come into the race since he could very well sway the Obama-Hillary flunky voters to him.> Dems are gonna be looking to someone else after the first few primaries begin.\s\sYou might need to be a little more specific than that... If I've got the schedule correct California is the 5th primary (tied with several others for that spot). Do you mean *before* California or *after* California?Honestly Bernie Sanders is 100% the best choice for all americans unlike the vast majority of our politicans. Bernie Sanders has a ultra clean and spotless political record and this should be very attractive to americans however we seem to be very ignorant of morality when it comes to politics.Awww blacks are not being reliably stupid enough to suit the Dem corporatists. And they never were stupid enough to vote Republican. That takes a SPECIAL kind of stupid the kind of stupid that produces horrific mistakes like Donald Trump.Yes because lord knows the republican voters are the ones who are still poor Kamala Harris is descended from a lineage of Jamaican slave owners and opposed releasing non-violent drug users from incarceration because it would decrease California's prison labor pool.\s\sBy this time next year Bernie will have a 9-1 lead over Copmala Harris in the polls.Hilarious when she realizes she has to *pay* reparations. I agree 100% but I think we should leave bad name puns to the GOP... Remember Killary and Obummer. I just face palm super hard at bad political name puns at this point.Kamala Harris is a poser opportunist who slept her way into her career.Would you mind sourcing that? I'd like to read about it myself. Black people rejected Kamala Harris before she even ran. She was NEVER going to get the black vote. That's why she's trying so hard.Didn’t she put a shit ton of black people in jail because of weed?Her whole appeal (to white DNC voters) is that she can deliver the black Obama voters who sat out 2016 in MI and WI.  If she can't do that what good is she?I actually liked Bernie's Breakfast Club interview.  It was tough but it came more across like a bunch of New Yorkers having a convo on a street corner or something.  \s\sEver notice when Bernie gets pushed he gets more Brooklyn?

The rec list over there is viewed by tens of thousands of people daily mostly people who are undecided - this helps what we're trying to achieve!\s\sLet's do what we can to change the nonsense narrative about Bernie not appealing to minorities when in REALITY **he's polling better among Blacks than Whites in numerous polls**!  Biden is polling better? How fucking stupid are americans? How absolutely fucked in the head are they not to see Biden as another neo-liberal stooge to see their preference as merely a juvenile desire to connect back to Obama? Biden is like Clinton. The more he talks the more his numbers go down. That’s why he’s polling so high. Because he literally hasn’t said a word. A lot of people just miss Obama and probably see Biden as a way to go back to before things got fucked by Trump. \s\sI don't blame them for the desire but Biden is not who we need. She ain't real and trying to act real.Hillary 2.0She smoked at least one marijuana with Biggie Snoop and the Tooth Fairy.Well when your whole career is basically jailing black people why is this surprising?   Aunt Tom.Fuck yes[deleted]I agree that she has less name recognition. However that isn't the same as winning. Bernie was dealing with that same issue during his last campaign due to the Bernie Blackout (which refers to the mainstream press pretending like Bernie and his supporters didn't exist). Now Politico CNN AP etc. all run one smear after the other. Despite the blatant hatred of the corporate media toward Bernie and his supporters he is still leading due to his policies.Her criminal justice record alone is not sitting well with minoritiesThis is from the earlier Morning Consult poll\s\s>\sVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is leading all other announced candidates in support from black voters a new poll finds. The only potential candidate who polled better with African-Americans than Sanders according to the poll by Morning Consult is former Vice President Joe Biden who has not announced a campaign.\s>\sDespite a persistent notion that his supporters are disproportionately white male “bros” the new survey suggests that Sanders is actually slightly more popular among black Democratic voters than white ones indicating that the narrative that developed during the 2016 campaign may no longer hold if it ever did.I am not afraid of Biden once we get into voting history and track record Bidens support will drop. Hard truth is... generally black voters WILL NOT vote for a black person with a white spouse. White person with black spouse? Yes. If Michelle Obama was white Obama would never have been president. That's the long and short of it. The dems are so goddamn dense they thought a partial black person with a white spouse was going to be a shoe in. A prosecutor who sent a metric shit ton of black men to prison. Some of whom she KNOWINGLY knew the evidence was complete horse shit. A judge reprimanded her for doing so. Like if you don't get disbarred for that...A fucking orangutan could have ran under the D ticket in 2008 and won the presidency. Obama being black had nothing to do with winning in 2008 or 2012.  Someone need to inform them that skin color > policy \s\s/sFormer Vermont Gov. and Bernie-hater Howard Dean on corporate media today:\s\s""Don't red-bait Bernie it won't work.""Not ""it's morally wrong"" or ""it's incorrect"".\s\sJust ""it won't work"".\s\sAccuracy and ethics mean nothing to Dean.It didn't work when he won the Burlington mayoral race by 10 Votes in 1981 it didn't work when he won it again 2 more times after that.That is beautiful.  I got a little emotional listening to it.  I also noticed Bernie cough a little and wipe his nose.  I hope that he is not getting sick since that little ratty shit on the stage with him claims to have been ill with the flu but was going around shaking people's hands anyway.The CIA probably gave him a disease just so that he could give it to Bernie.The Russia stuff and red-baiting is not going to work. \s\sPeople like Bernie.  They trust Bernie.  He won 46% of the vote in 2016. 22 states and nearly tied in 6 others. \s\sAnd anyone who thinks it's a good idea to defend the murders and disappearances by the Contras in Nicaragua is plain crazy.  \s\s[We know what happened there.](https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-latin-america/#nicaragua-and-the-sandinistas)Also have you read the column Jesse Jackson Sr. wrote in the [https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2020/2/24/21151126/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-presidential-primary-jesse-jackson](https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2020/2/24/21151126/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-presidential-primary-jesse-jackson)?This is verifiably false.
