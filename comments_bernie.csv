0,DemocraticSocialism,WayOfTheBern,2122,"I'll believe corporations are people when one goes to prison.And diesEvery corporation is so heavily leveraged in debt because of stock buy backs. They just know when shit hits the fan they’ll be bailed out>This is ~~what we call~~ a dystopia we've been trained and conditioned by our public school system and our Mainstream Propaganda Apparatus to *believe* is a Democratic Republic.\s\sIf we were honest in our assessments of our government's representation of the average American citizen Robert's statement would read more like:\s\s>""No citizen-- not airline employees not hotel employees not cruise ship employees -- should be bailed out.  They can survive by borrowing at exorbitant interest rates using their labor as collateral.\s\s>Taxpayer money should be used to bail out corporations not people.Whores have to pay their pimps.This got a chuckle outa me. One of those “I gotta hand it to ya” chuckles. But if America isn’t capable of pimpin without these corrupt entities in the back pockets of our government then we are doomed. I think you and I both know we could still strut it.Those are key Bourgeois industries and why they will always be bailed out.Those art key bourgeois industries and wherefore they shall at each moment beest bail'd out\s\s***\s\s\s\s^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\s\sCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult` `!fordo` `!optout`CorrectThis is why most Americans don't wanna pay higher taxes and get stuff like tax funded healthcare and tax funded tertiary education.\s\sThey will just use our money for this shit. We basically pay taxes for ' existing ' to our billionaire overlords who fund these governments ( lol election donations ).\s\sThe infrastructure of the whole country is collapsing we are already paying taxes as high as the Canadians ( Alberta and Saskatchewan level ) and we don't have anything that they have but we do have our rich overlord billionaires ! Take that CANADA!!!But corporations are people! Really big important ones!! /sBailouts have winners and losers.  The losers are always the taxpayers and the currency being devalued.Or we can go back to the creative destruction that is supposed to be one of the benefits of Capitalism instead of our protected Oligarchy bullshit system we have.  If you don't want that then FUCKING ADMIT you want government intervention and that yes government is the answer.In my experience “Conservatives” always say they are against corporate bailouts but since they would never turn against their side there are never consequences for the Republicans who vote for them.Americans think that if a company goes bankrupt it disappears. :facepalmWhat are we doing about it? Acting like children instead of finding new ways and methods that will secure our survival in the future. \s\sNews Flash: No one is coming to save us. We must save ourselves.How's that ""We'll push Biden to the left"" strategy going Bob"".Well Democrat Party loyalist Robert Reich did you tell that to NANCY PELOSI SHE'S IN CHARGE!Who else do you think he is talking to?They should have used the so called “Rescue Plan” funds to cancel all public college debt. That would have been the most productive use of the money. The bill is nonsense most of it has nothing to do with COVID. What a corrupt short sighted immoral and foolish civilization this is.This mf spittinLet's just give them back all of their tax dollars.All 750 of them $$$So they now have to repay the money they got under their negative tax rate? Cool. I'm sold.A great and smart man. I love robert reich. I hope y’all have seen Saving Capitalism and Inequality for All on Netflix.Sounds like Robert who happens to be one of the good guys has forgotten what the spine of capitalism is. Exploitation of the closest most vulnerable least protected. And use racism wherever possible.\s\sMy dictionary says dystopia is imaginary. Most of the world wishes you were right Robert.Is he a good guy? He's a vote blue no matter who constantly gaslighting libsI would say no airlines and cruise ships these are big compaines that need huge capital to start - only rich can start this types of business. Hotel and industry *can* be a very very small business - but most hotel are big compaines. My family company is basically an industry we are not rich on what we do it’s the oppesite we are poor because we love what we do. I live in Norway I could drop my family company where I had $6.3 hr rate for 2-3 years and go into supermarket and earn $19 a hr. I think small industry and hotel should be bailed out but big compaines have millions on hand (saving accounts) that they can spend but they prefer not because they rather milk the government for taxpayers money.\s\sMy family company suffer atm many times close to bankrupt but then I have to illegally work long to save the family company. Yes illegal. You are not allowed to work more then 40hrs a week. The norm is 375hr a week here.\s\sJust sucks that we are a company that care about quality and handmade over mass production making ous expensive so we live on hard work.\s\sI know this post is about USA and I’m from Norway. But I see myself and can imagine many USA compaines are in the same situation small newly started or a family company that care about quality over quantity = barely liveable salaries.Is Robert Reich reputable? Jw bc conservatives seem to think he's notWell he seemed to be mostly on the Bernie side in 2020 until Bernie gave up the fight then he instantly went full ""vbnmw trump bad"" with nothing as far as criticisms of Biden's record that I can find.\s\sMake of it what you will. To me it looks a lot like so many others who say the words when it's easy but roll over and fall in line as soon as it's more convenient.\s\sOne of the ""strongly-worded letters"" clan.[deleted]Robert Reich knows his stuff and makes great points on social media. And then tends to use his popularity to usher people into voting using ""lesser evilism"" ""logic"" and simply sheepdogging for neoliberalism. Between election seasons he's great to follow- just don't idolize him or think he is actually on your side. As others said he's a long time Clinton crony.Been seeing a lot of Robert Reich around here lately!\s\sI’m sure everyone here will agree with this tweet:\s\s>	Today Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law.\s\s>	This bill won't just help struggling Americans weather this crisis — it will help restructure the economy to put working people first and reduce the out-of-control inequality that's plagued the country for decades.\s\s-	Robert Reich\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\sI like turtles.In what way does it ""restructure the economy to put working people first?"" Another one time check that's less than some people's monthly rent? Maybe raising min wage would actually be an argument to put people first.""restructure the economy to put working people first?"" Lolz. Nah. Then they should have used this funds to cancel all public college debt. That’s the most productive use of this So called Rescue Plan funds.Robert Reich is a fucking joke and a shill.\sStop spreading this shithead aroundHe generally isn't the best that doesn't mean he isn't correct here.Ad hominem fallacy.\s\sJudge the argument not the person making it.It's not about bailing out the travel industry.  It's about not subsidizing all the other less-affected industries like computing tech and online retail.  If you don't bail out airlines you're basically saying that in the event of no virus to take their profits you would have randomly pumped their taxes up to do it instead and done no such thing for the other industries.But Biden is trying really really hard to get a $15/hr minimum wage for **government** employees.\s\sIs that supposed to impress us?People are paid not in proportion to their importance alone but by how easily they can be replaced. Forcing higher pay distorts the market which isn't cool because the market is very good at doing what it's indented to do. It's so good that it will screw people over to accomplish it's goal.  Instead change the market so it naturally produces better outcomes. Replace the incentive to increase shareholder value with the incentive to increase human well-being and the market will find ways of doing that very well.  Think outside the box.Can someone decipher this tweet?""We can't raise the wages for anyone who is underpaid because it would be unfair to all the other people who are also underpaid.""""$600 was a downpayment"" - shitlibs that unintentionally admitted that the two parties are actually just one and the same.If it was a downpayment shouldn't everybody who got that ""downpayment"" also get the rest of the $2000?He bombed Syria/Iraq anyways.Lol and thats why I knew better it was supposed to be a bribe ""vote for me and I'll give you money"" no bitch give me the money and I'll vote for you. That's how it should have gone.[deleted]Yeah sure dictators can be voted out /s\s\sdumb ass shitlibsThe 4th Reich is currently in the WH. Don't be fooled by the rainbow flags.Because fuck you that's why. That actually describes our entire approach to healthcare.Nah. That’s inaccurate and misrepresenting the health care system. \s\sIt’s “fuck you pay me”The pharmaceutical companies contribute to political campaigns.One group has political power and the other doesn'tYeah *""price gouging for all - power to the people!"".*For that matter why is charging $6 for a case of water not price gouging?Because big businesses are allowed to do that. They're supposed to do that it's how they make profit. Them benefiting by charging more is just ""good business"" but if a small business or individual tries to exploit others in the same way they have to be knocked down a peg. To keep them in their place.How much do you think it costs to make a bottle put water in it put on a label then package a bunch of bottles together into a case and ship it to a store and then for the store to stock it and sell it?You could petition your local or state govt to increase water quality standards then you don’t have to buy bottled water. I mean you’re already taxed for it anyways. Make them step up. Oh...I forgot taxes are never used properly and efficiently.Maybe the people price gouging for water should hire some lobbyist and start making campaign contributions.As far as I know price gouging laws in the US are only in effect in emergencies.Then the real question is why the diabetes crisis isn't considered an emergency.Because the price of water reflects actual scarcity while insulin prices just reflect how intellectual property laws are designed to favor the richYeah that's definitely more like a homeless shelterI saw an episode somewhere about a guy in San Francisco living in one of these renting a parking space to use as an office during the day.  This is definitely a weird way to frame this.That young person has money for hats!  Clearly they afford a down payment on a Boomer McMansion. /s[Direct link to this Tweet.](https://twitter.com/nashville_brook/status/1359143201496514566)Sometimes people who have no rent money  ""choose"" to live in a car their own or an abandoned one.  \s\sNo accounting for tastes as the saying goes. /sThis is what happens when you let people like Bill Gates Klaus Schwab Jeff Bezos Elon Musk the media (which the 1% controls) the intelligence agencies (which work for the 1%) the WEF the WHO and other billionaire/multinational conglomerates (NGO's think tanks) decide how 99% of humanity should live and we just accept their bullshit without questioning it.\s\sIf we don't reject their narratives and refuse to comply with their authoritarian desires then this is the future they have planned for all of us. Cages (""pods"") no privacy no freedom to make our own decisions no freedom to decide what we eat what is injected into us or not. These predator don't care about race gender political affiliation - they want to control and in Bill Gates' case cull as many of us as possible.\s\sThose dystopian movies of yesteryear weren't off the mark at all...The WHO? You mean the UN? Are you drunk?Seems to me almost 4 billion people should be able to take 3 assholes on a vacation. To the moon.I’m hoping all the rich flee to Mars or some Elysium type shit and then get a major oxygen leakWhat happens when it gets to one? Does that person just sorta implode into an unstoppable greed singularity? Do we allow it to get that far?It’s like the end of the monopoly game starts moving faster until there’s nothing left for anyone elseWhy can't we just kill them...?So the eight trillion spent destroying USSR which was working on ending poverty was worth it I guess...\s\sDodged a bullet there eh! oligarchy.I feel so bad for the five who lost out!\s\s/sBefore we had to be concerned whether the checks went out with Trump's name on them.  Now we have to worry that literally *thousands of dollars* might end up in the hands of rich people.\s\sIs there like an objective unit of measure for disingenuousness?  If not let's call it the ""Dem"" as in ""the concerns that are holding up aid to the struggling American public measure over 25000 Dems.""How about Decepticrats?Normal people who don't follow politics every day like us masochists will see the long wait and final $1000 check or whatever and be asking where the other promised half went that was supposed to come ""immediately.""

He didn't warn us!  It doesn't matter that any of those other politicians had the info and could have warned us and not only didn't but did insider trading to profit off their special knowledge only Trump can ever be responsible for anything!  Plus Pelosi tore up a copy of Trump's speech!  She's an American hero!  How dare you impugn the honor of a True American Hero!  She *deserves* to get rich off of our suffering!

Pentagon budget is going to be $753b\s\shttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/budget/547412-sanders-expresses-serious-concerns-with-bidens-defense-increaseShort term profits will be the death of us.> The strength of Marx’s critique is that in its breadth of disciplinary and historical scope it managed to identify how the hydra of market economy comes to dominate its operators how Capital rules in the domains of both production and ideology and how via the notion of “self-interest” it diffuses responsibility for its crimes in an incredibly elegant way. The social planning and hierarchical organizational structures humans have built to fight Capital stand out as alien when contrasted with the naturalized discipline imposed by the market in the “free world” however ruthless. Getting over the misconception that these structures are unnecessary allows us to begin learning from the experience of comrades around the world both in and out of power.\s\s\s> To defeat Capital we must understand how it works so we can exploit its weaknesses. As Huey Newton put it: “You cannot oppose a system such as this without opposing it with organization that’s even more extremely disciplined and dedicated than the structure you’re opposing.” An understanding of capitalism’s inner dynamics coupled with careful and broad study of the real history of class struggle will enable us to fight to free humanity from domination by Capital from within the imperial core. Nothing less than this will do.\s\shttps://redsails.org/why-marxism/hoW arE yOu GOinG tO pAy FOr iT?>[The blasted ruins of a dying city. Corpses tanning on boiling hot concrete.

The collectors started calling my grandma who was prepared to pay but told them it would have to wait a month. Collections guy didn’t skip a beat and asked “well how did you pay for his funeral?” She’s refused to pay since and they’ve called her multiple times a week for 12 years.Smart grandmother.  If she paid even one payment they'd say she agreed to take on the debt.  They are slimy bast\*\*ds.There is a statute of limitations on unpaid debt. I believe it is 7 or 10 years - depending on the state (in some states there is no time limit). However she made the mistake of answering the phone which effectively gets the clock ticking again every time she does. What your grandmother needs to do is to check the law in her state on unsecured debt and how long it stays on her record. \s\sIf she does want to negotiate paying it  she should point her intention of filing for bankruptcy (whether true or not). That will get them to come to the table and settle real quick. likely for much less than what she owed.If I ever get diagnosed terminal I’m getting every single solitary thing out of my name then running up a debt avalanche that would bankrupt a small African countryJust make sure it's all credit card debt - not secured debt like for a car/house.  Sounds like that's what you're saying anyway.You get audited before they allow you to go bankrupt and if they see you did that just after getting diagnosed with cancer you’ll be fucked by the tax guys anyway. \s\sBut do keep in mind I’m pretty sure you can write off some medical debt do some research on it but there was a post about it recently about unsecured medical debts.""But why do millenials like hate capitalism...?""Inverted Totalitatianism devalues the individual while Capitalist propaganda puts individualism paramount in the minds of the underclass.\s\sWhat a racket.Racket?  More like pure evil.    We're not a ""lesser species"": we can perfectly perceive what we do to one another to every last starving child.My grandma was a nurse who loved her job and put in insane hours. She was the only income for her household. She was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in April of 2016 and our road was very similar. Banks threatening to sue my grandfather causing him to become suicidal her insurance refusing to cover any medical bills medicaid refusing to help because she earned too much the 3 months previous to her diagnosis and rapid degeneration having to sell everything of worth they owned just to try to get her treatment we weren't even approved for hospice until the week of her passing. She died 6 months later in October of 2016. The funeral home who took her told my grandpa that he needed to to pay $3000 in full for them to cremate her and they refused to release her body to anywhere else who might help essentially holding her hostage if he couldn't pay (thank goodness for the generosity of a friend). The illness and losing her was incredibly traumatic but nothing topped how insensitive and greedily aggressive these institutions were to my poor grandfather disabled and unable to work himself. They cared about nothing but the money and getting it at any cost. It is terrible and I'm sorry you had to experience this agony as wellSo the ACA regulations and policies did not help with her insurance? I know of a similar occurrence with a family that when they were unable to work and lost their insurance Medicaid immediately approved her application and covered all medical bills. She was even able to have treatments at home. They did not have similar experiences with banks and credit because they did not live off credit and their home was already paid for. Unfortunately people do not read the contracts for loans well which explain what happened to your grandparents. In reality if these institutions did not aggressively collect what is owed the requirement for credit would make it impossible for people to get loans. If they did not enforce the contracts too many people would not bother to pay their loans off. \s\sDeath is a part of life and anyone able should make pre-arraignments so their families don't have to face what yours did. It is hard enough to lose someone let alone the stress of what you witnessed. There is free legal services available for those in your grandfathers predicament. It is a real shame he did not know to take advantage of it.Very evil.  Sorry that happened to her and to you.   \s\sA world run by corporations is a world where every evil thing can be justified by a corporation's profit motives and its fiduciary duties to its shareholders.  They have no duty to act in a moral way to customers employees or the world at large so they over-charge customers under-pay employees and pollute the environment.We're all sorry and sorry isn't enough to put peoples lives back together again.What's worse is the people making the phone calls/sending the letters on behalf of the credit card insurance and lending companies were probably doing it just to pay their own debt bills and mortgages.that's true.  in medical alone you have hundreds of thousands of employees working coding and billing trying to get doctors & hospitals paid and a similar amount on the other side trying to avoid paying.  \s\sit's like Big Sports but less entertaining.Do people realize that not one word of complaint put forth on this site has any nexus to the country which spent time and resources saving lives around the world during COVID19.

I truly hope that China Russia DPRK and others come to realize that they must help protect the world from the coalition of greed that is America Israel Britain NATO et alOther countries treat Americans ten times better than America tests her citizensThat's kind of ironic because as bad as America treats its citizens it treats others ten times as bad. A democracy would begin to slowly change that. However a cellular tiered democracy CTD would begin to quickly change that.\s\sYou may not know that the reasons America had Qaddafi murdered was twofold. First he was proposing a panAfrican currency which would diminish America's MIC IMF and IC powers. But perhaps worse Libya had a very experimental party free democracy where the chicanery that is rife in U$ adversarial politics is changed to a cooperative model with allegiance to the electorate rather than a rich thug club like both DNC and RNC are. Libya was the most successful state. Ameri~KKK~a has turned it into an open slave market.What a profoundly evil *America*. ftfyHorrific. As executor of my aunt’s will I still get contact from all these and more over two years after her death. Soulless our society.So sorry to hear of your struggles. It doesn't help that the party which set the stage for the foreclosure crisis and made it worse will now be in power under the man who was responsible for making it worse. We are supposed to believe times will change bec Trump is miraculously gone. However a return to the status quo the invisibilising of people like you are all that these people want to get back to. Watch how they become millionaires by the end of 4 yrs..Republicans are responsible for this kind of shit that you and your mother went through. All they care about is money and power. They are truly evil people.Not so much. The ACA passed as it is now without a single Republican voter.\s\sThey didn't need any Republicans they needed every Democrat on-board and its current configuration is how they decided it would and should look. \s\sI'm not saying the GOP would be any better but blaming Republicans for the current state of things when literally all of them voted against it and it still passed is completely stupid.\s\sWe need M4A but most Dems are legitimately not interested in M4A. We need to stop blaming ""the other side"" for the current mess that was passed by and designed to appeal entirely to Democrats. That it's a bloated bureaucratic mess is exactly the way everything would be if this was a one-party country.\s\sInstead we need to reach out to the more ""real"" Republicans. The ones who are outliers in their own party. A new consensus needs to form.\s\sUnfortunately the establishments mete out the money and are beholden to corporate donations who are not interested in reform.\s\sWolfPAC is your best bet for a start and then (And only then) does the party lose its total reliance on appeasing corporations.CoUlD nOt HaPpEn UnDeR dEmOcRaTs.And you are truly naive if you see only one evil wing of the American~duopoly.\s\sHowever the JoeyKkkamy show is about to kick off. Let's see. Betting against JoeyKkkamy is voting against the burro that is  running against Secratariat.Don't worry.  Things will get better now that the rapist (D) is in office....Well except for the part about being hounded by credit card companies the health care thing and the foreclosure problem. \s\sBut hey there won't be any more crazy tweets so that's something right?First let me say that it is sad that that happened to your mother or anyone else's mother anywhere on earth.\s\sI get a lot of pushback against my commie politics which causes me to ask any who would do the pushing if they are aware of the fullness of reality that not only is this gentleman's mother's experience of eight years ago or today an experience typical of  capital(MONEY)ist America but such action is anathema to any commun(PEOPLE)ist administration. For example while USSR was doing the civilized thing in such cases for three quarters of a century U$ofregimechangeA was spending post WWII the war U$biz's romance with Hitler and largess to nazi helped Franco Hitler and Mussolini destroy the legally elected government of Spain as a kind of ""spring training"" for WWII and like decades later when Kissinger helped murder elected Allende and install a fasci government in Chile which resulted in torture and murder the nazi~fasci Franco Adolf and Benito overthrow resulted in decades of America approved torture and murder.\s\sBut fullness doesn't just define the moment it also addresses the history and the comparative histories of barbaric world's greatest genocide and likely world's most profitable and barbaric rape and torture featuring and torture murder controlled slavery are what causes such as America to invent sins of commie to balance against the mass of criminality estimated by its politicos as perhaps a million or less but by contemporary knowledge is estimated at about 55 million person genocide and that cried out for the fantasy creation of worse crimes from commie. And like the genocide pegged at less than a million or diminishment from reality in the neighbourhood of 1÷100 the reverse is done in the American psyche. As cappie barbarity is reduced by a factor of ten thousand percent commie fantasy barbarity is increased in the American psyche by a similar amount.\s\sThis reality which folks I have to tell you is as obvious as the false flag treason by the criminal regime of POTUS43dubs+dikkk with help from CIA Mossad PNAC JCoS and Larry ""pullit"" Silverstein that is the miracle fest which was perpetrated on 09/11/01 for the purpose of setting the ME ablaze. But you have to look and you have to be loyal to science.\s\sThe entirety of fantasy that is based on the self serving evil called MANIFEST DESTINY which essentially means that it was gawadu's preferred outcome that €uro or ""real people"" should kill off and it not be murder because the ""injuns"" weren't ""real people"". You know ""pink skin"" And that same gawadu favored quarter of a millennia of slavery... kinda puts a justification spin on the barbarity of a victim a week for a century through lynchings and massacres.\s\sIt twar gawadu's weigh. Kkkood knot bee planer.\s\siT wAs GaWaDu'S wAy. It CoUlD nOt Be ClEaReR.\s\sI'm going with 99% and only because 100% just seems impossible. But I would definitely put a big nickel on it if it was on the Vegas book that in a relative sense to a panel of sane and intelligent America's kkkapitalism fails miserably and pathetically from a Judao~Christian perspective when compared to commie but only if one takes into consideration the barbarity of eight trillion dollars in cold war and a mountain of lies that makes Everest seem a speed bump.\s\sIt is beginning to come profoundly clear that from its start whenever you perceive that to be that your relationship with America is exactly what El Hajj Malik El Shabazz said:\s\sAh I say and I say it again. Ya been had! You've been took! Hoodwinked! Bamboozled! Led astray! Run amok!\s\sPost genocide and post slavery America since 1492 or 1619 or 1776 or 1865 has always been and firmly remains the most racist greedy and warmonger nation on earth faring poorly against all but Israel of its barbaric war hawk buddies and compared to any commie country...???\s\sWell it ain't shinola.\s\sOh and the fedkkkops got it wrong. It wasn't Ruskee or  China or Iran. It's Venezuela and Bolivia that are paying America's enemies to act like America's enemies. Are commies and taliban that civil that after two decades of barbarity that was the cause and effect of bU$h CIA Mossad PNAC and zionazi Larry ""pullit"" Silverstein 911 to create Afghanistan attack they have to be paid to hate their enemies.\s\sAmerican exceptionalism...???\s\sAh yes... you betcha...I think you can enhance readability by using parentheses as an aside or clarification.       \sSo for example: U$ofregimechangeA could be “USA  (U$ of regime change A)”.          \sThis way a reader could see the joke but not have to stumble over concatenated words - that can ruin the joke and the flow of the whole thesis.The ACA was supposed to eliminate insurance companies from denying claims. I guess it isn't quite what it is claimed to be. I would suggest anyone running up credit card debt should cut up their cards and live within their means. Blaming the companies that want to be repaid for bad decisions doesn't seem right. When you make a contract with someone expecting them to just absorb the loss when you fail to fulfill your part of the contract is not rational.Exactly! Well said. Billionaires and airlines need to stop making contracts with the government and their\s cronies expecting them to absorb the loss when they fail to fulfill their part of the contract and then asking for welfare handouts when they can’t meet final quarter profits. Blaming investors and clients that just want to be repaid for their own bad decisions isn’t right. It’s not rational. And for god’s sake these big corporations should really be living within their means. What a bunch of beggars.Your same sentiment is how those that suffered under racism feelgonna have to elaborate a little there friendYou can take your IDpol bullshit and fuck right off back to r/Politics you pathetic shill!Unpaid bills and credit card debt does not make the world evil.You've completely missed the point here *entirely*.\s\sBills and credit card debt for life-saving medical treatment most certainly make the United States (which happens to be the wealthiest nation on Earth) an evil place. This country just doesn't care about people unless they're rich and can pay.\s\sThere's plenty of money for universal healthcare to be implemented. They just choose not to because health insurance industry greed and preying on sick people for every last penny is more important to them.[removed]\show do Democrats expect to get enough people to vote for them in '22?\s\sThey don't care and Marianne should know better than to ask the stupid questions on social media that perpetuate the myth that they do.\s\sWinning the White House is just a perk that increases the party's revenue stream for the duration of time they've been allotted to deliver what their investors need from them.\s\sWhen their owners are finished with them they'll return to their alternate role as the #Resistance the party that fights for the poor and oppressed until their services are needed again.\s\sBeing the party in power isn't the goal.  The goal is to keep the people believing that the two party system of Government Inc. still belongs to them and that there are two competing ideologies fighting each other over how best to serve it's citizens.\s\sThey both work for the same people folks and those people aren't the voters they use to prop up the system that keeps their employers in power.  The blue wing of Government Inc. is the poseur that's occupying and defending the space an opposition party would normally occupy in a Democratic form of government.\s\sUntil the American people grow weary of trying to make the best of the bad situations they're presented with every election cycle stops making excuses for propping up the ""lesser"" evil because it's all that's offered and decides to destroy the fake opposition party the guards their owners gates it'll be the same as it ever was.\s\sAnd the days go by.....water flowing underground...Bernie should of been prez.

Also municipalities are required to provide cheap housing.I don't think I'm voting Democrat or Republican again.

I can’t think of anything progressive at all NOTHINGWell him and congress are on vacation after working 3 weeks.[deleted]He let the transformers to participate in sports. I hear it's progressive these days.They won’t even do a one time $2k stimulus.All political leaders are garbage (except bernie he’s my boy)I was going to say you should look outside the duopoly for good political leaders but the duopoly has made sure that it’s practically impossible for people outside the duopoly to attain political power.Their strategy will be Qanon man bad.and that strategy will fail and more Q's will be elected in 22' and in 24' they will have a majority.If only somebody had told them what would happen by voting for Biden...\s\sOh wait many did and got piles of shit dumped on them.\s\sWell here's your shit back eat it.When you elect a ""centrist"" like Biden it guarantees we won't get what we need for at least 8 years because if Biden/Harris do two terms that will be 8 years of no medicare for all or end to the wars and if they lose reelection then you have a guarantee that a Republican will come in and not help us for their 4 years. So either way you slice it you are screwed for eight years no matter what when you ""vote blue no matter who."" We need to stop voting for these people no ""lesser of two evils"" because evil is still evil.We need ranked voting so we can vote 3rd party without that meaning its handed right to republicans if that vote doesnt work outThere better not be a single democrat showing their face in Georgia when the midterms come around. After what they pulled no one should vote for them again.Yep. You're absolutely correct. And they asked for it. People gave them a chance and the very first thing they did was say go fuck yourselves to their entire base not just Georgia. It's absolute madness.It's almost as if they think voting is irrelevant.

There is NEVER a good time to criticize and hold them accountable and when it's the right time and valid they (w/ social media astroturf) and MSM will gaslight you over it.

They stay to the right to lure the right and the left won't vote for Trump 2.0 so... I mean you see the idea right?

Cuck.I don't like the way Marianne is wording this. It plays into the idea that the Democrats are just the hapless but well-meaning Good Guys. They're not. Following their North Star will lead us off the cliff just the same as the Republicans would.\s\sPeople need to accept that the Democrats have **wanted** to be the kinder gentler version of the Republican Party since the 1990's. They aren't actually interested in helping the poor and middle class but their use of that language is a holdover from the pre-Clinton era Democrats. \s\sThey don't care about helping people who are worth less than 7 figures. \s\sThis sort of language that implies that they mean well but are making tactical errors needs to be aggressively pushed back on.Republicans with kente clothMarianne is so close to actually getting it but constantly refuses to take that one last leap.Keep voting blue and you’ll end up with red policies.So true.So then what do I do.She is right. The pandemic will have run its course  despite zero  intervention from 45 and some talk but precious little action from 46\s\sDump  2.0 will likely  be less crude so Biden or Harris will get badly whooped unless the right is  dumb enough to actually rerun trump himself then the fauxgresives may eek out a victoryPretty likely that Trump would beat biden in the rematch.Trump is the most popular choice within  the republican party. Who knows? He could conceivably run for president the next time around. And if biden really pisses off the people they might just  punish him with a second term of Trump. I dont think it's likely but it is a possibility.But but vote blue no matter what?Relevant: https://youtu.be/BKcWTN8f7zQin all seriousness what is the option here? wouldn't you say that we already did that in 2016...and look what happened we got one of the worst presidency and government in American history. \sWhat is the realistic option here? Vote third party? Again that was more or less what was done in 2016. What else? \s\sIn my mind till people like Sanders become the norm there is little that we can do because neither GOP/Dem will fix the things that we need to get better (campaign finance gerrymandering voting rights term limits electoral college etc etc). For now the measure is what party can fuck us up less and the answer to a large level is quite easy: the democrats...at the very least i don't think they'd keep motivating fascism and white supremacy again for now the game is what party can fuck us up less.\s\sin any case we gotta hold on till the younger generation start voting for the AOCs of the future and hope that people like her are the future of this old ass democratic party that needs some serious new blood.And what do they get in ‘22 if they lose? More time to blame the other side for not getting anything done while having already done all the things their campaign donors needed done and preserving the 1% rule. Perfect play really for them.\s /sI think that’s their plan for successIf we're lucky the republicans will spilt.  Then the progressives can split out of the democrats.

There is only the one party of the oligarchy(1%) and they don't care if the D side of their party doesn't win in '22 because they **the one party always wins**... all while they use slight of hand and misdirection to keep you swinging back and forth between the two sides of one coin... throwing tomatoes at the puppets on stage while the puppet master behind the curtain always wins.There's rhetorical wiggle room on $2k.  They passed $2k stand alone in the House in November.  Moscow Mitch shut that down and left us with $600.

Others could argue in good faith that it should be a new $2k.\s\sThe minimum wage is in the House bill and it's not ""Democrats"" that oppose.  It's Joe Manchin and maybe a couple others.

I can’t understand you with my balls in your mouthI worry about the consequences too.\s\sEdit: I get it it’s an opposing viewpoint but realistically speaking how viable is it to just keep giving away money? I get that we already give away hella money to defense and foreign nation not to mention tax cuts and bail outs for the elite but the opposite extreme doesn’t strike me as any more viable. We need some balance in our fiscal policy one that ensures stability for the American people without bankrupting the nation.I didn't know who this lady is. Is she being sarcastic because if so I don't get that. Two of these three things are things that cane up and are supported. The 2k a month I never heard specifically but Yang spoke of UBI which I like. I am not a democrat and don't follow all these people nor am I on twitter. Im a ""own the means of production end capitalism socialist."" The one Trumpian on my Facebook page actually shared this as a 'they just want free stuff post. The left is pretty damn bad at PR and that is where the Republicans make all their ground.    And again where is this 2k a month coming from? Yang talked of UBI but that's as close as it got. Again back to PR little things like 2k monthly that no politicians spoke of is PR ammo for the right.  \s          \s·                    \s          \s-Edit: I reworded a lot of this because people seemed to not get my point.I'm gonna pretend you're not playing stupid\s\sMarianne Williamson - Google   \sIt's not meant to be an insult it's a genuine question.

If you know they're wrong debate them on why public assistance is not just some irresponsible handout that makes people lazy. That is if you actually disagree...The 2k a month has been floated on the fringes since last year it’s a good and popular progressive talking point but we’re still really far away from that. The 2k stimulus check was an explicit promise from the president to win Georgia. They’ve backed down to $1400 and are adding more means testing to reduce the amount of people who qualify. The $15 minimum wage was discussed between Biden and Bernie as Bernie tapped out of the nomination process. Biden was very clear that he would support a $15 minimum wage and that does not look like it’s going to happen in this package. Medicare for all seems to be off the table “Bidencare” is a weak expansion of Obamacare written mostly by healthcare lobbyists. Both parties in Washington are losing support of the people only 30% of Americans believe their party reflects their interests. If the Biden administration fails to enact bold popular policies 2022 could be a bloodbath and 2024 could see Trump 2.0 except not an idiot.I'm going to assume you're asking in good faith and let you know that all those things she mentioned were what the Democrats campaigned on throughout this last cycle.  The 2k checks we're promised repeatedly while they tried to win the two Senate seats in Georgia.\s\sIf you go to YouTube and type in Biden promises 2k checks Or democrats promise 2k checks there are literally hundreds of videos of it. \s\sIf you're asking why people need 2k checks look around and see the poverty and Devastation that is happening in this country both from shitty leadership and the pandemic.  People are fucking starving and getting evicted.You have to realize that just bec trumpians are def full of brain worms that you can’t just base your platform as “trump bad we good” and not do anything tangible and direct enough to back that up. And those issues listed are def those types of platform points that would raise their base. If just trying to play the game according to what MAGAs whine about you’re gonna have a bad time. Hell I’d argue those issues and the lack of them is some of the reason people are MAGAsThe time is always right to fight.this makes me so mad.

We're all heart that way.\s\sNot to mention that studies have shown that housing people costs society less than leaving them homeless. So it's not even about money.The best research on this subject comes from Finland where they practically did end homelessness and saved a lot of money at the same time!\s\sNumerous smaller scale studies showed it would work in the United States too including some done before Finland's national effort. By housing people they found they saved money on police courts emergency room visits and other social expenses related to homelessness which was significantly more than it cost to house them.\s\s[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/12/machiavellian-assault-on-science-poor.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/12/machiavellian-assault-on-science-poor.html)Bread and circuses. Turns out we're so advanced we don't even need the bread for we ARE the circus.Come now the empire isn't dying its transforming into another form. What apparently is dying is the aspiration to a democracy (or democratic republic) in the way we'd imagined when we were taught as kids. As the repubs and dems bow down to their corporate owners the financial holding companies that manipulate markets and media and governments grow ever stronger. Unions are corrupt! Government cannot be trusted! Socialism is bad! BLM are rioting! (but terroristic white nationalists don't exist) are all ploys used to propagandize and draw the noose around the neck of the people to choke our voice.Fearmongering about ""white nationalists"" is part of the propaganda. They needed a boogeyman even spookier than the republicans so now we have the Alt Right boogeyman to convince you to vote for Biden when neoliberals are the ones with all the power and the neoliberals are already white supremacist fascist Nazis anyways.And hunger. And free college.I'd go for forgiveness of student debt first [edit: before free college] because it cripples lives and robs people of a future and would immediately allow large numbers to cover more of their needs in times of hardship. Along with that I'd insist on the basics that all humans have as a birthright: adequate food and shelter in addition to universal health care.\s\sFree college is good as a concept but there's a problem. As a society we aren't addressing  how we're educating people and what we're educating them FOR beyond the h.s. level. Everyone should know how to read write and think critically to the full extent of their abilities. (imo civics US and world history and foreign languages are undervalued) Beyond that in economies based on consumerism and debt with automation bringing a shrinking workforce and rapidly changing horizons for paid employment the specialized knowledge individuals are educated to have and societies need no longer match. That matters in societies built on exchanges of services for payment. We're educating people for jobs that don't or won't exist. The premises of our economy no longer work for too many people.I have literally asked hundreds of people ""What is more evil than getting filthy rich off the sick and dying and then bankrupting them as they lay sick and dying?""  NO ONE CAN THINK OF A SINGLE THING MORE EVIL. As Congress gorges on the blood and flesh of the dead what are we suppose to do? Congress votes to kill millions of innocent people over seas and they don't vote to kill millions of innocent Americans. I think all of congress has a death wish.The US gov is only good at 2 things ignoring the needs of the populous and endless war. Meaning the USA is really good at going out of it's way to kill innocent people around the world for profits.It's neat to see the public at large figuring out what I've known for years.For context the military budget is roughly $650 billion dollars. America spends the most out of anyone. If you were to take the next 8 countries and combine all of their defense budgets  including China you wouldn't reach $650 billion. Now take the rest of the countries in the entire world and combine their defense budgets and  you wouldn't reach $650 billion.\s\sThe defense budget is irresponsibly large. The entire thing is a gigantic money laundering scheme designed to make defense contractors rich.But don't you like your freedom?! We couldn't be any more freer brother! /sTime to start reading [Rubicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91017.Rubicon) to see what we are in for.Now watch us pretend your health and well being matter to us. Wear that mask!Quit politicizing mask wearing.  If the government isn't going to take care of us citizens need to be looking out for each other as much as possible.  Wearing a mask and proper social distancing is the best way to do it and require zero effort to do.Given its death toll Covid is the most serious national security issue.  Why aren’t we everyone we stepping up as though it were an invasion?  Get the vaccines moving.It's been about genocide since 1492 slavery since 1619 and war for empire since just this side of 1865 perhaps earlier. It has constantly ($)elected warmongers and ignored peacemakers like McGovern Mike and Bernie. In 1972 even chosing one who's first three letters mean ""zilch"" and had to leave in disgrace over one who had the word ""Govern"" in his name.\s\sSad to say that America's history profoundly resoundingly says that the vast number of well over 100 million victims very possibly 200 million victims Natives of Turtle Island genocided vicious dictators accommodated  Africans brutally enslaved and world wars fomented were the epitome of obscene profits. The perpetrators of such would obviously rather destroy earth and humanity before failing again like despots Hitler and Mussolini that U$biz did more than any others to create and make WWII a reality.\s\sSo extreme was the nazi sentiment among U$ wealthy that an attempted coup d'etat of FDR by very wealthiest traitors was ridiculed by the propaganda arm of barbaric permawar fasci M$M. M$M which stands for main stream media is the bodyguard of lies that such as U$ war machine has always required and has always received. FYI the perpetrators of ""The Business Plot"" as M$M cutely named it were the biggest supporters of Franco and the overthrow of the legally elected government of Spain which helped arm and train nazi Germany and fasci Italy for WWII. Union Bank of Manhattan was in a treasonous posture from when FDR declared on Dec7'41 until Oct20'42 when they were raided.\s\sUnderstanding of what transpired with Smedley D.Butler the most decorated marine of his day who attempted to bring the traitors to justice and was ridiculed by M$M is one of the most glaring but by no means only examples of proof that M$M is about massage not about message. \s\sIsn't knowingly aiding the enemy during war time even though it was financial treason? Or is that just capitalism again saying we have too many people and not enough money?\s\sI fear the planet is already past surviving the devastation that America and its current allies like Israel Brazil Ukraine Colombia who will dominate from the extreme right or destroy.\s\s9095 was the number of the warrant that was used to bust Union Bank which was rewarded like a hero corporation for trying the nazi overthrow of America.They will need the military to quell the inevitable uprising.we need to prevent more homelessness first\s then triage... \swe have tons of commercial real estate that is empty\s\s some homeless need rehab and serious medical help \s\sthat is the real reason they do not help the homeless ... it is expensive to help the hard core ones \s so cancel rent now to prevent further homelessnessWell how else are we going to stop China aggression in South *China* Sea?Country is too large no autonomy. \s\sMany Canadian provinces gave stimulus and bonuses why can’t states do the same? Circumvent the DC politics.They claim they’re too poor.We replace them all with an army of Berniecrats.\s\sPart #1 Defund every company that gives any Republican or Dem money.  We cut the Achilles’ tendon. Stop giving even $1 to companies supporting Republicans and Dems. \s\sPart #2 Run a Berniecrat against all of them. Force them waste money defending a thousand ant bites.  Drain their time energy and money. Break them.  We keep winning and never stop grinding. Run 10 people in every big city attack relentlessly and then consolidate forces and fold our candidates into one candidate and staff. We win by sheer force of will. We annihilate them. We bankrupt them. We stomp the the Republican and Democratic party into dust. \s\sPart #3 We rebrand what we stand for and educate the people on how spending on people super charges the economy.  We show how it’s working in other developed nations.\s\sWe take the Senate the House governorships Mayorships school boards city commissions.  Once we have the law (Senate) and the purse (House) we fix this broken country. We grind them to dust. We crush the dual political empire. We end them all.Nothing wrong with living under the bridge or going to work corners...dine all that for well over twenty years.This is literally what Andrew Yang has been campaigning for since 2017!!!\s\sWhere was the support during the primaries? Bernie supporters attacked UBI calling it a trojan horse to gut the safety net (it wasn't) saying landlords will just raise rent and it will cause inflation (the Fed just printed 3+ trillion dollars that largely went to the rich). Bernie himself expressly rejected UBI in favor of a federal jobs guarantee during the primaries. Yang was begging him to endorse UBI.> ~~Bernie supporters~~ **people** attacked UBI.To be honest I supported either one of themHere's my question there's 328 Million Americans.  \sWhy does every single American need $2000?  \s\s22 Million underemployed. Who aren't getting assistance. \s\s12 Million Unemployed. Who are receiving assistance plus $300 additional weekly.  \s\s\s\s I don't need the $600. I want the people who are underemployed to receive targeted assistance. Everyone else seems to be okay otherwise.  \s\sDon't down vote or get angry I want to have some dialogue over this point. Maybe learn something. I am not convinced EVERY single American needs $2000. I understand it would be half the cost of our military budget.>Why does every single American need $2000?\s\sIt phases out at 75k for singles and 150k for couples. A simple 5 minutes of research could have told you this.maybe Bernie can donate one of his three houses?(read this guy's recent history for insight into a deflated bag of braggadocio)Ah this tired rebuttal yet again.\s\sOne is his home in Vermont where he is from. The State he represents in the Senate.\s\sOne is a condo in D.C. because he works in D.C. and needs a residence there.\s\sOne is a tiny little cottage bought by his wife with money that came from selling her parent's home that she inherited after they passed away.\s\s\s&nbsp;\s\sI do feel the need to thank you for your brave sacrifice. It's quite obvious that you donated your brain to science long ago and it is not your fault that they misplaced it.“We just gotta get Trump out then everything will be fine.”All the problems are the result of a man that was President for 4 years. His predecessors left him with a country that was united and prosperous. All he did was raise nearly 10 million out of poverty by putting millions of Americans back to work. You can tell he was hated by the record numbers of minorities and Americans that voted for him in the 2020 election Democrats rigged to their advantage. The Democrats will now save us with a 15.00 minimum wage and guaranteed government jobs for blacks paying 15.00 to start health and retirement benefits and paid vacations and sick days as is being proposed. The back bone of the US economy small businesses of course will be a thing of the past and prices will increase along with taxes to pay for it all but that will make it better.The 1% runs both parties and each tells the 99% that the *other* party is responsible for their worsening conditions. Then the 99% fight each other instead of seeing the bigger picture and rectifying 1% tyranny. It is indeed a brilliant two-headed religion held in place mostly by the 99%'s indoctrinated fear of ""worse"" the media (owned and operated by the 1%) and historical normalization (mass apathy and learned helplessness).It's even worse in that they've made sure that one party is clearly better than the other one. There's a reason Bernie was able to run as a democrat and a reason why it would have been absurd to run as a republican. \s\sIf they were both equally bad nobody could be faulted or guilted into just abstaining. But you're almost forced into voting for the lesser of the two evils whehich ends up being not much less evil.Rotating villains.We’ve been stuck here for decades and I’m tired of itSocialism is even older. Countries with dictators and kings were socialist for hundreds of years. Capitalism came about when free countries came into existence. The US was never intended to be a system of political  parties. That came about when the party that is now the Democrats wanted to distort the Constitution and form a strong central government and divided people by race and class with only white men having the freedoms in the Constitution and were pro-slavery. They still divide people into groups. The Republicans believed in the ideals of the Constitution that all men were created equal including blacks and were anti-slavery and believed in a limited central government as the Constitution called for. Democrats are still some what the same today believing blacks are inferior and can not make it on their own without the help of a strong and powerful central federal government.In the United States the top 10% own 88% of all the wealth[1]. The top 1% have more wealth the bottom 90%[ 2]. 61% of Americans don't have $1000 dollars[3]. 40% of Americans don't have $400 dollars[4]. 78% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck[5]. 50% of Americans take home less than $35000 a year[6] (adjusted ONLY for inflation: $29852.28 in 2010 $23574.51 in 2000 and $17893.08 in 1990). The income for the bottom 80% of Americans are actually falling[7]. Before the pandemic 12.0% of student loans are in default 10.0% are in forbearance and 9.8% are in deferment[8]. Only 61% of college students graduate in 6 years (25% if private for-profit)[9]. There are 1.6 trillion dollars of student loan debt[10]. The systems failing. No healthcare for working class no power in Texas because profits are more important no stimulus checks unemployment unable to pay for months etc.  \s\sThe systems failing and it's all do with capitalism. Profit over people: capitalism. When did it fail? That's irrelevant - we need to fix it NOW. To protect human rights and the environment capitalism needs to be regulated - and when regulations continuously fail... History says revolution. \s\s\s\sCitations:\s\s1 - https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/10/08/top-1-of-us-households-hold-15-times-more-wealth-than-bottom-50-combined/\s\s2- https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/nations-top-1-percent-now-have-greater-wealth-than-the-bottom-90-percent/\s\s3 - https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/41-percent-of-americans-would-be-able-to-cover-1000-dollar-emergency-with-savings.html\s\s4 - https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=63253846 (2019)\s\s5 - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html\s\s6 - https://www.newsweek.com/half-american-workers-made-less-35000-2019-report-shows-1539503\s\s7 - https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/\s\s8 - https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/student-loan-debt-and-repayment/\s\s9 - https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40\s\s10 - https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/less-than-11percent-of-people-with-federal-student-loans-are-paying-during-covid-19-.html\s\sInformation is power. Don't hesitate to share.Rich vs poor.  That’s itThe rich want the poor dead. That's it.It's different degrees of ""villain rotation"" but behind the scenes they're all part of the same big corrupt club.They might have on different colors but the Home and Away jerseys are still on the same team.While this is true it's hardly a uniquely American concept/problem as it exists in most first-past-the-post electoral systems. E.g. sure the UK has representation of several parties in parliament but the vast majority are Labour or Conservative as are all recent PMs. And in Canada they have a fairly robust third party the truly social democratic NPD but they too have never had a PM and therefore never truly get to set the agenda. Now obviously these countries take better care of their citizens but that's more an indictment of certain antidemocratic features in the USA constitution (mostly the Senate) that favor the opinions of the elite. And of course even the other countries at the end of the day are capitalist systems with a lot of labor exploitation and environmental degradation it's just the extent to which their governmental systems allow to opinions of voters to influence policy outcomes.For this country to survive we need to have 3+ parties. The 2 party system is tearing this country apart.The only ones opposed to this are blue and red I wonder why?A third party to do what exactly? Be coopted and owned by the oligarchy and their elites? Will this party be pro-capitalism? Anyways.  U can check out the people’s party tho. But I’m skeptical of their values as most leadership works for or rides with Dems...deeply not just superficially.Did some ""proud democrats"" visit this thread to say ""HOW DARE YOU?!?!?!?"" ?1 party system with two branches.The rich 1% against the people.https://twitter.com/garfxist/status/1362835238791995393Smartest thing Peter Griffin's ever said.Sure do enjoy reading this in peter griffin's voiceWe need to end the two party system and implement rank choice voting. Two parties just trying to be random grab bags of views opposite of the other major party doesn't / can't / won't properly represent 330 million people and they don't even try. If Trump makes his own party and the 45% of Republicans who claimed they'd leave the gop for the Trump party do so there could be an opening for the green party or the dsa to become a serious challenger.Not even ranked choice voting will solve the problem unfortunately. Just look at Australia. They’ve had RCV for a long time and yet their government is not radically different than ours. The government does not reflect the will of the people.\s\sNot saying it couldn’t maybe help a little bit. But it is far from the complete solution some tout it as. The real solutions are far more radical and pose a much greater challenge to become realized but nonetheless they are what needs to be done. Things like abolishing the CIA and other “intelligence agencies” wealth caps banning supragovernmental think tanks like the CFR and Trilateral Commission and ultimately abolition of the republic and implementation of direct democracy. \s\sObviously we will never be allowed to have a vote that empowers the people to do any of the above through electoral means. Change has to come from outside the system by millions of people refusing to continue to play by the rules of the establishment.Yes but over 65% of americans want a 3 party system so it's not really going over anybody's heads everybody is aware. Its like if you blatantly do what you're not supposed to you aren't tricking people they just cant do anything about it.We certainly *can* do something about it. It's just a matter of adding to the recognition of the problem a sense of urgency about fixing it.The two-party scheme is repeated in virtually every major western country. \s\sParis and London.global oligarchy\s\sbillionaires don't have an allegiance to a country. Only to their bank accounts.The Merchant class eventually secured rule of the nations.

You think that the international critics of the last few hundred years of capitalism were just trolling with baseless claims?? And never forget The American Political system was established by capitalist oligarchs. And has since been intensified. I hope you enjoy crises because the new paradigm is crisis time.At least with one party certain members of Congress hold fundraisers to help a little when capitalism runs amok.What happens when civilization collapses because of capitalism-caused climate change? https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/lqzlm7/attenborough_we_face_the_collapse_of_everything/\s\sNone of this is going to matter. There will be no political system. There will be no capitalism. Just chaos death and destruction.\s\sMaybe AOC will hold some fundraisers.....It's sort of best described as a burning sinking ship the lifeboats are gone the lower classes are locked down below and all anyone can think to do is take joy in the others suffering (you know good state bad state) blaming the people they don't like for the state of things without anybody thinking to consider maybe setting the boat on fire and setting off to sea with no lifeboats wasn't a good system of travel.Well there's a good chance a third party is coming with Trump Republicans splintering off.  Saw a poll the other day that almost 50% of Republicans would support a Trump third party.that just means Reps will struggle with how to appeal to ""those people"" thus to keep them within its confines.  the Chamber of Commerce class was able to make an alliance with the damned Evangelists.  so why not the tRUMPistas?\s\sthe Reps looked like they were going to meldmerge with the Dems over the Capital hoohaa but they relish their importance and roles too much to give it up entirely.I am trying to help build Reform party which is a moderate party. I have been trying to capture a lot of the disenfranchised people from the left and the right. \s\sI really like that this party has the belief that no one party should have a deciding majority that we should be working as a coalition that the barriers to entry for new parties and new candidates should be low and that money should be unlinked from electability.There won't be a Third Party spit. Trump will be running the Republican Party for years to come McConnell's faction will lose and they will get even crazier. \s\sThat is because the Republicans only opposition to their policies is politically powerless and the 'fake opposition' Democratic Shit Liberals are their business partners.\s\sThe Republicans will be back in charge of Congress in 2022 simply because the Democrats are circular firing squad who can't even deliver on $2000 checks and $15 minimum wage. \s\sThe Republicans' policies are crap but their political tactics are brilliant compared to the feckless lazy useless spineless  shit-eating worthless corrupt losers known as the Democratic Party.r/RanktheVoteYepIt was an organic develpoment that grew up alongside the development of capitalism in the USA not a top-down scheme imposed by some nefarious political class. Let's be realistic in how we approach history.'Organic development'\s\sAs if money plays no part in the perpetuation of the fake two-party system.> ...not a top-down scheme imposed by some nefarious political class.\s\sLOL.  Dude.  Our entire system was a top-down scheme imposed from the very start by the bourgeoisie and their puppet bureaucrats and coded right into the constitution and other legal and economic foundations of society.  You'd have to be living under a fucking rock and stuffing wads toilet paper in your ears continuously to not realize this.  Did you get your ""history"" straight from good ol' PragerU or something?  Whew!That's an assumption.It can be both. This is largely the natural result of capitalism but let's not pretend it wasn't accelerated by the wealthy owners / operators of both parties.Let's be realistic: Citizens United.\s\sEdit: I misunderstood the original post. This person is correct - I am keeping the original for context to the responses. Citizens United was decided in 2010 and has very little to do with development but rather far more to do with today's modern ruling class.It organically developed as a result of the people in power benefiting more from letting the system break than fixing it.Your approach to USA history is nonsensical. The American Political system was established by capitalist oligarchs. And has since been intensified. I hope you enjoy crises because the new paradigm is crisis time.Nope it was not invented by capitalism when political factions predate America. Corruption is a problem of excess human greed.>excess human greed\s\sCapitalism explained in one phrase.Your statement seems to assume that America invented “capitalism”. This is false https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalismIt’ll not failIt's already failed. It doesn't protect the people. The point of any government is to protect it's people - and the US government can't do that. When will it fall - that's the question. Will the 1% realize the inequality they've great is too much and start to protect the people - or will the 99% realize first?What the blank does capitalism have to do with the 2 party system and when the blank did it fail?When the penalty of a crime is a fine it's only a crime for the poor.It’s failing[deleted]Okay CommieThink this says more about you than people criticising the system. It's not either or. \s\sUS can continue under the current mixed society without going full blown communism; the solution to duopoly doesn't have to be abolishing democracy altogether. More political parties and more de-programming people from Vote Blue/Red No Matter What zombie electorialism would also solve the problemOk sophomore.Bernie is not good for the dems' corporate masters.Take a look at the coordinated effort to smear mislabel and discredit him online and how massive it is. Yang is very clearly hitting a sore spot NeoLiberals can't stand to see.Anything that goes outside the party channels will be attacked by the parties. \s\sThe party requires opposition so the other party is a party.  They share power as long as they both exist in a vacuum.  \s\sSo they protect each other from the people and from any other party.  \s\sIt’s is the same kind of vested interest advantage that all vested interests purchase for themselves once they have enough power.  \s\sIt’s time it stopped but you know people suck.Is it consensus amongst the mainstream Dems at this point that they also did it in 2020? The fact that Kamala is vice president and Buttigieg is SoT suggests there is merit to the theory. Pete and Amy dropped out while Warren stayed in to hurt Bernie right before Super Tuesday. Biden got the Obama/Kamala endorsement right on time and with everybody else out Biden became the de facto nominee even though Bernie was leading.Didn't yang also endorse Biden?Near as I can tell it was more backstabbing media collusion and back room dirty dealing in 2020 as opposed to balls-out fraud like in 2016.  The only obvious exception being the handling of the Iowa caucus results.  They weren't even being coy there the Buttigieg-aligned company that tallied the results was called Shadow Inc.>The fact is the Dems should have let Bernie and Hillary go at it fair and square in 2016 which Bernie probably wins. And Bernie probably beats Trump in ‘16. The Democratic Party sometimes has very anti-democratic impulses.\s\s> Do the failings of the Democratic Party have something to do with the rise of Trump? Sure. Will they change tacks in ‘24?  Probably not.The Democratic Party feared a Bernie presidency.\s\sIf Clinton won the Democratic Party keeps doing their thing.\s\sWhen Trump won the Democratic Party kept doing their thing.\s\sIf Bernie won he would have turned around and gutted the Democratic Party.  That's what they didn't want.  That's why Hillary's win was engineered.absolutely right.  Not only that Bernie threatened the entire status quo and the codependent relationship between Establishment Dems and Republicans.What do you mean by ""gutted""?Funny thing is that Trump did the exact same thing to the Republicans and it was accepted with open arms. \s\sGotta remember this country doesn't just *lean* right it basically embraces it.No. Not true.Finally Yang says something. Why the ""mainstream"" are always slow to the news.They say it when it no longer matters. He'll change his tune later on this year.Yang's happy to speak up now that saying anything won't threaten establishment power.  He's speaking now to garner credibility with the kind of people he wants to sell out against in later election cycles.\s\sRemember when Yang dropped out to endorse Biden and take a CNN anchoring job?Ok but he still folded under Biden[deleted]be careful I have been banned from two subs just for linking a news story about Kamala. Saying anything negative about her makes you a racist sexist.She's almost a blue Sarah PalinI think Ron desantis will run for the Republicans and win their vote. Maybe trump but I think the Republican Party won’t want him to represent them after January 6th[Bernie Would Have Won](https://youtu.be/moNHfeBJ81I)One of the more interesting “what-if’s” for me is if Bernie ran as an independent in 2016. Sure it would’ve handed the election to Trump but he won anyways. It seems to me that this would have at least formed a voting bloc to be reckoned with which could have actually driven change within the Democratic Party.I forgot Yang after the Biden endorsement but BlueMaga's pretty angry over this and I think that's just great 😃If Bernie won would they make more money? I don't think so. Hillary was essential for them whether she won or lost.Ok now do 2020Primary was rigged.\s\sThey screwed Bernie and Yang out of a fair chance.\s\sIf they had a fair primary Biden still might have won. Even if my preferred candidate didn’t win I would have been ok with it.\s\sThat’s not what happened.\s\sEdit: Tulsi tooThe Democratic Party is corrupt beyond repair I think. Bernie wasn't playing along as much as they wanted. He still endorsed Hillary but that wasn't enough for them. They need someone who is a 100% puppet. Biden is very good at thatSaid the man who ran against Sanders in 2020 and endorsed Biden after dropping out.He didnt endorse anybody until it was mathematically impossible for anyone to beat BidenUnless Biden finds a way to actually do something Trump is def gonna win in 2024. The Dems are too weak to actually try to charge Trump criminally.If they were wise they’d have Biden announce that he wont run for re-election and rig their own primaries in favor of a Elizabeth Warren type candidate that is a politician that has the policies and platitudes of Bernie while still softening the rhetoric for the older crowd who still see Socialism as a dirty word. I wouldn’t like it and they’d still be in the pockets of the DNC and corrupt as hell but that’s their best move for 2024. \s\sI don’t think Biden can win a re-election unless the Republicans completely shatter or fuck up by forcing a bad imitation of Donald Trump.Why do socialists align with the DNC? All that happens is they parade them around saying ""see we're the tolerant class."" Then tell them to sit in the corner.Don't rig it. That's what lost Bernie in 2016. Let the people speak.He has a good point but where was Yang when he was helping bamboozle Bernie in 2020 to help make sure they nominated Biden before Bernie could mow him down in more primaries?\s\sDon't. Trust. Yang. More. Than. You. Can. Throw. Him.Ooof I forgot about that. That being said Yang is right about one thing a populist is what America needed. You had Bernie and Trump two populists. The moment they rug pulled Bernie installing an establishment candidate the populist won.\s\s**This isn’t a fight between democrats and republicans this is a fight between populism versus establishment (status quo).** I just hope that in the midterms more populists get voted in and the establishment incumbents are primaried out. \s\sReddit used to be about the little guy but has quickly become pro-establishment with all the China bucks. \s\sPopulist movements work it worked in 2016 a populist broke the establishment I’d be happy with a 2024 populist....dropping out for a CNN gig lol.  Yang is such a piece of shit who wants in to the fold so badly.I don't think he's skinny either.I don't hate Yang but this is the same guy who officially endorsed Biden over Sanders when he withdrew from the election. He's not really in a place to talk.Yeah he's full of it.  Saying this in January of 2022 is useless.  Where was he when it could have made a difference?  Same place as Warren.yup ran straight to CNN and started sharing ""his math"" on how Biden was the only choice completely sold out.Wasn’t that part of the agreement everyone needed to sign? Tulsi did the same thing.He was blackballed from doing it by the democratic party (... is my theory). Look what they did to Tulsi Gabbard this election and look who she supported in 2016. If Yang wanted to run again he had to endorse Biden but it sucks you're right.It's amazing how he talks about as if it wasn't total corruption and brutality dictating those events...As much as Trump is a POS the Dems need to also take accountability and purge their bad apples a large groups of Dems are going to vote third party and I think for the first time they might actually get it done \s\sOne good thing about my generation is we generate a lot of momentum in the polls but one things for sure we need to get rid of scumbags in our party>we need to get rid of scumbags in our party\s\sLitterally most federal dems. \s\sI don't see it happening. The establishment wins by disenfranchising voters. There are people who will never vote again because of Biden. They didn't vote for Joe Manchin as president and now realize the farce that is american democracy.> one things for sure we need to get rid of scumbags in our party\s\sIt will never happen.\s\sChanging the party from within is never going to happen.It was accomplished with one phone call.  Still pisses me off.[deleted]Damn. Never thought of that one. If the Yang with good instincts had been Bernie's VP that would have been a very interesting WH...Not impressed by Yang. He will never get a dime from me.Money for what? Isn’t he just a talking head now?NahAndrew Yang's appearance on Ben Shapiros Sunday show got me out of my right wing conservative bubble. Love him!That was civil as hell. As different as they are I feel like Ben and Andrew would get along as people.Good for you man. More people need to do this. I saw Shapiro on Joe Rogan and thought he handled himself well. While I mostly disagree with the man he did make some valid points.His interview on Rogan plus the endorsement also had a huge impactOK but fuck Andrew Yang.  He is saying this now because his credibility is in the trash.  He shouldn't have ran in 2020 and should have supported Sanders.  This guy is a *huge* grifter.It's the ""sometimes has"" that causes me to roll my eyes and stop caring what he does or says.\s\sStill wanting the inside track.\s\sDems are corrupt and rig elections widely. Often.\s\sIf he cannot or WILL not say that then he is playing inside their lines and corruptible too.I never saw any proof the elections were rigged...Jeez talk about being nitpicky.\s\sYou do realize that not even Bernie Sanders himself has ever said that?Andrew yang… grifter like the rest.  Did he pledge to donate his POTUS salary i wonder?  Ooooooor. Was he just another pocket filler?  \s\sWhy do people fall for the obvious shitbags.Democrats are no better than Republicans. They obstruct real change.\s\sThey prevent any challenge to Republicans.\s\sNever vote blue. Never vote red. Elections and voting are a  distraction.If you spend very little time thinking about elections and don’t let them distract you from the real work that has to be done why not vote blue? Makes people’s lives marginally better in the short term (not by enough but better); plus if Democrats have power and still fail (as they always do) it radicalizes normies very quickly. Biden’s failing to deal with Covid has done more to radicalize my very liberal parents than anything else. If Trump were still president I know they’d just blame him.I often wonder about how 2016 would have gone if the DNC hadn't shafted Bernie. He would certainly have had my vote.\s\sOn the other hand I preferred Trump to HRC any day.It's the reason I don't consider myself a democrat anymore. I don't know what I am anymoreShort of the Trump campaign pulling an enormous scandal out of their hat that the Clintons couldn't find Sanders absolutely would have won in 2016.  Assuming he made good on his pledges and was aggressive with the holdouts in Congress the US would have been entering the pandemic with the fledgling Medicare for All having just got off the ground a much higher minimum wage an essentially eliminated student debt burden a somewhat (not hugely) reduced military presence overseas freeing up resources for dealing with disaster domestically and a lot of fresh faces in a potentially energized House and Senate because a bunch of them would have been torn to pieces in primaries for being little shitheads trying to rob the public of healthcare.\s\sSounds like a fairy tale but if Sanders did what he said he would do and the enthusiastic support didn't suddenly dry up the country would be a massively different place.  I'll never forgive the Democrats for deliberately choosing to kill tens of thousands of Americans year on year for the sake of Clinton's vanity instead.Same.  Hillary was CLEARLY the greater evil.Unfortunately Yang will probably say something shitty tomorrow. Every time Yang says something good he disappoints you the next day by saying something bad.Could you elaborate by any chances please.  \s\sHe was absolutely silenced during the last elections wasn't given a fair platform during the debates.. had a very big following. I do think their manifesto is insanely detailed and forward thinking - read it all. \s\sAre we really shying away from people because of a few shitty posts.. worse..possoble fair statements you disagree with..It's OK to disagree with a leaders stance ..not everything a party stands for is going to represent you 100% of the time.. ever.Couldn't agree more.. I commented on a post here a whole back about how absolutely stupid and a dick move it was for Bernie to step down and ask voters to support Biden. \s\sWhat an absolute cop out.. I know intentions were good. But really what he was saying was.. I'm still a lapdog even though I want freedom peace and liberty for all. \s\sHonestly I wish he was running again.. I really do. \s\sTrump is going to win it.. let be honest. You'd have to be silly to bet against Trump when the democrats are in such a mess and Biden .. omg.. let's not even go there. 😥Trump had his own fans booing him for recommending the vaccine 2 months ago.

Because women don't fight in wars.\s\sThey thought it was ""okay"" Hillary's biggest backers were wall street banks.\s\sWhy? Because corruption is more acceptable to the DNC than Sanders.\s\sAndrew yang is totally on point.Women actually suffer more from war because they lose husbands and sons.Yo u/sexydoordasherdude do you have any sexy door dash stories to share with us> Clinton girls\s\sThose were the PUMAs and like the acronym implies Dem party loyalty went out the window - I can respect them for that.The Democrats aren't democratic.

What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism! But more of this later.\s\sThis is an excellent quote that applies to so many things right now\s\sFor example the stereotypical ""reddit socialist"" that case more about ""ableism"" than material conditionsCan we do a larger discussion on this? I find this book fascinating. \s\sFinally I have found something that articulates why I find the concept of the ""Tyranny of the majority"" so repugnant.Andrew is a little slow on the uptake.Right he’s basically stating the obvious to anyone who has a brain at this point. \s\sI still appreciate it thoughHe’s just pivoting to a new business model for himself. Even if he is correct.Thing is if Bernie is still unable/unwilling to call out the rampant election fraud in the system he stands no chance of ever winning. They cheated both times the first time was so brazen it makes my stomach churn. The second time he made enough mistakes that it wasn’t as obvious. But both times he did not stick up for himself or his base so I have a hard time believing he’ll ever get in the White House at this point.Dem donor Lloyd Blankfein said he would support Joe Biden in 2020 but he and his class would support Donald Trump if Bernie Sanders or anyone like Bernie Sanders got the nomination.\s\sI wonder how Mr. Yang reconciles this with his comments about the ""Democratic Party.""  Maybe he was unaware found it insignificant thinks there's any way to not support the interests of Goldman-Sachs Raytheon Citi Pfizer Exxon/Mobile Comcast etc.\s\sNo Mr. Yang please continue. You were saying?Yang is talking about 2016. Bernie won the unDemocratic Party primaries in 2016 he just wasn’t declared the winner due to the rampant and numerous election fraud committed by the party to get the “win” for Hillary.\s\sTPTB were shocked at Bernie’s movement and Trump was in 2016 reviled by the official Republican Party that I think Bernie would have beaten Trump because I’m not certain that TPTB wanted Trump anywhere near the WH as the whole Russiagate was created to control him. Trump was/still is a loose cannon and if the alternative was Bernie they (TPTB) might have been more comfortable that  Bernie was an experienced enough politician and he DID vote for military interventions (  TPTB only care about that because when Trump acted against Venezuela even Democrats liked him ). So yeah in 2016 Bernie could/would have beaten Trump. \s\sNow 2020 is a different matter because Trump actually had grown his base of rabid supporters that TPTB had to use election fraud to install Biden. \s\sBut 2016 was different. It was a sea change election and the American people were denied.Posing this fact as a question is weak. \s\sThe failure of the Democratic Party caused the rise of Trump. They will not change in 2024. \s\sTrump or another fascist will be elected in 2024 again because of the failure of the Democratic party.\s\sDemocrats destroy democracy.U don’t know these as facts. They are supposition and speculation not absolutes.Bout damn time someone attacked the Dem establishmentSpeaking as a conservative I don't agree with Yang but I do believe he acts in good faith and believes most of his public positions. I didn't particularly like many of the democratic primary candidates but he was one of my two favorites because he seemed to have fleshed out ideas.His UBI idea was not flushed out. I heard that and instantly didn’t want to hear anything else he said.When he raised his hand with everyone else on stage for ""universal healthcare of illegal immigrants"" he lost me.\s\sAt least with UBI there is an economic argument even if I disagree with him. But Yang pandered when he could have stood out.GOP wants to end democracy DNC wants to manage itGop is not against all democratic process\sDnc doesn't understand democracyI’m libertarian-ish and I second this 🙋🏼‍♀️Yang is a loser crybaby though. ""I'll just go make my own Democrat party!""To be fair the Democratic party is a graveyard for progressives so abandoning them is a good idea.Soooo much easier to speak the truth when it doesn't cost ya anything right Andrew?And Bernie broke my heart when he endorsed Hillary after he dropped out in 2016.Is he insinuating that Bernie or his family was held at gunpoint unless he told the truth about Assange and the rigging? Unless that’s true then fuck Yang and fuck Bernie even more for playing along with Democrats. Hell even if it is true fuck ‘em.[One Good Shot against the establishment. ](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/dmw1zi/you_get_one_good_shot_at_the_establishment/) Then they either turn you  or burn you. \s\sSame applies for Trump.Bernie would not have beaten Trump in ‘16. Also democrats don’t want Bernie Sanders as president lolHe would have won. Many anti-establishment voters especially in the rust belt that went to Trump just to despise Hillary would have voted for him.The only reason Bernie wouldn't have won is the same reason he didn't win: because his own party sabotaged him in favor of literally anybody else.All the polls had Bernie beating Trump by 10+ points. Some as high as 15. \s\sThose polls were wrong!\s\sNope. Those same polls remarkably predicted Hillary's popular vote margin over Trump. Say it with me. Bernie would have won!Unfortunately I agree with you. Too many reactionary hogs on both sides. The Republicans would have played the defense against socialism card hard.However if Hillary - who actually won the popular vote if you recall - had taken office oversaw a booming economy acted prudently and decently with domestic and foreign policies and dealt swiftly and decisively with the pandemic she would be in her second term right now and people would hardly remember Yang as anything but a recently failed candidate for NYC Mayor. Spouting convenient ‘what-ifs’ for cheap applause doesn’t erase the Trump years and what it’s done to this country regardless of how one feels about the Democratic Party.> if Hillary - who actually won the popular vote\s\sHillary’s winning the popular vote is as irrelevant now as it was in 2016 became popular vote is not how the US chooses Presidents.   However the Electoral College  usually agrees with the popular vote except in cases of very close elections.  The factj that the popular vote was as close as it was only highlights what a wretched candidate Hillary was given that ahe was running against an imbecile like Donald Trump.   And yet the DNC and nearly every superdelegate insisted time and again that Hillary was a fantastic candidate.  My Senator endorsed Hillary for President in 2014 for fuck’s sake long before Hillary even declared.  \s\s>had taken office oversaw a booming economy acted prudently and decently with domestic and foreign policies and dealt swiftly and decisively with the pandemic she would be in her second term right now\s\sThat’s a big If because 1. Hillary was so horrible she lost the election to Donald fucking Trump 2.  Hillary has shown time and again that she has awful judgement which was certainly not going to change once she got her hands back on the reins of power.   I mean Hillary said that she supported a no-fly zone over Syria at a time when Russian planes were flying over Syria.  A no-fly zone would likely have started a hot war with Russia.  Moreover she also said that cyberattacks should be met with a military response and Hillary made it quite clear that she believed that Russia had hacked the DNC server and released the party’s emails.   I expected a war with Russia during her first term.  So saying that Hillary would be in her second term after governing prudently and decently is patently absurd.  Hillary has never been prudent nor decent.  She is and was an openly corrupt warmongering pathological liar.>acted prudently and decently with domestic and foreign policies\s\sHillary ""Henry Kissinger is my beloved mentor"" Clinton?\s\sHillary ""Single-payer healthcare will never ever happen"" Clinton?Bernie wouldn't have beaten Trump.Perhaps not but at least that while still leaving us at square one would mean the DNC is acting slightly ‘democratic’ and isn’t rigging primariesTrump was always Clinton's stooge.

But Sanders chairman of the Senate budget committee and one of the nation’s most prominent progressive voices said **“People can understand that you sometimes don’t have the votes. But they can’t understand why we haven’t brought up important legislation that 70 or 80% of the American people support.”**\s\s>Sanders spoke to the Guardian on 6 January **the same day he issued a statement that the best way to safeguard our democracy is not just to enact legislation that protects voting rights but to address the concerns of “the vast majority of Americans” for whom “there is a disconnect between the realities of their lives and what goes on in Washington”.**\s\s>He said millions of Americans were concerned with such “painful realities” as “low wages dead-end jobs debt homelessness lack of healthcare”. **In that statement he said many working-class Americans have grown disaffected with the political system because “nothing changes” for them “or if it does it’s usually for the worse”.**\s\s>In the interview Sanders repeatedly said that Democrats need to demonstrate vigorously and visibly that they’re fighting to improve the lives of working-class Americans. “The truth of the matter is people are going to work and half of them are living paycheck to paycheck” Sanders said. “People are struggling with healthcare with prescription drugs. Young families can’t afford childcare. Older workers are worried to death about retirement.”\s\s[snip]\s\s>Sanders voiced frustration with the lack of progress on Biden’s Build Back Better legislation which the Democrats sought to enact through budget reconciliation a process that requires only a simple majority to pass. That effort was slowed by lengthy negotiations with the centrist senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona – and then blocked when Manchin said he opposed the $2tn package sparking leftwing fury and deep frustration in the White House.\s\s>**“We have tried a strategy over the last several months which has been mostly backdoor negotiations with a handful of senators” Sanders said. “It hasn’t succeeded on Build Back Better or on voting rights. It has demoralized millions of Americans.”**\s\s>**He called for reviving a robust version of Build Back Better and also called for holding votes on individual parts of that legislation that would help working-class Americans. “We have to bring these things to the floor” Sanders said.** “The vast majority of people in the [Democratic] caucus are willing to fight for good policy.”\s\s>**Sanders added: “If I were Senator Sinema and a vote came up to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs I’d think twice if I want to get re-elected in Arizona to vote against that. If I were Mr Manchin and I know that tens of thousands of struggling families in West Virginia benefited from the expansion of the child tax credit I’d think long and hard before I voted against it.”**\s\s>Sanders also called for legislation on another issue he has championed: having Medicare provide dental vision and hearing benefits. “All these issues they are just not Bernie Sanders standing up and saying this would be a great thing” he said. “They are issues that are enormously popular and on every one of them the Republicans are in opposition. But a lot of people don’t know that because the Republicans haven’t been forced to vote on them.”\s\sYeah he's being more ""political"" about it than we are but we're saying the same things.> “If I were Senator Sinema and a vote came up to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs I’d think twice if I want to get re-elected in Arizona to vote against that.

We built the Interstate highways then a single income could support a family of 4 on the regular.\s\sWe've had trickle down for 40 years and the results have been absolutely dismal by every metric.Not taxing the rich still increases prices for the poor so let's tax them anyway yeah?When we were taxing tne shit out of the rich people could afford a modest home wife multiple kids on a single worker's pay.Because he owns Amazon stock it’s not cash. \s\sRaising minimum wage hurts the most desperate. \s\sWhy should a minimum wage worker’s salary be compared to 30 percent of the value of Amazon? \s\sThis is shamefully stupid.Here comes the Bezos Brigade with the Stocks aren't wealth bullshit like clockwork.I agree with you when people share these things about Musk and Bezos. They act like they are magically getting money if the share price drops their net worth drops. \s\sI think the thing everyone can agree on that as our nation's GDP and productivity continues to rise along with higher demands on workers then why aren't wages? \s\sPeople cite inflation and higher costs but Id argue the monetary policy of the past 15 years is more to blame for inflation. Wages stagnate and purchasing power loses value eventually we have to do something. Kicking the can down the road even further will cause the solution to be even more disruptive.  \s\sThats why ive become a bigger fan of the idea of UBI. Automate what you want cut costs and be more productive the people they will need to work there will be paid better bc they wont need to and instead chose to work and there will be less of them. Probably see bigger swaths of people starting their own businesses maybe what they would do as a side job now can be their real job to make some extra money for vacations and streaming subscriptions.  Corporate taxes will rise hurting stocks but better growth and productivity will help stocks. \s\s More people with more money to spend buying those super efficiently produced goods and services. More people not feeling like suiciding once a day. Stonks go up USA number one.How do we prevent Biden 2.0?By abolishing the oligarchy lolLOL This is impossible with Biden Pelosi and Schumer calling the shots.And to think there are people who disagree with this list... Quite the world we live in.> And to think there are people who disagree with this list...\s\sIncluding the new administration.Biden *is* Trump 2.0. We are in a unrecoverable downward spiral.Think higher.\s\sIt's time to build a new ConstitutionBiden admin to US citizens: Fuck you peasants. You get nothing. We just promised things to get elected. Psyche!The most simple reasonable list but so many people are against it.I disagree with number one. There are plenty of people who have 2-6 due to number 1 but the problem is their job is pointless and so creates mental distress for these individuals. If a job is mandatory for all persons than we will create so many tedious pointless soul crushing positions in the economy just to satisfy some pre industrial revolutionary morality that no longer applies to modern living.  \s\sI would truly love a UBI because it would remove from the workforce a whole host of idiots who put in zero effort in their job simply because they need it to satisfy their basic human needs of shelter and food. Plenty of people would happily stay in the labour force in a field they take joy from toiling in and quality of work would go up due to better mindset of workers.This touches on a good point.\s\sIn modern society we could almost completely replace human physical labor with automated production. In a couple of decades it's possible we'll be able to replace the majority of all jobs with the help of AI meaning that the majority of people will have no job.\s\sIn any other universe this would be a utopian dream. In ours it's a dystopian nightmare. Instead of celebrating that the necessity of labor has been dramatically reduced people either *avoid* automation entirely or they obsess about reverse engineering a demand for a new type of job so that they can justify giving people a liveable wage instead of you know just giving it to them.\s\sThis is your brain on capitalism.Go back to Russia you dirty commie!FDR managed to get point 5 pushed through albeit with sweeping exclusions (which have to some extent been remedied since). \s\sLBJ got point 4 partially answered (for those over 65 and not without key omissions).\s\sGiven the extreme changes in employment due to the advances of automation (something that was barely on the horizon back in FDR's day) it would be possible to combine points 1 and 2 with ""An adequate Universal Basic Income"".\s\sPoints 3 and 6 still need work....We need to govern this country so everyone has a good lifePrevent it? We're trying to prevent populist movements now?Here's where someone points out that AOC is a big liar not just about M4A but also about $15 minimum wage.

All talk no results.[deleted]Everyone but the billionaires hording assets benefits as minimum wage workers put 100% of their income back into the economy.  Small business would likely benefit the 2nd most.And minimum wage drives up expectations for the next tier of pay as well.Remember when Republicans wanted to get people off welfare?https://www.epi.org/publication/why-america-needs-a-15-minimum-wage/Reports: This is misinformation.\s\s[Seems like the vote did pass.](https://www.dw.com/en/berliners-vote-yes-on-property-expropriation-but-what-happens-now/a-59070328)\s\sThere is a question of how to go about it legally but the tweet is correct information.Yes. It was a non-binding referendum though. As the subhead to the headline of the article at your link points out:\s\s>A referendum proposing that authorities in Berlin seize and take into public ownership more than 200000 homes has passed resoundingly. But political and legal hurdles mean it may never become reality.The tweet is a good case for r/technicallythetruth all the senate has to do now is debate over the issue and cast a vote so it is not anywhere near the strong example of direct democracy the tweet implies it to beStart with abandoned buildings and lots condemned buildings that are not repaired in a timely manner and foreclosures on real estate companies that aren't paying real estate taxes. Build and rehab as needed creating jobs. \s\sAdditionally one form of public private partnerships of which I approve:  As a condition of building or condo conversion require developers to provide in their apartment and condo buildings over a specified size some units of affordable housing. This also avoids creating pockets and stigma though both are preferable to homelessness. (Restrictions on subletting of the apartments and resale of the condos are necessary to keep the units affordable.) If compensation is required it can be giving in the form of an appropriate break in real estate taxes for a time.it's a non-binding resolution that solves nothingThank you.  This post is so misleading.ITT:  REEEEEE MUH REAL ESTATE SPECULATION! REEEEEEE!""Volksentscheide"" are not binding in any way apart from the Senate having to consult on that. This time it's about the big apartment companies last time it was whether Tempelhof should be used to build apartments - people voted to not build there and a year after the decision top politicians already announced that the city could not afford to pass on so much land to build on. By the way the mean price Berlin got per apartment when they sold it to the very same companies was abou 8000€ back in the day. Anyways don't take this stuff too seriously as it has almost no legal consequences.Based Berlin damnSadly it was just a nonbinding referendum about whether the city state of Berlin should buy those units.Honestly the thing that helped me the most to get off the streets was Medicaid and an addiction specialist. Once I got that everything else really started to fall into place for me. I'm not saying it's not important to house homeless folks but I'm just saying that alone isn't going to solve the biggest issues for a lot of these people. \s\sI think trying to tackle the opioid epidemic installing M4A and treating drug addiction as a medical issue rather than a criminal one is really important. For a lot of people on the streets they already do qualify for Medicaid so the next important step is giving them accessible treatment. \s\sI don't think housing isn't an important part of it but I think there's other issues to address to give these people a chance at long term success. If someone has a crippling dependency and you give them a home they're likely to end up right back on the streets anyway if they haven't addressed their other problems.The sheer volume of leftists and activists that are in extreme HOSTILE denial of this absolutely basic set of real world facts about the majority of homeless worldwide in western societies is downright depressing- and getting scary because they are gaining more and more influence and power over the narrative and govt decision making.\s\sAnd it is painfully clear they will NEVER accept responsibility for the catastrophic impacts of their blind fanatical agendas.(It's only a possible forced buy-out not a seizing but it's still) awesome! Good job Berlin! Guck landlords the leeches of society. Have an uncle that works for the post office \s\sHe saved about $2 an hour for about a decade to have enough for a down payment on a duplex.

Stop the internet!  We've got misleading information on twitter.  Shut it down so we can clean up this mess.  Sorry everyone is just going to have to wait.  \s\s\sNice find SibilantSnake.It is. Tweets rarely if ever capture the nuance of the issue they purport to describe. I wish we could require posters not to use a tweet as a proxy of an actual source where that source is not linked.https://www.archpaper.com/2021/09/berlin-votes-socialize-200000-rental-properties-non-binding-referendum/Berliner here :: you understood nothing comma null. The flats „taken away from corporations „ were left NOT RENOVATED and not put up to SAFETY STANDARDS for years from corporations. Who do you think now have to spend millions to renovate?? The Berlin Senate. Corporations gladly freed themselves from a liability which the People now have to cover and the city of Berlin now it’s poorer not richer. Wake up.Is a single individual person considered “private real estate”?It's only for private real estate firms that own 3000+ apartments.Yes but that's not what the tweet is about: You left out the word ""companies."" Funny how things happen.Omg creamyweren’t those home already occupied though?\s\swhat needs to be done is building new housingIt's not an either/or scenario. BOTH need to happen.I dont care how liberal you are that's fucking theft. If they took your home to give to a homeless person you wouldn't say thus is ""based""Liberals are exactly the people that are upset by this. What do you even mean?Further you should consider:  \sMarquis de Sade in L'Histoire de Juliette 1797: ""Tracing the right of property back to its source one infallibly arrives at usurpation. However theft is only punished because it violates the right of property; but this right is itself nothing in origin but theft""  \sSo in essence you either believe that property is theft in its self or that it is somehow legitimized by the laws in which case this is a lawful transfer of property.  \s  \sBtw how do you think wealth redistribution should be done? Shall we ask the billionaires nicely to stop amassing unheard amounts of wealth?I never bothered to read the definition of private property but I will loudly shout about how Marx stole my toothbrush.No it's called eminent domain. Owning property in a country means that you are subject to the laws of that country. If eminent domain is a part of the law then you signed up for the possibility of that rule being enacted. \s\sThey should have known that before they invested. The investor is at fault for not knowing that.Those properties literally aren't anybody's homes when they're owned by real estate companies and/or sitting idle.\s\sThe homeless are literally the ones who have had their homes taken away.\s\sFor real estate companies those properties are merely commodities to sell.  For the homeless those are potential homes.Don't stand up for the morbidly wealthy to become more morbidly wealthy. That is as gross as demanding someone with suicidal ideation be given more suicidal ideation. It's dangerous and harmful.\sBesides that it can't be theft. Theft requires taking from an actual entity. This is taking from an imaginary entity. Like taking homes from Jesus and his church vs taking from the members of churches. One is using them and the other is screeching about their imaginary friend fighting his imaginary nemesis. If use is less important then ownership. You do understand that they fundamentally could not have earned them through non-exploitive means. They had to short and exploit millions of workers millions to gather enough money to support their morbid greed. That makes it a nasty modern form of usury. So if you got offended about the imaginary friend Jesus jokes you need to be furious about the usury actively being promoted in economic systems. One is a joke and the other is a rampant horrible sin so bad that Jesus lost his temper.This sounds like a good solution at first but it actually turns out to severely worsen the homelessness problem by discouraging property developers in Berlin from building any new homes in the future for fear they too will be confiscated by the government.  That limits the available housing even more so by just confiscating the homes now you’re cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Then if the government itself goes into the business of building houses you end up with unattractive government housing of poor quality that is not well maintained (think E. German Soviet-style public housing projects).  The more attractive higher-end housing will always be produced by private developers seeking high dollars.> discouraging property developers in Berlin from building any new homes\s\syou mean *big* property developers from building new right?  because owner-occupied home builders wouldn't have that worry in this context.> This is exactly how you solve the homeless crisis.\s\sConfiscation of private property is unconstitutional and will make things worse.  Civil asset forfeiture is bad enough.  Dan is praising theft by force of government but I bet he'll be singing a different tune if his house was seized by the government and given to some random homeless person.Germany's analogue to eminent domain differs from the United States' takings clause. Although I cannot speak to the nuances. Any German lawyers around?Eminent domain can be used for any thing a city wants. [Public use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London) has been defined as whatever a city says is public use even if they're taking one person's land (after paying them of course) and giving it to a private developer. So taking something for public housing would be public use and it's not even a stretch. Thank that fifth amendment for that.Ah yes this is theft but the wage theft that happens constantly at all times to all workers under capitalism isn't... because some old rich dudes decided it wasn't?cry moar we're coming for your toothbrushThe non-binding referendum seems to have been about forcing sales by companies that own more than 3000 units not about confiscation.  https://www.thejournal.ie/berlin-rental-property-5558921-Sep2021/   However I agree this is not the way to do it.This is in Germany not the US.\s\sI don't give one shit what Germany does to their own people as long as they keep their tanks parked.\s\sSeize all through private property for all I care....give it to the homeless burn it...whatever.\sAin't none of our business what other authoritarian governments do within their borders.History repeats itself maybe funny mustaches will come back too.Yes great comment!

Also tanking the housing market is great the next step is to simply criminalize rent/landlords and make public housing.It's mental health manifested as drug addiction.  If you give a homeless drug addict a house they'll sell it to get their drug.The housing market values are based on scarcity.\s\sThis move if it ever becomes actualized will certainly lower home values for the expropriated homes as well as other homes in the same market. \s\sHowever the ROI for those who can already afford single family homes is obviously not the priority in passing a law like this. Also I don't see where it says the homes will be ""given"" to the homeless?Until it’s your home they’re “seizing”.Mhm because that's what's happening primary residences are being seized and their owners kicked out to the curb. \s\sBoo hoo poor housing speculatorsAnd ther it is folks!!! The slippery slope of ""democratic socialism"" leading into the depths of communism“BE AFRAID - the rich people might lose their homes and businesses!!”\s\sGood.

The reasons on why they don't go to the doctor are varied but mostly they feel okay so why go.  \sAnd some people are just so over the top on having to pay taxes.  I guess they think that all the amenities that we take advantage of will just take care of themselves magically you know like roads bridges food safety water treatment forest fires.........The problem is it’s horribly mismanaged. We’ve repeated seen how corrupt government spending is. It’s tremendously wasteful. Without reform people will always be against more taxes if they even have a basic understanding of money. Plus just because I have my taxes raised does that mean I’ll get better care? Or will this money be funneled into stock market share prices that our generous government officials loaded up on ahead of time. \s\sI’d like a simplified universal healthcare style setup if it meant better care and efficient spending of my money. But life is already hard enough where $1000 a year could add even more pressure to the inability to buy a house car or other necessities. \s\sNot against the idea of M4A but I am against the assholes in charge of it.not to mention that if its coming out in your taxes then you're not having to use taxed money to pay for your medical bills! I started a flexible spending account last year and feel dumb for never having opened one before. I know that I'll probably spend $500 a year on co-pays glasses dental etc so why not use non-taxed money to pay for it!But if you don’t use all of that money from FSA you lose it so you have to guess your limit carefully.[deleted]Plus you can ask for a raise sense the medical is not covered (and not a cost) by employers.Shoot I already pay around $60 a month for medicare that I can't even use. Might as well up it $23 so that I can use it and not have to pay EXTRA for insurance that will probably deny whatever coverage I need anyways.Another often overlooked benefit of single payer healthcare is that it separates employment from healthcare. No longer will you be tied to a job you hate because you'd lose your insurance if you changed jobs. It removes a major bargaining chip from employer's hands and gives it back to the workers.The people support medicare for all. They don't need anymore convincing.No they don't.The current system's failure isn't just because of the greed of Healthcare and Insurance industries. There is also a risk equation that they must balance. There is a ton of ""dine and dash"" with the healthcare industry. People who abscond after a big medical bill and never pay it etc. Healthcare and insurance companies have to price in the risk of these dine and dashers into their product and that's why it's more expensive. \s\sThis problem will also be eliminated from the system and good customers wouldn't have to pay for bad customers in a Medicare for All system because there wouldn't be any bad (i.e. nonpaying) customers.\s\sAnother costly risk factor is malpractice insurance but Medicare for All isn't going to do anything about that.The ""how do we pay for it"" talking point really means ""how do we (pharma insurance hospitals) keep making money hand over fist?\s\sIt will save every American money period. Also having a single payer prevents companies from price gouging. The US isn't going to take one thousand of your tax dollars to purchase a single EpiPen. \s\sThe ""how do we pay for it"" is just a healthcare racket narrative that's promoted solely because they don't want to lose their golden goose.Well to be factual the insurance companies don’t pay the high prices it’s just a sticker price. \s\sThe high cost of healthcare in the US comes from us arguably over testing for more than we need to. In single payer systems it’s often one test at a time where in the US theyll do lots of tests at once to find what’s wrong faster (for better or for worse)\s\sEdit: this also finds things that may not need to be treated but inevitably lead to more tests and visits.But but will M4All pay for my Ivermectin /sOf course it would people still travel to countries where parasites are common.  There's also still a (small) chance to get parasites in the USA.  People with Rosacea also can have it prescribed since it helps with that.  There's also off-label uses but that varies from doctor to doctor.  Which is true for all medications. For example there's a pregnancy/fertility drug for women that has an off label use to restore testosterone levels in men.  Viagra's boner purpose was off label until it became the reason it was mostly prescribed (it was originally for low blood pressure IIRC). \s\sYes I'm trying to dodge the topical issue here... lolYesI recently had to explain this to a relative…..older….avid Fox News watcher.   She didn’t believe me that yes taxes will go up.   I literally was down to using small number math as as example.  I reached a point that I had to walk away.   \sI really believe that in years to come they are going to find a neuro chemical or gene mutation that effected all of these people.  I hope that’s the case.  I don’t want to believe there are this many completely blind and ignorant humans among us.While your math may be solid your understanding of value may be lacking. More money doesn’t mean better quality and no waste.Citizens United has not helped with getting M4A passed due to intense lobbying (bribing) of congress to not pass these types of laws.Nobody is forcing Democrats to take the bribes.  They could reject the bribes at any time.  Why aren't they rejecting the bribes?I've got an idea. Let's start a website or new Subreddit. We'll call it: \s\s""HEY SHOW YOUR COVID MEDICAL BILLS!""  Surely the antivaxxers anti-maskers and the like will be getting the bills and will get a chance to see for themselves that Medicare4All is a good idea.\s\s Eh wishful thinking. I'm sure there will be some circular logic that will come into play.BuT I dOn't waNt thE iMmigRaNts to bE aBle to gO gEt trEatEd toO.\s\sThere are so many people who would gladly accept a worse outcome for themselves as long as others have to suffer more.Bold of you to assume I could afford or even bothered to pay any of that. My broke ass doesn’t get medical treatment 🤣If you make under $34k/yr your taxes don't go upMath is hard....These numbers sound a bit low. Try $9000 total premium per year $8000 deductible plus co-pays and co-insurance. This was what I was paying through the state exchange the last year I bought my insurance under AMA.It's because people who have employer-sponsored healthcare pay much less:  according to one study [in 2019 the average amount covered employees contributed was $1242 for single coverage and $6015 for family coverage](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/average-cost-of-employer-sponsored-health-insurance).  And most people get insurance through their employer.The $1000 tax increase sounds pretty low.  84 bucks a month or thereabouts. Is that supposed to cover the cost of treatment for every person in the US at the same quality and availability?They aren't conservatives because they can do math.How did you arrive at the $1000 tax increase?Really if you look at Medicare for all it's a $34k/yr income minimum so it would be about $1300/yr but that's still cheaper an any private health insurer.[deleted]1000$ a year?  Lmao yall just keep wanting to give and give and give to the government.  \s\sHow bout we re-appropropriate shit like FOREIGN AID and forever retirements and benefits for 2 years of ""work"".  Why don't we start trimming the fat.  \sBecause 1000k a year from everyone is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  I would assume it was a year because there's more than 65-70% of the US population that not in their wildest dreams could they afford 1k a month for SOMEONE ELSES SHIT.No lol universal healthcare is cheaper and more efficient for everyone so if you want to trim fat you should support Medicare for All.If you think Foreign Aid is a meaningful part of our budget then you have been fucking brainwashed by right-wing propaganda (no seriously; the ""foreign aid is a huge part of our budget"" thing is a myth intentionally started by Republicans decades ago).\s\sSo either you're repeating their propaganda unaware it's lies or you are yourself lying.\s\sIf the former please educate yourself before you spread more misinformation.\s\sIf the latter fuck yourself with a rake.Based. I agree. Let's stop spending our money on stupid crap too.\s\sLet's not forget the government is inefficient at anything it does and bureaucrats should not have a say in people's medical decisions that's between them and their doctors.\s\sIt would also open the door for yet more government corruption because god knows our country needs more of that....What turns me off is having our useless government in full control of our health.What turns me off is for-profit ~~anything~~ ""healthcare"" and for-profit ""education"". Having to pay to fucking exist and it's too expensive to grind for diplomas^(1) in order to pay to fucking exist.\s\sdiplomas^(1): Which are given out by for-profit businesses who couldn't care less who actually deserves to have what's seen as a success in higher education and ""intelligence"". Nobody gives a fucking shit if someone's intelligent because if some greedy ass business says you aren't than you can't be.Instead it's a for profit group whose goal has nothng to do with your health.You are both not wrong and wrong here.  Our government is currently corrupt and doing Everything they can to stop single payer.  They WILL try to defund it and bribe corporate news to say how terrible it is.  Want an example of this?  Look at the tories going after the NHS in the UK.\s\sThe issue is the alternative is a private corporation owning it and then you just have what we have now which isn't workable for the vast majority of the population.\s\sIf we were to replace our corruption in Our government with regular working class people it wouldn't feel so bad.Damn don't like governments controlling your body?Uh Medicare has premiums and deductibles.\s\shttps://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/medicare-costs-at-a-glanceThis is why I prefer to call it ""Improved Medicare for All"". The purpose isn't just to move everyone onto medicare but to fix the flaws inherent in the Medicare program (such as the 80/20 split goes away).> Uh Medicare has premiums and deductibles.\s\sIt was an eye opener for me a couple years ago when an elderly couple from Washington State killed themselves because they could not afford the medical costs...and they were on medicare.Medicare for all is not the solution. But I’d take it over the bullshit we have now.taxes would go up more than 1k by a lot and people like me who only go to the docs like 2 or 3 times at most a year only pay like maybe $600 at most too.If you would research how much a single payer system would be (it would be cheaper as payment is more guaranteed so a deal can be worked out)\sYou wouldn't have that opinion. You can't really plan on having a emergency be it a heart attack etc so saying you only go 2 or 3 times a year is also stupid. \s\sAnd before you say ""people are literally dying on wait lists in canada"" that's just not true nobody who is in critical condition has to wait if you go to the er with a broken arm though you may have to wait longer than usual because chances are someone is actually in danger of dying if they aren't treated whereas you're just uncomfortably waitingLike the other person said where M4A really shines is unexpected emergencies. You shouldn't be forced into bankruptcy because you have an accident and end up in the hospital for a week. Unless you've got a really nice job with some killer insurance you're probably going to end up with a huge bill even after insurance.With single payer drugs can't be price gouged. The idea isn't that pharmaceutical companies can still charge hundreds of dollars for a 30 day supply of medication and the US just goes and pays them whatever they ask for. As the single payer they get to negotiate drug and treatment costs and they're dramatically reduced. \s\sIf you're uninsured that's fine. But you really can't just expect to never have a medical emergency. Back when I was younger and relatively healthy I wasn't too worried about getting sick...then I get into a car accident and suddenly have tens of thousands of dollars in bills.Why’d you completely steal the top post of the month lmao https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/p8abeq/not_too_hard_to_understand/Um.

But yes they should also be included in m4a because the costs of them would also go down and there'd be a lot less rural folks with missing teeth and half blind from blurry vision.The problem is when your taxes go up and then you also can't get those benefits either due to what income level you are considered  but yet still can't afford it and now your taxes are higher so you can't afford even more now.That's not how Medicare works. There aren't any income qualification levels with Medicare.  It's simply age determined and nothing else afaik.See that's why its called Medicare \_for all\_. Doesn't matter if you're living in a cabin in the woods completely disconnected from society or a fucking billionaire or anywhere in between. You deserve basic healthcare at no cost to you.The question will be how do we fund the hundreds of thousands of people who work for the predatory healthcare industry who will lose their jobs due to Medicare for All.We are already funding them now...Money to kill good.\s\sMoney to live bad.That’s what they charge the military so it actually costs around $890.

That is bullshit. Exxon can pay for its own protection.\s\sSecondly taxpayers are paying the billionaire class that causes climate change to continue causing climate change. Taxpayers have also been indirectly funding the anti-climate action campaign of Big Oil.\s\sPeople need to demand an end to this insanity.Right now they're thinking... looks like we just found one more problem that another $80000 could solve. ;-)The top 1% of our earners pay over 40% of federal taxes. So how are taxpayers paying the billionaire class? The general population pay less than 30% of all federal taxes.The Javelin brought to you by Raytheon.I might be wrong but wasn’t it developed under Texas Instruments? My grandpa was one of the engineers behind javelin and that’s who he worked for. I was always confused why the people who made my calculator was also making missiles.Something something we have to em over there so we dont have to fight em over here.All I said was defend foreign interference.\s\sNow I'm an antisemite because I don't want to fund isreal's iron dome.\s\sA weapon of war is a weapon of war.If visa is not issued to them they won't be able to come. 9/11 guys were in USA officially learned how to fly officially and both CIA and FBI failed to stop them. But why? You know why.American capitalism isn't about making sense. It's about permanently defending and expanding profits and power at the expense of logic humanity and our collective futures.

The issue here is one of how we do the business of war moreso than the fact that we own the kit if we didn't have cost + contracts we'd be much better off we wouldn't get scalped on equipment essential for national solvency.I feel like this comparison leaves out a few important people.  1 $80000 Javelin round is:\s\s* Designed by a guy that makes 2x the cost\s* Built by a guy that makes 0.5x the cost\s* sold by a guy that makes 10x the cost\s* purchased by a guy who makes 5x the cost\s* fired by a guy who makes 0.5x the cost\s* fired at a guy who makes .007x the cost\s\sI just pulled all of those number out of thin air but I suspect they aren't that far off.\s\sEdit: changed built to designed and added more accurate estimate of build labor costs...Eh I'm pretty sure they're built by a guy that makes .5x the cost like the guy firing it. I think you're thinking about the engineers that designed it.First I make one component of that system and I make 1x the cost......\s\sSecondly they would not use a javelin on 1 individual. It's an anti vehicle weapon mostly tanks.ObligatoryMeetTheHeavyJoke.pngAmerica!!

I get that it’s a BHA but it’s still not exactly the same as income even if room and board is an unavoidable expense.Just saying they do probably make that in a year. Most of the military gets free room and board in very expensive areas of the country/world… accounting for that a lot of these guys actually make more than 80k a year.

We don’t pay attention to things like real world facts here we just hate the military ;)intelligence is not completely lostDo socialist countries have armies? If so what is the ratio between what they pay for missiles and pay their soldiers?This post is more lamenting the fact that the missile is fired in the first place. It doesn't matter how much a missile costs if they're rarely used. However that's not the case. Everything about the military industrial complex encourages conflict whereas the opposite should be true under a logical system.TBF I'm pretty sure he'd rather have superior weapons that keep him alive than get paid more before his inferior weapons get him killed.Almost like if we weren't putting his life in danger in the first place we wouldn't have to pay for it\s\sFunny that!I don't even wanna know how much that camera must've cost!

Not to mention will eradicate unemployment.You forgot the /s[deleted]If you seriously think this post is just people complaining about the fact that they don't make the kind of money it requires to fire one javelin missile you have a seriously flawed and myopic worldview[You know you shouldn't do that in this sub](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-wrong-twice-claim-about-defense-bud/)If only 7 billion people would realize only 2300 people are holding the entire globe hostage.Instead powerful people are reimagining how to fuck us over some more with ""Build Back Better""/""The Great Reset""Does anyone wonder why the world worships paper? Money has no inherent value in this world. It only has the power that the people who believe in it give it. Money is the illusion of power. An illusion that 99% of the world believes is real. The accumulation of wealth has never been about the money (You can live a very comfortable life with very little money). It’s all about having power over others. A very ego driven lust for power. If 70% of the world woke up tomorrow and decided that money means nothing to them the world economies would collapse all power would cease to exist and the world would be a very different place. A place where mass groups of people don’t have to suffer at the hands of a few greedy people. Yes we would very much lose much of the luxuries and comfortability we have in this modern world but it would very much work itself out in time and we’d all be freer and happier than we are now in this prison of a system designed to benefit a slim few’s ridiculous and narcissistic views of what a good life is. Those are ideas that will get you assassinated if you try and bring them to the public’s attention. This is very much the matrix and the reason  why Economic equality will never exist within the system. It’s the first step in ripping down the entire systemI don't think it's too late to organize for those changes.

Hearst was a well-known US newspaper proprietor known as the ‘father’ of the so-called ‘yellow press’ i.e. the sensationalist press.  William Hearst began his career as a newspaper editor in 1885 when his father George Hearst a millionaire mining industrialist Senator and newspaper proprietor himself put him in charge of the San Francisco Daily Examiner.\s\sThis was also the start of the Hearst newspaper empire an empire which strongly influenced the lives and thinking of North Americans.  After his father died William Hearst sold all the mining industry shares he inherited and began to invest capital in the world of journalism.  His first purchase was the New York Morning Journal a traditional newspaper which Hearst completely transformed into a sensationalist rag.  He bought his stories at any price and when there were no atrocities or crimes to report it behoved his journalists and photographers to ‘arrange’ matters.  It is this which in fact characterises the ‘yellow press’: lies and ‘arranged’ atrocities served up as truth.\s\sThese lies of Hearst’s made him a millionaire and a very important personage in the newspaper world.  In 1935 he was one of the richest men in the world with a fortune estimated at $200 million.  After his purchase of the Morning Journal Hearst went on to buy and establish daily and weekly newspapers throughout the US.  In the 1940s William Hearst owned 25 daily newspapers 24 weekly newspapers 12 radio stations 2 world news services one business providing news items for films the Cosmopolitan film company and a lot of others.  In 1948 he bought one of the US’s first TV stations BWAL – TV in Baltimore.  Hearst’s newspapers sold 13 million copies a day and had close to 40 million readers.  Almost a third of the adult population of the US were reading Hearst newspapers every day.  Furthermore many millions of people throughout the world received information from the Hearst press via his news services films and a series of newspapers that were translated and published in large quantities all over the world.  The figures quoted above demonstrate how the Hearst empire was able to influence American politics and indeed world politics over very many years – on issues which included opposition to the US entering the Second World War on the side of the Soviet Union and support for the McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts of the 1950s.\s\s William Hearst’s outlook was ultra-conservative nationalist and anti-communist.  His politics were the politics of the extreme right.  In 1934 he travelled to Germany where he was received by Hitler as a guest and friend.  After this trip Hearst’s newspapers became even more reactionary always carrying articles against socialism against the Soviet Union and especially against Stalin.  Hearst also tried to use his newspapers for overt Nazi propaganda purposes publishing a series of articles by Goering Hitler’s right-hand man.  The protests of many readers however forced him to stop publishing such items and to withdraw them from circulation.\s\s After his visit to Hitler Hearst’s sensationalist newspapers were filled with ‘revelations’ about the terrible happenings in the Soviet Union – murders genocide slavery luxury for the rulers and starvation for the people all these were the big news items almost every day.  The material was provided to Hearst by the Gestapo Nazi Germany’s political police.  On the front pages of the newspapers there often appeared caricatures and falsified pictures of the Soviet Union with Stalin portrayed as a murderer holding a dagger in his hand.  We should not forget that these articles were read each day by 40 million people in the US and millions of others worldwide!\s\s---\s\sfrom [Lies concerning the history of the Soviet Union: From Hitler to Hearst from Conquest to Solzhenitsyn](http://www.mariosousa.se/LiesconcerningthehistoryoftheSovietUnion.html)Such as?We call them ""Socialist by name only"" people.That problem is inherent in the nature of communist revolution itself. The material conditions that are necessary to bring about the revolution also preclude the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.Confirmed serial rapist Joe Biden is scared of socialism.

Them nasty commies after centuries of Tsar barbarities awoke to devastation and America attacking it.\s\sGO FIGGER...Y’know you can agree with their civil rights ideas while disagreeing with the communist part right?Ya know it seems wildly suspicious when the school system leaves out a very specific and important detail to the story of civil rightsWhen literally every single civil rights activist is involved in socialist organising I'm pretty sure you're at the point where they're intrinsically linked.noNòn[deleted]No they're saying that every civil rights activist was ALSO a socialist.During the Cold War supporters of the Soviet Union offered support or targeted disenfranchised groups in the US to increase domestic social unrest.   Soviet propagandist and ideologues often saw African Americans as natural allies against the West.  So its not surprising that many activists from the Cold War era would have some linkage or affiliation with Communist or Socialist movements.  Very similar to the way the Chinese Communist Party targets disenfranchised or marginalized groups in the US today.love this fucking framing as though it were the soviet union's fault for bringing attention to the lynching of black people not their atrocious treatment by the USA. get out of here with this anticommunist garbage.These are two interesting thoughts to juggle.\s\s(1) we should help those less fortunate\s(2) countries can do this to sow discord as an ulterior motiveHmm maybe they were the good guys[Maybe if they weren't systematically marginalized and abused....](https://youtu.be/wZqR2KEd_hk)Yeah fuck those commies for “targeting” black people to help them organize and demand rightsThis sounds awfully similar to a fascist conspiracy theory.black people don’t have the mental fortitude to organize and support their communities so it must have been those damn communists who won over their minds /s\s\soh snap I realized as I wrote that sarcastic comment that it kind of describes trump supporters and their representatives.Could it be that the school system doesn't want to demonize civil rights figures? Communism is a pretty shit thing to believe in these days imo\s\sEdit: If the communists are down voting you you're doing something right lolWait until you learn about capitalism you are going to be shocked!Why is it a shitty thing to believe in?Eh it's no worse on paper than any other system. \s\sThe problem that every system has is when people gain and retain power over others.That is 100% face palming bologna.how? why?[removed]Lmao people will know MLK Jr.’s name for hundreds of years. You’ll be forgotten within a generationplease jump into the path of a trainIf activist preached capitalism and the idea you get what you work for the sheep would never follow them. The idea of taking from those that were intelligent enough to succeed and willing to work for wealth sounds much better to those that have never figured out how to succeed and gain wealth.> you get what you work for\s\sSo you understand when we say Workers should recieve more of the capital produced by their labor.Scrolling through your comments history... you must really think you’re out here doing God’s work...You do not under capitalism by any stretch of he imagination ""get what you work for"" you absolute joke.You people will always praise and support the boot that tramples on your face and others because you hope one day you will own the boot.The khmer rouge are the only real socialists.Why do you say that young man (I'm guessing) what about Khmer Rouge makes them the only real socialists?Because I believe no one is wanting to kill for it we saw the overall deal with that a lot of people do not like to be violent they are pacifists killing isn't something they want to do and nobody wants to die by losing their only lifeline of making money to survive. \s\sSomething has to give.

I'm not just talking about the ""1%""... But also the top 10-20%... Liberal and conservative elites who just sit at home and click to make an Amazon worker run around like a mouse in a maze in some sick excitement... to send them some frivolous non essential products.I disagree  the top 10% of the people make $100000 or more  if you see it statistically they are still employees or small businessmen  not super rich people.\s\sAnd as someone who is in the top 2% and makes $380000 a year ( this varies per year  not fixed )  I can tell you that I have no power over system and I get fucked by billionaires and $100-millionaires every day. The system favours the top 4% ( statistically ) and yes they have gotten a lot more richer ( like me ).\s\sBut the ones who have significant power over the country are only the 0.1%What are you doing about it besides complaining online? You can keep saying what's wrong and how bad it is but if you're just going to sit there and do nothing about it then you're just a hypocrite.\s\sI'm saying that with the best intentions. People need to stop acting like they're spectators. Live by your ethics organize build and strategize. The People's Party is a good initiative but you need to look at a more concrete and personal level. You can't change a system if you can't even change yourself.>	What are you doing about it besides complaining online?\s\sThis sub does nothing but complain and when I’ve pointed it out in the past I’ve been told “this place isn’t for activism.” WOTB exists for one purpose only — to leave you feeling dejected hopeless and depressed enough to stop voting.\s\s Several months ago one of the mods admitted to suffering from depression; I was canceled by WOTB because I pressured the community to DO SOMETHING about the problem. They kept saying “we can’t afford health insurance” but I was providing them links to FREE TALK THERAPY and offering to go with the mods who suffer from this. No one was interested. \s\sI’ve reached out to some here complaining about their low wage job that I would be willing to help them jumpstart a career in sustainable construction. I have risen from an untrained draftsman to an architect over the last 8 years and would be happy to point anyone to the right resources. None are interested. It goes back to the toxic culture on this subreddit that celebrates not taking care of oneself. \s\sAfter 5 years of this I know it will never change here because progressing is difficult especially in the area of mental health. At a certain point the best thing you can do is try to warn others. Sometimes the truth hurts.\s\sI like turtles.Fuck Manning! That little shit is a goddamned traitor and a fraud. Several of my family members got their identity’s stolen because of this bitch. Use literally anyone else but Manning.""Exposing war crimes is treason! Our boys were just doing their job by blowing up that ambulance!""Well no one wants to get shot. Or Manninged. That’s why.Perhaps we're looking at this the wrong way.  Maybe the system was never designed to support people during period of crisis -- we were just lied to and told that it was.\s\sIf the system hasn't changed in 200+ years maybe it's not broken -- maybe we're just not looking at it the way it was meant to be.\s\sDon't forget Social Services that we are grateful for like Food Stamps/SNAP Social Security & Medicare aren't even 100 years old.  (Social Security wasn't enacted until 1935 Food Stamps weren't enacted until 1939 and Medicare wasn't a thing until 1965.)I think you're right the system was never meant to help us or be for us in any way.  As Chomsky said: the primary role of government is to protect property from the majority.\s\sOf course he still said ""vote Biden"" because the orange boot is scarier.The System was designed for a benefit of a relatively small group of white property owners. It is people pushing back against this system that has made it better over time. We have backslid in a lot of ways over the past 40 years. If enough people can be engaged positive changes can be made once again.Thats exactly her point. We pay trillions into a system and we were lied to that it was a system for the people when its not.\s\sIts a system of siphoning assets to banks and military manufacturers in blowing up foreign lands.Dual power time?No matter how fucked up the system is\s\s\sPeople only get angry enough and dedicated enough to change it when they their bellies are empty.\s\sRussian Revolution\sFrench Revolution\sSee any revolution when the system was changed.\s\sAnd in our system only 12% of the people are food insecure ( not malnourished ). So no one wants to overthrow the government and change the whole system or at least they don't feel the extreme urgency to do so. That's why we have a lot less revolutions in this century than other centuriesAnd due to a lack of suitable/expanded social safety net and a myriad of other things enabling  Americans to be struggling one paycheck to another they are hardly in the position to strike or riot as the French. And even if they did I bet you MSM would label them as violent if they even covered it and or the FBI and law enforcement would work to crush the movement just as they did with Occupy (and even BLM) under Obama.""Have you seen the other guy? - Vote Kudos!""To make money for the richest at the topI wish people would specify when they talk about ""the system"".\sIt's about as vague as complaining about ""the man"".\sI'm left to guess what ""system"" is being referred to.\s\sIf I had to guess it sounds like it's the economic system specifically that has failed us.\sThat's the system that manages the production and distribution of goods and services to the people that need them.\sAnd that economic system that has failed us has a name.\s\sIt's called ""capitalism"".Also what’s meant by we.  That’s a big one that does a lot of work for a lot of people.\s\sAt his best Chomsky once said people mistake end goals for a plan to get there.  You ask them how to deal with wealth inequality and they say “general strike”.  \s\sThere isn’t a ‘we’ yet at least not in any actionable sense.  Posting and reading relatable posts gives the impression there is but there isn’t.It exists to rule disguised as a choice like a casino. Yes there are a few winners to keep the lie going but it’s the house that owns everyone who comes through the door. The masters don’t want to be bowed down to. Force begets uprising. Through the invention of money and the manipulations of it one can own you through deception instead of the whip. This is neofeudalism.Because it still functions enough to be able to kill a whole goddamn lot of us if we were to do shit about it.Probably the single most undeniably heroic daring courageous and principled member of the trans community alive today yet that community (as a whole) does not even know who Chelsea Manning is. \s\s.\s\sWeird isn’t it?No they know rupaul or other trans celeb.

I'm the weekly free drop.capitalism isnt supposed to take care of the poor etc. it is designed to benefit the bourgeoisie and thats exactly what it's doing. the only reason the welfare state exists is to pacify the masses enough to hold back desire for a change (socialism).Because revolution is very difficult and uncomfortable and reform makes some problems better but others worse.Yep.\sBut poverty misery and economic injustice is also very difficult and uncomfortable.\sWhen material conditions get uncomfortable enough revolutions (or at least attempts at revolutions) can happen.Americans aren't looking for a Revolution. -Joe Biden\s\sAs out of touch as Hillary and Pelosi are.

For years I've listened and read an awful lot but have yet to see proposals that have even a glimmer of a chance of producing positive results.  \s\sFor now I'll be supporting the People's Party.

You might also consider joining their [Socialist Equality Party](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/pages/sep/us/home.html) which is part of an international network of parties working to independently organize and mobilize the working class against the bourgeoisie.America is probably the most soma drugged society which explains the lethargy. But it only takes about 20% to create critical mass which then creates an avalanche and if you get lucky like the Russians did you topple the Romanovs (read DemRep oligarch duopolist dictatorship). When the avalanche begins direction not force will be the problem.\s\sIf however on the other hand there is a burgeoning America to attack America even whilst the revolution like America did Russia it will probably fail. And regardless of how well you pick up the pieces like the Bolsheviks did a greed that is halfway to fruition and was your former ally might spend the equivalent of eight trillion that U$ et al spent. I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that a racist at its core like America ""built on"" faux religiosity and genuine genocide will lead that charge.\s\sLook at Netanyahu and tell me that slab of rancid pork doesn't want to control and torture humanity. At its core zionazi is as evil as the original nazi.It takes much less than 20%. \s\sSignificantly less. \s\s3.5% of the population is all that's needed to enact revolutionary change.\s\sGive this a listen. https://youtu.be/YJSehRlU34wThe tweet makes no sense.  If you think there are other countries that you'd rather live in you can move to your preferred country.There isn't another livable planet. If we want a **good** one we have to make it so ourselves.Moving costs money and the process of leaving is made as difficult as humanly possible by bureaucrats who understand that America needs a passive population of wage slaves. Will you be contributing to GoFundMes to help people leave this shithole country?Oh yeah.  Up and relocating to another country is easy as pie.  Nevermind the fact that other countries also have their own rules regarding immigration and work 🙄Or we could protest and agitate for political change *here*Human complacency and the need to have power over others.\s\sMost of us are complacent. Those that aren’t are either power hungry or too few to enact real change for the better. \s\sWe just need people to not be complacent because the majority of us would not be driven to have power over other people.Apathy and tragedy of the commons. People are distracted and brainwashed into embracing tribalism and shunning those who reach out for class solidarity. They are also not liable to protest (or form a union even) as they are afraid of losing their job/what little they *do* have.Well duh. We have to support Raytheon in building bombs and planes to kill brown children 4000 miles away. If we have money left over than it will go to banks or pharma companies for any losses then we can consider helping the people that paid into that pot. consider.>Why do we allow this system to continue to exist?\s\sBecause the overwhelming majority of us are to chickenshit to sacrifice everything for what we believe in.  We want our comfort and conveniences and stable lives.  Power is taken not asked for but obtaining real power takes real risk.  I might be projecting but it seems the overwhelming majority of us are content to be cowards.It's time to break down this useless system and create a New one from scratch.Hurry up and ""invade"" the capitol already.\s\s/sI think folks are pussyfooting around an ugly realization but violence and the the threat of violence locks this current system in. America has made greed money and violence its true religion. At a grassroots level politicians use the threat of hyper-violent police to create compliance. So what happens when the people no longer are affected or give a damn about the threat of police? This is why there is no police reform and why they come down hard on the populace and especially the disenfranchised African Americans. Because the African American first and foremost has proven himself to 1. create movements (a ""Black messiah"") that challenge that status quo and 2. no one (apart from indigenous americans) has more reason to see the status quo change.   \s\s\sI dunno if its too late...  society is like the alcoholic who can't go cold turkey or he will die. We are sick and the sickness is sanctioned by the state the madness is as much a part of the american ideology as the time tested cliches of love. It is what America does... the greed the violence the hypocrisy. We tell ourselves there are only a few bad apples amongst cops but then you realize the entire concept of policing (as it exists) is bad and the good cops are the few.   \s\s\sI'd like to see things change in my litetime but I'm not holding my breath.Loses some cred because of his stupid faux progressive bootlicker hat.Ad hominem fallacy. Stupid people can and do occasionally make good points.Yes that is the sentiment beaten into us from a young age by a paid-off propagandized media and school system (*you don't want to grow up to be a trash man do you?*).\s\sTurns out trash men have it pretty good and regardless deserves the same treatment and respect as any 'educated' profession.Mostly it's actually anti government sentiment that power corrupts absolutely. That things like UBI enslave people and make them rely on a government who essentially wants to enslave them. It's a compelling theory tbh. Also there's the anti communist propaganda which is stupid in my opinion.Who cares if most people are more or less unspectacular normies without remarkable aspirations or talents? What does it matter? We shouldn't rank people's access to a good quality of life based on their potential to be a savant or whatever.The Democratic Party is now the party of Meritocracy you are either rich highly educated or have an extraordinary talent or expertise in order to have value. Or you can be a token working class minority who is used to virtue signal an elite's wokeness. But as soon as they are done with you then you're sent back to the meat grinder (our predatory economy).Here's the tweet in case anyone wanted to retweet:\s\s[https://twitter.com/IsicaLynn/status/1328087512133238786](https://twitter.com/IsicaLynn/status/1328087512133238786)Honestly I don’t ever know what people mean when they say socialist. Some people are talking about European style capitalism or the Nordic system other people are full blown tankies. Nobody also ever seems to bother differentiating between socialism and communism regardless of whether they’re a hardcore libertarian or a Stalinist. \s\sI don’t like the socialist label because it’s too loaded with negative connotations. I would like a form of capitalism that that puts heavy restraints and regulations on larger businesses to prevent them from abusing people. Our current system is cancer. \s\sI guess I consider myself a populist or an FDR style Democrat.FDR style Democrat is known as social democrat. But here's the thing: the New Deal was FDR's bid as he put it to ""save capitalism."" \s\sSprinkling crumbs on the peasants isn't enough. Socialism means collective democratic ownership of production.People are lazy. They are lazy at forming their own opinions. Americans in general are in the dumb side of things ready to give their individual minds over to someone who presumably agrees with their short sighted beliefs and who they learn to trust to think for them.I always try and remind people who say the first part that that's their perspective of humans *coming from* a capitalist society. They're like that because of the world we live in. Humans aren't naturally lazy or miserable or dumb or whatever if you see them as that think about what kind of society those humans live in and compare them to humans who lived peacefully and sustainably in indigenous tribes. Were they selfish and lazy?Absolutely. Otherwise why would we have had to SpReAd DeMoCrAcY?It’s both there are lazy people and there are people that would do great things without being in dire straits.  Neither beliefs are wrong. I think that what everyone can agree on is that bad luck seems to fall on people in the lower class exponentially and we would like to create a system where the bad luck is more evenly dispersed not all pilling up on one group. \s\sThe general concept people who are anti socialist have about it is that it’s a system that wants to tear down the top and target people who have been successful. I doubt that most anti socialist people would be opposed to a system that works to create more successful people on every level. Perspective and language plays a big role in the persuasion.\s\sThe phrase eat the rich equates to many as being anti success. It’s hostile language that sounds like a system of pure revenge. And why would anyone want to support that?? If you want to gain allies in creating a better world you have to start with maturity and respect for other peoples perspectives and experience. Then discovering where you differ on a subject is half the battle won. Avoid blaming and emotional revenge talk to start. All people rich and poor have great value. Romanticism of either group leads to a failure of awareness of the other. You won’t build a better world by political violence or emotional revenge. Intelligence and creativity is how you build a better world.You chalk it up to “bad luck”.  Really? What’s next bad karma or Jesus didn’t want to joke a player up? Nah.  It’s by design.This is really well said. I'm a contrarian cunt by nature so when I went to a super left-leaning college I tried to find arguments to counter my friends' socialist beliefs. It took me arguing some of these points aloud for me to realize how idiotic the idea is that privation is somehow necessary for the economy to function. Even older conservative thinkers like Dostoyevsky revert to this point that ""man does not live by bread alone"" in order to argue against redistributing wealth. The argument basically boils down to: even when the poor do have those basic necessities like food and shelter they will still be unsatisfied/without purpose. This is such an irrelevant argument. The point of regulating wages/welfare is not to give the lower class a sense of purpose/satisfaction or somehow aid them with spiritual development it's to give them enough to stay alive.You don't have to go socialist--government and/or workers owning the means of production--  to ensure that a population is not perpetually in dire straits.  Scandinavian nations are capitalist but with more (and better) public programs than the US.[deleted]Work is also voluntary in the US.  No prison needed.Why would you choose to work in prison?Even if this was a real thing and not just some uncited claim on the internet I don't believe it's out of ""laziness"". Prison is mind-shatteringly boring. Literal staring at the same 4 walls for years. The only reason I can think of turning down optional work would be out of conscientious objection.Its interesting that people are trying to find rational reasons for what is essentially the result of [decades of propaganda](https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/fifties/essays/anti-communism-1950s) directed at the [American public](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/22/anti-communist-laws-california-trump-russia).We do not need your studies. We can see every day what people on welfare are like.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThere is several generations of urban poor that have virtually every expense covered from healthcare to rent. Zero real pressure to secure funds. For 10s of millions of mostly urban poor there has been UBI for decades.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sWhat have they done with it? Reached excellence? Hardly. It has destroyed their once proud culture and delivered them whole into the antagonistic hands of globalist warmongers.I agreeIf it was true that people need the threat of poverty to keep them working everyone with a million plus dollars would immediately retireSuccess is addictive. Being successful is itself an art. And people who are a little good at it tend to get better and better exponentially. The same goes the other way. If you have very little you can become very good at it. Psychologically speaking happiness isn’t exactly linked to wealth either. Which seems counterintuitive but nonetheless is still true.Exactly!None of the what's in the tweet are pro's or con's of socialism though.  The tweet is about welfare.I think it's less about suffering and more about motivation.  How do you propose we motivate people to succeed under socialism.People don't need to ""be motivated"". Humans are naturally driven to improve their lives the state of their community and to leave a legacy for future generations.\s\sWealth allows you to do that but only if you have a sufficiently large excess of wealth to invest in things beyond basic sustenance. And that's the rub: the average american lives paycheck to paycheck. They toil all day long to afford shelter food basic healthcare and little more.\s\sPeople today are honestly not that different from feudal serfs who farmed their land to put food on their table while all of the excess went to their lord. Where's the motivation in that? Why should anyone work harder than necessary if they receive no benfit from that extra work.\s\sIf you empower people with financial security they not only perform their work more efficiently (due to lower stress) but they will tend to use a greater portion of their free time investing in their work their family and their community.\s\sI know this from personal experience. For years I struggled to make ends meet. Lost my job at the beginning of the pandemic and landed a much better job six months later. I make about 50% more than I did pre-pandemic. I find myself using my spare income and time to finally repair all the broken shit in my home pay off debt invest in my art/several community projects and working overtime to deliver the best possible product. And I feel great doing all this. When I'm at my desk I'm concentrating on my work rather than stressing out about how I'm going to pay rent next month. I can buy a sandwich at the deli without having to try 3 credit cards before finding one that's not maxed out.A better life for everyone is pretty great motivationdo you think people inherently want to fail and starve in a ditch or something without some kind of external motivation?I disagree with the idea that payment is the only possible way to motivate people to work but you do realize that you can still have a work system based on paying people under socialism right?Simply the fact that people can work to benefit their community as opposed to lining pockets of their paymasters. It is how we prospered as a species from our tribal days onwards.Automation will create joblessness and poverty under capitalism.\s\sUnder socialism it will bless many people with a lot of free time.\s\sThat's the beauty of socialism you don't need to be motivated to succeed you can succeed by just not hurting others. I'm sure there's people that would love to do whatever tasks cannot be fully automated. If you search long enough you're going to find someone that's like ""Oh my god that's awesome I wanna do that!""\s\sAre there going to be people just not doing anything? Yes. But to that I say look at nature and see what animals do in their downtime. Nothing. Except for dolphins. Dolphins get high on puffer fish-poison and have sex for fun.Autonomy mastery purpose.

I think people would be surprised by how many politicians actually support some kind of socialism.Not really.  A lot of anti-socialist sentiment stems from the tremendous concentration of power necessary to achieve a truly socialist state that would be incompatible with liberal democracies.  Socialist ideals requires government officials to be dispassionate economic technocrats who don't react to the preferences of their constituent bases in managing the economy - that's never going happen.  All you'd get under Socialism is a long road toward increasing autocratic governance to control competing constituent groups.  \s\sCapitalist systems should have well-managed social welfare systems such as those that exist in the Nordic states.  But resorting to socialism would not remedy the challenges inherent in capitalism and would make many challenges worse..> from the tremendous concentration of power necessary to achieve a truly socialist state\s\sAnd who's arguing for that? People are arguing for policies and programs like M4A that benefit everyone instead of just the few and that gets dismissed as scary socialism.have you ever heard of a worker's council??I've definitely experienced this myself. When you're working 8+ hours per day there is little time or desire to do anything other than relax when you get home. \s\sWhen that time is freed up you can spend it on educating yourself and all sorts of creative and useful projects.Lazy is a medical diagnosis \s/sI would love to walk in nature for hours and deliberately collect garbage plant trees and help restore nature areas.

As of right now I can sort of try to do some of these things half assed or not at all because of time/money/resources.Ironically this how people lived before the Industrial Revolution. The business model of overproduction and overconsumption is killing us as people and killing the planet.Wow. Most of the people I know (and work with) do amazing things every day and work hard because it's a part of their DNA. They're not rich nor oppressed nor poor nor in dire straits.I literally don’t understand that. Do they think you will not get paid in socialism? Do workers not engineer and make everything in capitalism as well? What’s the problemIn socialism you are not rewarded for working harder or being smarter. You make what everyone else makes.Maybe they have never seen all the volunteers that keep things running smoothly.

If the people are happy healthy and strong the country would benefit in the long run.Read about Positive Psychology M. Seligman. Nothing to do with socialism everything to do with people being more creative and healthier and happier when they are not suffering. I mean this shit should be common sense by now c’mon.Why is the argument always one or the other capitalist or socialist as if a nation is only allowed to have one single system? \s\sI mean America already employs certain aspects of socialism in areas while also being labeled as an exclusively capitalist country but I figured most people were aware that we aren’t actually a purely capitalistic nation. \s\sWhenever I see debate about this topic it’s almost always an all or nothing argument from both sides which is never beneficial in any way and serves as a distraction from the actual issues. \s\sUnfortunately this basic ass two-sided construct is how most issues are discussed in America which is probably why so much shit is fucked up but for some reason I thought economic discussion could at least be a bit more in depth.I don't think it's that simple. This interpretation strike me as facile.\s\sThe deeper reason for conservatives distrusting socialism has little to do with a belief that people are fundamentally given to sloth and will do nothing if provided for. Though there might be a bit of that negative perception of human nature.\s\sthe primary reason they distrust socialism is that it is almost by definition centrally administered and it is that central government role that they have issues with. They'll tell you that any large federal program requires a large bureaucracy which they view as 'wasteful"" and ""inefficient' at best. Incompetent at worst.\s\sThey have a point if one looks at say Soviet Russia but the point disappears when one looks at Germany or Denmark which are Social democracies. Also France. The reason being is that those countries have fostered over decades and decades a tradition of civil servants who are educated dedicated well trained well paid and respected. There is status for the public servant in Europe - I have seen that in person.\s\sNow this isn't always true (there is Italy which is a basket case and the UK - another basket case of administration that's both inefficient and insufficiently responsive). \s\sStill even in the US there are well-managed programs one can point to. Specifically medicare Social Security and the Military. By contrast the MICs - private entities that they are are notoriously wasteful and inefficient - always coming in over budget and late. When I use this line of argument - pointing to the good federal centrally administered programs - and some of the bad - private large companies that are too hierarchical unfair and inefficient I usually score some points.\s\sUnfortunately the line about ""original sin of laziness' and their supposed belief in it won't fly too well and may get a serious push-back.\s\sOnly Twitterati see the need to resort to such shallow argumentation alas. Not easy to do deep observations in 100 or so characters.....It’s a shame answers like this will remain in the single-digit upvote doldrums.I’m not sure. Some policies actually reduce beaurocracy\s\sAn easy example is Medicare for all. Currently roughly 31% of costs in medicine are a result of administrative and beaurocratic fees. Countries which have centralized healthcare have far lessGermany and Denmark are two countries that were homogenous societies with well developed work ethic. Denmark restricted the influx of refugees and deported most that would not integrate into their society and labor market due to the burden on their welfare system. Germany is struggling because they freely allowed refugees and now are facing political and economic backlash. Assuming the US which already spends more on welfare and social programs then any other country could have even more generous social programs does not take into consideration the cost. Burdening the workers and producers with more taxes to give the non-producers better lives and give them even less incentive to become producers is probably not a great idea. Adding more government and bureaucracy to manage it only increases the cost. The policy of Opportunity Zones which gives people a chance to become producers and get off welfare seems to be a better idea. Incentives to keep fathers out of households should be reversed to encourage strong families which will aid in raising children that become producers and responsible member of society. \s\sSocial Security Medicare and the Military are very wasteful and only seem to be run efficiently because of the amount of money spent to manage them allows for the waste. If a private business operated in the same manner they would not survive.I'd just stop working it's not like if I had the means to live without constant stress I would save money up start a business and give back to the economy and its people...\s\sEdit: Guess the joke wasn't interpreted  so adding a /s to thisAnd there's where you're different from a lot of people. When friends who play the lottery talk about winning it's not big houses they want it's a fund to help people in greater financial straits than they are themselves. Some of the most generous people I've ever met were borderline poor themselves some of the least generous have been people who were financially comfortable. Some of the latter did give in other ways like volunteering their time to charitable organizations.this is just such a completely BS argument. not all rich people are hard working not all poor people are lazy. there is simply no correlation between wealth and .. hardworkingness.. I'm sure there's a better word for thatwork ethic or character maybeThat idea that hard work yields success has some merit. If you don’t prepare for winter you will freeze if you don’t hunt or grow food you will starve. But it isn’t isolated there are other markers for success attitude personality and intelligence are right up there too. The idea that nothing but hard work is how to be successful has more to do with Protestant philosophy. Very few people that are successful are successful through passion or luck. It does happen from time to time. But that idea is mostly bs. Passion and luck are not something you can count on. Systems work goals and passion are bullshit.Mark Knopfler disagrees.His solo stuff is good too so he did amazing things in and out of Dire Straits.IMO it's worse than that:  A good number of Americans are just mean.  For example studies have shown that it's less expensive to society to house people than to leave them homeless.  Not only do we prefer to pay more to keep them homeless but we won't even provide basic facilities like a coin-operated shower.>For example studies have shown that it's less expensive to society to house people than to leave them homeless.  \s\sAnd who benefits from this? Anyone that wants people desperate enough to accept shit wages. And so they have 0 problem with ""wasteful"" spending when its to keep the plebs in line.Homelessness is not solved by acting like a 5 year old and saying ""let's house/give houses to the homeless and then they won't be homeless anymore!"" That is how you fail to look at the issue behind homelessness and just exacerbate the system.\s\sThe majority of homeless people are that way due to mental issues. If you just house them they'll destroy the housing or let it fall into disrepair and neglect which people forget because they seem to think houses are magic and eternal without major upkeep.  I'm willing to concede its because our generations aren't  homeowners so we don't think of these things as readily but that doesn't  mean we should ignore it and then have a bunch of homeless people and destroyed property.\s\sMany homeless are on the streets by choice because their issues make them uncomfortable in available housing for the.homeless or they cannot.function in society and the homeless life is easier than the stress of society.\s\sIf you want to fix homelessness you first have to come up with a solution for the mentally ill then that would enable you to focus on the much easier issue of ""down on their luck"" homeless.\s\sI'm saying this as someone that has gone broke and homeless multiple times in life.shes wrong. shes giving the reactionaries too much credit. They have no idea what socialism is or why they hate it. if you ask them what socialism is they say whatever the prevailing narrative is at the time lately its Joe Biden back when the pandemic was going beginning it was China. The anti-socialists have no idea what it is or why they hate them they just need to take their rage out on somebody and that is a convenient enemy.Don't forget about VenezuelaWhy this is very true. I mean I’m from China so I feel like I understand the danger of communism. Most Americans actually have no idea what they should fear about communism or that most of the fear that they have is already happening in America but it’s just done by corporation.They also seem to love our police and military which are both socialist institutions. We don't have private corporations doing police work or forming a navy. \s\sIt's sort of like how a lot of Dems define Facists as anyone they disagree with politically. The right just defines socialists as anyone they disagree with lolI am the first kind of person and I'm sorry for ruining it everybody.Well you are wrong.I mean not everyone but I'm telling you if I don't have to do something to get something I will definitely not do it. I'm just lazy as fuck I honestly could (maybe also did) play videogames all day long every day which is why I have my doubts.Which does not mean that I think that capitalism doesn't sucks assYes this is exactly what I always hear from people skeptical of socialism. They always claim human nature is lazy and selfish.Those ppl are the lazy ones projecting their faults onto othersYeah they need to join a different bandI know I would.We seriously need to stop looking at the poor people when we talk about these issues. \s\sLook at the rich muthafuckers. YES their are some shitheads who don’t work and live off of their trust funds. But their are a bunch that go get educated and go do something they love to do. I’m willing to bet all these people who say that the poors won’t work are lazy pos’s themselves and it’s just projection. How many people have dreams that get shattered because of overwhelming adversity and the need to claw and scratch to survive. I’ve known tons of friends who let their dreams of being a photographer or pilot or many other numerous thing go because they couldn’t afford it. The only fucking thing that would happen if you gave everyone a liveable wage would be the VAST MAJORITY THRIVING going to school getting skills. You guys do realize that ALMOST EVERY SINGLE INVENTOR of the past 200 years had a WEALTHY PATRON SUPPORTING THEM. How many of you have dream jobs you would pursue if you had financial security. EXACTLY suck it haters.Capitalism is currently destroying my dream to one day not feel like pulling my insides out violently through my mouth because that sounds more pleasant than looking in the mirror because gender dysphoria is fun. I mean there's an easy fix. (not really quick but easy) but government says no.Why do you think the capitalists fight socialism so very very hard? Because once the cat's out of the bag the cat's out of the bag. Once people figure out how much better life is in a socialist democracy the capitalists are sunk. They HAVE to keep the blinders on the rest of us.There’s a much bigger incentive to work to have actual nice things than to just toil to surviveI've always worked primarily for my leisure time to be able to spend it somewhat comfortably doing a few of the things I enjoyed doing and without having to stress over how the bills will get paid.Talk about your classic straw man argument. Socialism has a world class history of producing maximal suffering so there is a hint of comedy here.   \s\s\sReduced to simple terms Socialism is based on theft on crime against the victim via overwhelming force by the state. It is criminal in the worst of ways. It leads to the ruling class being able to get away with murder and do anything they want.   \s\s\sThe rights of man are based upon NO ONE being able to harm the individual or for the state to commit crimes. Loathing of socialism is obviously the only logically moral stance one could take.First off a Market socialism would still promote hard work not laziness but it would benefit people directly for their hard work no longer would your work enrich someone else you'd be the one profiting from your effort.Yes not being debilitatingly depressed from capitalism does wonders...I was getting ready to leave the same comment!yascame here to just thatUnder Democrats....\s\sNever vote blue.Under both teams.don’t you see common folk? i’m a humble celebrity who hates the rich just like you! now if you’ll excuse me i’m going to go the party on one of Leonardo DiCaprio’s boatsThis. Actual socialism would in fact abolish the capitalist class.They think that somehow a de facto wealth cap (discouraging accumulation above a certain point) would stifle innovation. Why invent anything if you only make X billion dollars? They ignore that the ultra wealthy made comfortable livings off of initial ideas. The billions come in when you corner markets and stifle innovation to extract more money just to watch a ticker track upwards. We would not lose out on any innovation by preventing this last stage. Invent your cool thing make a few million then fuck off till you've another good idea. Even that is a compromise I'm barely comfortable with given that it's often (coughElonMuskcough) just a rich failson paying other people to invent shit for them.Exactly right. Billionaires have a suffocating stranglehold on the economy.In Sweden mask-wearing is **illegal**.\s\s[Sweden Bans Masks: ‘No Scientific Evidence’ They Prevent COVID](https://principia-scientific.com/sweden-bans-masks-no-scientific-evidence-they-prevent-covid/)\s\sSeems to be one of only a handful of countries left on the planet with a shred of scientific integrity.

Think about that. Our ""left"" wing party here is further right than the Tories or the Likud party. \s\sWe know what the solutions are. The democrats are just helping republicans block them. The system was designed to only take the opinions of the rich into consideration. They've bought ""both"" parties and literally own the media. Acknowledging this sucks but it's the cynical fucking reality.I am to the left of democrats but I am not aggressive. And actually I think that's the problem. Most liberals are not aggressive we want people to be kind to one another take care of each other and protect our civilization so all humans can have better lives. I think that's partially why democrats are soft and give in so much. Conservatives don't have these morals. They only care about their own kind and value aggression competition and violence. It's very hard to compete with them because they are ruthless and really do not care about hurting you. Sorry if this is a loose tangent from the post lol.\s\sI guess what I'm trying to say is that having a strong aggressive alliance to the left of democrats would force some of our efforts into policy. I've heard this suggestion before as it helped during Roosevelt's time having a strong coalition of unions. But it's difficult I think due to our passivity.\s\sThat's why Bernie is such a unicorn he's an aggressively good person.[David Graeber on liberals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9afwZON8dU)> Most liberals are not aggressive we want people to be kind to one another\s\sLiberals are ""woke"" pseudo-conservativesScratch a liberal (or their enabler) and a fascist bleeds.That's an extremely low empathy take.  \s\s""Only we are kind.""yep pretty much.Here's an idea America. Universal healthcare is not actually a leftist idea. It's just a common sense thing everyone sort of agrees with.We need to stop referring to things as leftist and rightist. Why not refer to things as human rightist and non-human rightist?\s\sEither you believe in taking care of everybody for the bigger picture or you don't. Quit beating around the bush with East West North South. There's no color for taking care of people. You either take care of humanity when it doesn't necessarily benefit you immediately or you only care when it's your turn.Universal healthcare is supported by the majority of centrists in America. The Reform Party for example America's leading centrist party wants to solve our healthcare crisis by putting these plans up for a national referendum vote. Our current politicians are the ones standing in the way of what America really wants. What we are doing today in America isn't working for too many people.Good Idea let's put this country that spends every spare cent murdering minorities overseas in charge of what kind of care they get here.

Americans aren't going to vote for weak shit that won't stand up and fight back.  I seem to remember Bernie repeatedly tanking his own campaign by calling Joe Biden his ""good friend"".  Bernie was so soft on Biden during the debates Bernie might as well have been Biden's weighted blanket.  When Biden was grossly and openly racist and Bernie said nothing that was a massive cuck move.  Everyone saw that Biden owned everyone in that room that he could rub his trump stink all over every candidate and nobody dare say anything about it.  That's power.\s\sBernie repeatedly embraced Russiagate which invalidated his entire presidential campaign as a co-conspirator in that baseless conspiracy theory which is exactly what the Democrats wanted him to do.  I seem to remember Bernie abandoning the campaign trail before Iowa and South Carolina to play silly government games that amounted to nothing.  This person clearly wasn't taking the campaign seriously.  We all saw it.  Taking a vacation from the presidential campaign is death delayed for a presidential campaign. AOC was played perfectly by ""master legislator"" Pelosi in that political coupe to align the Trump impeachment trial specifically to hurt Bernie in the critical moments of the primary campaign.\s\sBernie when faced with a clear conspiracy to wrap up the primary for man that didn't even know where he was at his South Carolina victory party repeatedly said nothing and slowly let it all slip away.  Bernie refused to go on the offensive at all during the entire campaign.  It was so pathetic it was shocking like they had a black mail video of Bernie committing a sex crime.  Bernie was practically giving every little shitlib that came by a slobbery knob job during that campaign. What we're we supposed to do?  Carry a dead man that too limp to even stay on his knees for the shitlib's knob job? \s\sWeekend at Bernies was supposed be a silly 80s movie about young men hauling a dead uncle named Bernie around a vacation destination.  Not a 2020 horror movie about an old man that took forty years of good will and spent it all in four months on sheep herding millions back to neoliberal's passive complacency.  Bernie's 2020 collapse was an unforgivable grotesque misuse power.  We threw him the crown and he kicked it into the mud and demand we lick it clean and put it on Biden's ""head"".  Bernie has lost all credibility.Don't shit on me. I believe the ideal Healthcare solution is a truly free market system. Shit on my idea but not my intention.

I completely disagree that innovation is a result of a profit-driven system precisely because the research that is being done and funded by public money will continue no matter what. Researchers barely see any profits to begin with and most of that money wastefully goes to middlemen and giant corporations that exist for no other reason than to extort the population.Your intention is irrelevant because your idea is so dogfuckingly stupid and has already been proven a failure so many times that you should not expect anyone to engage with your ideas.I think the problem is that healthcare should really NOT be profit driven in any way-shape-form.Yeah this kind of attitude is why Bernie has been the president since 2016!!

You either have a bank account anyway and pay fees for not maintaining the minimum balance or you don't have a bank account and pay fees to cash checks and for money orders.

Our system is so messed up that there is no one solution that would benefit everyone. For example I work for a small company and we are reimbursed for insurance premiums.

I can’t afford any of that premium  co pay medical costs to begin with. So I don’t. So now if you take away 1k. I’m paying 1k more then I did before. I can’t afford to live after thatDo you live off of your income tax?> I’m paying 1k more then I did before.\s\sNo you're not.\s\s>I can’t afford to live after that\s\sIf you're on welfare you pay no taxes if your income is that low you pay no taxes.\s\sWe're already paying for your healthcare.You can thank the government for a longer life later. If the govs aren’t protecting their people… even from themselves what are they doing? It’s in societies best interest for everyone to have access to preventive and diagnostic care.i dont even have health insurance so i dont go to the doctor. i will not be a part of this broken systemI'm sorry for you because you're planning on never getting old.  The denial of healthcare may be America's greatest crime against its citizens.My hesitancy is having dealt with government agencies they are extremely unreliable and rarely held accountable. \sCurious ??? why Berners trust any government institutions after the DNC debacles in 2016 & 2020 (fucking over Bernie for Hillary and Joe)Because the DNC is a private entity that owes the general public exactly nothing.ah yes my favorite government agency the DNC> Curious ???\s\sWhy do you trust capitalist entities like corporations in the same way?Its not about their bills... they don;t care. As long as the blacks and the poors are fucked... thats all that matters. have to maintain the social order don't you know. /sSo people are paying thousands more to maintain systematic racism? Sounds like you’re reaching.Why do you think they cut education budgets and don’t increase tea beer salaries?? So they can continue to scam us all!!Are there actual people that really believe that private insurance at these rates is a good thing?Morons who have zero healthcare never go to the doctor have lost half their teeth but still think they're about to become a billionaire any day now.Rich people can afford healthcare now.\s\sThat's all that matters.When I've talked about it with people who are against universal healthcare it's never about actual costs. It's literally because they don't want to contribute to somebody else's healthcare especially if that person isn't from America.Do they know how insurance works?Well tell them they already do.  Hospitals can't turn away someone because they've immigrated illegally.For some people it's the right to pay more while denying others the right to healthcare. Compassionate conservative politics.Vote vote voteWe get reports!\s\s    user reports:  \s    1: If we had Medicare4All you fools would be going around with conspiracies about how guvmut run healthcare is trying to kill you with vaccines.

You would have to wait for all of those facts before you could make this judgement.And another 🐷“Sleeping” family member?Say his name.....Duncan Lemp. Check your facts. Not your privilege! Systemic racism nor white privilege is even close to being an undisputable fact. So why do elites Including bipoc upper-class want to pretend it is? Because they can dangle a cure all for racism while preserving classism for their elitism. Systemic Racism is only 1 out of several forms of bigotry that is a symptom of a disease within our institutions.  Classism is the most deadly symptom.  But the disease itself is Systemic collective narcissism. And our constitution is the remedy for that.Oh thanks for letting me know the cops actually did a good thing for once and killed a terrorist shame they didn't do that at the capitol though.https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\s\sThose seem like abundant facts.\s\sMayor of Louisville Metro in 2020?

Holy shit gunna have some pork tonight boys!There are aspects of this tweet which are just factually inaccurate. That doesn't justify Breonna's death — in any way — but if you want to persuade anyone who cares about evidence repeating falsehoods about the case doesn't help. \s\sThis is a [20-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6_QM8h_u5E) by a former NYPD cop turned lawyer Nate Broady explaining the known facts about the shooting.Rand Paul actually put up a [Justice for Breonna Taylor Act](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/502392-rand-paul-introduces-bill-to-end-no-knock-warrants) to federally ban no knock warrants. Even though I disagree with him on lots of issues this is one I can support. But there is nothing but crickets from Democrats.And put these kids with guns and a badge back in school.

How the fuck was Taylor and her boyfriend supposed to hear it in the middle of the night? He was totally in the right for defending himself and his girlfriend.\s\sFuck you broThere was no reason for a no knock warrant. Their reaction to fire at people invading their home is completely justified. \s\sEven just from a strategic breaching standpoint the lack of accountability for all officers involved is an issueOh yes let's all support her drug dealing boyfriend who blamed the shooting on her after she died for his shooting at RANDOM people who burst in the door screaming ""police"". People forget this chick was found with a dead drug dealer in her rental car and knew 2 different in jail drug dealers who were recorded bragging about keeping shit at her house.This has got to be one of the stupidest posts I’ve seen on Reddit. The one situation where we can all agree that cops can shoot is when they are shot at first. Everyone knows that owning a gun increases the likelihood of being shot. Had the boyfriend not had a gun Breonna would have survived the police raid.\s\sBtw I can always count on Bernie supporters to downvote comments that make sense. Downvote to your heart’s content. In Bernie subs being downvoted means you’re comment is reasonable.> The one situation where we can all agree that cops can shoot is when they are shot at first.\s\sThere's a big ol caveat in that... do the people shooting at the cops *know* that they are shooting at cops? If not then as far as they know they would just be shooting at people with guns who *may* be shooting at them.Damn that leap in logic between ""Boyfriend had a gun"" and ""shoot a sleeping woman"" do you also think black ink on newspapers is somehow a leftist conspiracy?Please tell me you're joking?You can fuck off4th but technically original 🐷This sounds Less like Real life and more like the plot to a Liam Nieson Movie.No[deleted][deleted]You just told the universe you are perfectly willing to allow cops to go into go to your house and kill you or another loved one “for evidence”\s\sYou best be hopin the Law of Attraction isn’t realI thought her boyfriend shot at the police and When they shot back one of the bullets hit her? \s\sNot trying to be hurtful that’s just what I’ve heardImo if you aren't wearing a badge and uniform you arent the police and cannot be expected to be treated like the police.  You're effectively a civilian even if your job title might  be ""police officer.""\s\sOtherwise criminals can easily take advantage of pretending to be the police because they don't need to prove actual authority.This comment got downvoted because it had the truth LMFAO.  She was dating a drug dealer who shot at the police and they shot back.  The left totally ignores this.  They even say some bullshit like they weren’t even cops LOL what do you mean? They had their badges and everythingWhen I saw the posts from my family demonizing this person I didn't know what to do.People are selfish and evil get used to it.\s\s\sEdit: oh also this is not to disregard the efforts to fight injustice. This is more for the snowflakes that don't understand pain. Also for the evil people that don't understand they are evil.That's a pussy way of looking at a system that needs changed.The cops were already tried and one was found guilty of reckless endangerment.  So unless you have some information that the jury is wrong on this one you're SOL.Of which the jury is now suing the ag over due to the corruption associated with the case. Fuck you bro.[removed]What the hell is wrong with this thread. I don’t tolerate white supremacist talking points and neither should this sub.Arguing for justice for Breonna Taylor's murder will never be white supremacy.Cops are tools/pawns they do what they are told. We gotta change the laws and how they enforce em. Fascists love following orders we just got to give them new ones. To be clear talking about the criminal justice system in general not Brianna Taylor's tragedyThey weren't looking for Taylor's ex-boyfriend they were looking for evidence so why is this tweet trying to misdirect what the purpose of the warrant was for? Also by the time the police entered the apartment Breonna and her boyfriend were awake and standing outside of their bedroom.""Well officer it's totally OK that you mowed down my family. After all you were after evidence that could be obtained at any time and my family *was* standing outside their bedroom when you blew them away!""[deleted]They did finally the corrupt AG threw the case.I'm sorry are you people seriously upvoting a post lobbying against letting all the facts come out before making judgement? Fuck no knock warrants but this shit is fucking retarded.I found a 🐷[deleted]Um...which party is that?  I'm guessing the uni party since fighting and cheating the working class is the favorite past time of both blue and red and one of the things they tend to openly agree on.You cannot stop using fossil fuel - millions of people would freeze to death or starve to death without it. \sIf you’re poor enough to not afford health insurance you could be on public assistance. \sSocialism leads to communism. \sYou’re being conditioned to view your freedom as selfishness.Nobody is saying to stop using fossil fuels they’re saying that the threat level of global warming is at an all time high and it’s time for a transition into cleaner renewable energy sources. You don’t need to point out to the rest of us who support Bernie and the green new deal that fossil fuel transition doesn’t happen overnight. We know this. The fact is that fossil fuel companies are selfish conglomerates that put the money in their pockets over your and your families health and safety. They funnel millions of dollars into the effort of denying climate change even though scientist have proven it to be true over the last 30 years. This has nothing to do with socialism and even if it was there is no substantial evidence that socialism leads to communism you’re just spitting out opinions at that point. You’re being conditioned to believe that capitalism buys your freedom when in fact capitalism is what gives millionaires freedom and keeps everyone else towards the bottom. There’s a reason the middle class is dead and struggling in this country and I’ll give you a hint it has nothing to do with socialism. I make almost 3 figures a year yet still can’t buy a house. I pay $4000 a year in health insurance I don’t use and anytime I have used it nothing is covered because I can never meet my insanely high deductible. Technically if I were sick I wouldn’t be able to afford the insurance that I have cause the coverage Is terrible. I’m just living day to day hoping I don’t end up in the hospital because of the fear of getting sued by the hospital. And you can say that’s normal all you want but consider this: Americans are the ones dealing with this problem because we are the only ones with such a broken and segregated economy and health care system.FO 26 DAY OLD ACCOUNT!! \s\sTROLL!!Take your bullshit on down the road asshole. Fossil fuels are already old news.Let's suppose you're driving 80mph in your car. If you were to suddenly stop the car going from 80mph to 0mph in an instant you would be thrown forward and get seriously hurt.\s\sWhen we say ""stop the car"" - that's not what we mean. We mean apply the brakes and slow down until the car is no longer moving.\s\s""stop using fossil fuel"" means to transiting to other fuel sources in a gradual manner that allows us to keep people alive and save the environment with the goal of eventually not using fossil fuel.Do NOT comment with abuse vulgar insults or threats like the Nazis you are. **pretends to care about people while cursing and threatening someone for their opinion 🤡🤡**I want to see all of these people that were voter shaming on a daily basis come out and support their Corporate King but they won't because they are spinless frauds who are in positions of privilege. Anyone who's been following this shit show and been a part of the Progressive movement could have predicted what Biden was going to start doing because we've already learned better.Few men change their playbook after 50 years. Especially when it lands them the presidency.What has Biden started doing?“That’s why I didn’t start a third party after being cheated in 2016 and didn’t run as an independent after getting screwed in 2020 because this is all so important”Normal as in airstriking Middle Eastern civiliansI take it this was prior to the Great Capitulation after which Biden was the Savior Of The World who would heal the land once the evil Trump is ousted much like the end of The (original otherwise known as the actually good) Lion King.\s\sBiden is terribleas terrible if not worse than Trumpas we predicted but Bernie won't have any cred to point it out after that whole long stint of hard selling literal shit on a shingle as the cure or what ails us and calling dissenters to the idea reckless children.  His only remaining hope is to actually defy the establishment consistently no kid gloves and go for the well-meaning useful idiot who saw the light and fucking stick to it.  Like Daou.Bernie advocated for Warren as Secretary of Treasury. The guy is a hypocrit. I'm no longer surprised by his lack of an opposition during the primary. You let the country down when you were needed the most.Yes I'm sure she didn't mean anything bad when she lied to the press and told them you scoffed at the idea of a female president and certainly would never stab you in the back again.Then... maybe... you should have actually attempted to run for the presidency instead of just handing the whole thing over to Joe the oligarch bro. Only person you have to blame for this ruin is staring at you in your bathroom mirror.Third party time. Enough is enough. I voted Joe to get Don out but never again. Movement for a People’s Party is where I will be moving forwardPeople always say that but then the next Republican us just so much more obnoxious that they always go ""well just this once more then I'm done"".  It's literally the basis of uni party strategy for curtailing our votes between two identical parties and accepting any form if fascism as long as its not *that guy's* form.if fascism.  They've mastered the art of political vaudeville.> I voted Joe to get Don out but never again.\s\sNever again until next time when they give you a choice between shit and shittier.Yeah way to stick it to em! They’re gonna get the message in the millisecond it takes to count your vote for himfuck third party for now.  Look at what Alaska deep blood red Alaska went and voted themselves ranked choice.  It passed by a cunt hair but it passed and now they can hopefully move the needle.  If your state can get to ranked choice vote for libs or green or what the fuck ever but if you vote for them now without ranked choice you really are throwing it away.

Twice.What actually happened? I'm not american but I've seen huge support for Bernie and then out of nowhere he ""dropped out of the race"". What was the cause or reason provided?As long as you keep fighting in the primary...Then why did you endorse the “nothing will fundamentally change” guy?Lol this was during the primaries. When it looked like he was boutta win. 😢that's nice.  maybe Bernie should run for president.  but actually run.Don't be naive. He doesn't have a chance in the corrupt 2 party system.And this is why the stop Bernie movement can never be forgiven or forgotten""This Joe Biden character seems pretty terrible. Good thing I endorsed...""\s\s[checks notes]\s\s""...I've made a huge mistake.""This is true just kinda is contradictory for him to be saying after he immediately endorsed Biden after dropping out. he was endorsing biden BEFORE he dropped out.This is an old tweet.Endorsement doesn’t mean you’re 100% agreeing with them. Well maybe if yorue a trumpie.... lmao.Okay Biden shills you made your bed now lie in it!Looks like Bernie is a giant hypocrite who sold out his own movement by endorsing a corporate plutocrat.Bernie is cancelled 😞You know what Bernie should do for the rest of his time in office? Take every single one of those bullshit omnibus bills break it up into individual bills and reintroduce the parts that aren't total bullshit. AOC should do the same in the House. Then the two of them can go out in public and talk about how they tried to avoid more corporate handouts but the speaker and the house majority leader wouldn't bring the individual bills to a vote.But I will bet neither of them do anything of the kind...Dude you phrased it like a swear in the begining i legit thought those littke pieces were gonna end up some were else.[removed]Already too late for that.

These days Bernie is just running interference for the bad guys. It'd be awesome if that changed recently...Bernie must know that he's not going to get the Labor Secretary position he's been lobbying for! Uncle Joe is a Scorpio like myself and we don't trust Bernie so we're going to leave him right there in Congress where he belongs!I can't tell if this is a joke or not but if it is be careful there are people who actually think like this lolI guess something changed between the time he posted this [March 9 Tweet](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1237067549688332290) and when he spent like... *seven months* [repeatedly](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/14/bernie-sanders-says-opposing-joe-biden-irresponsible/2993775001/) asking [everyone](https://www.voanews.com/2020-usa-votes/sanders-urges-progressives-keep-agenda-alive-vote-biden) to [vote](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/05/bernie-sanders-job-biden-donald-trump-presidential-campaign/3623526001/) for Biden?\s\sI get that you're not mindless robots who have to do whatever Bernie says but ya'll spend a lot of time quoting him when it suits you and ignoring him when it doesn't.Just a few weeks ago your comment would have been heavily upvoted on this sub. It looks like the DNC troll farms are still in full swing and have set their sights on this sub.Yea it’s almost like some people can have some takes we agree on and some that we don’t. It’s really not that hard. He said that and he’s right he also said everyone vote for Biden which most of his supporters did. I’m hardly seeing any argument hereI'm gonna be really happy when Bernie Sanders dies. He's pretty old so it won't be long hopefully.> I'm gonna be really happy when Bernie Sanders dies \s\sAnd nobody will give a shit when you do.I bet your parents are disappointed in you. At the very least they should be.\s\sAlso FYI there’s more people like him and we’re growing in numbers...and we are far less conservative than he is.\s\sThe future is bright comrade get used to it.Damn right. Too bad there are a ton of people in the country who don’t get and likely never willThey are brainwashedVote blue and then fuck youThan why bend the knee without extracting concessions from Biden ?Idk. imo they threatened Bernie with something. Maybe throwing his wife in jail about that land deal. Or maybe Bernie would have had another “heart attack” had Biden not won? \s\sI’m just glad that Bernie’s back. I know this isn’t a popular opinion here but Biden being in the White House prevents the brunch liberals from losing their minds over every Trump tweet. Now Bernie and everyone else can focus on the matter at hand.Because the military industrial complex fossil fuel companies and big banks et al control Biden can bribe Trump and own both parties - prefer Biden but would rather Trump win than give in to progressives at all. Bernie chose to help Biden get in (lesser of two evils) and hope to reason with his admin or build a progressive squad that is big enough to have negotiating power but there is no leverage (yet) for progressives to force their hand at anything.\s\sThat is changing slowly based on the power of progressive policies to win this cycle but Democratic neo-libs are still trying to identity-politics their way into the hearts of the American Public - at least enough to calm the mass unrest while changing nothing.\s\sThe Democrats Mass Media hell the voting machines wouldn’t let Bernie win. The most that Bernie could do was torpedo Biden’s chances by speaking out against him or doing nothing - but the alternative was Dumb Hitler. So what would you do?\s\sBernie chose harm-reduction (even sad incremental harm-reduction) and threw his considerable weight behind Biden because he cares about individuals and lived to fight another day. \s\sEssentially Biden’s masters would rather see him lose to Trump than accept the Green New Deal. Because of this Bernie had no leverage.Haven’t you read Biden’s platform? On paper Biden’s been moved really far left relative to American politics. Now whether he’s lying or not...What concessions could Biden give you that you would believe he would follow through onBernie is so great.  If only he ran for President.  Oh well.  He at least has that trophy wife.He got his goal of getting Trump out and now he's going to push Biden. I like it.[deleted]He got the goal of replacing one corporate puppet with another. YayAlso means getting more involved with the Middle EastBlast from the past.\s\s It is getting to be that you need to consult a timeline to keep track of Bernie's ever changing positions.I was gonna say that's not recent right??Basically what Biden was saying without saying:  That was a nice tantrum you threw America.  But classic political corruption is *back on the menu!*Lmao missed ur shot my dude. Got cuckedIf you are talking about Bernie you’re right. He missed his chance to get any kind of concession from Biden by demanding it before dropping out and endorsing. BTW those concessions would have benefitted you and your family and every other working-class American so maybe you shouldn’t be so happy about the shit sandwich you are eating brah! Unless you are rich in that case get fucked then go die. Or just die.Bernie is getting to Grandpa Simpson levels of screaming at a cloud.  Bernie you had opportunities to make change happen.  Instead you threw in with the very people preventing the change you wanted.And fucking laughed about it publicly without fear of consequences.  ""I beat the socialist!""Yet bernie rolled over like a dog to biden[removed][deleted]So predictable. Now that Biden won he's back to being angry. But wait. In two years he'll be back to endorsing the same crappy neoliberal corporatist Democrats. After that election he'll go back to being angry.\s\sAnybody see a pattern here?This is from March I think.Time for him to join the People's Party. Fuck the DemocratsI've read speculation the Bernie  was going to be a progressive pain in the ass. I hope he is. We shall see.Oh yeah he's going to write some tweets and give some speeches on the Senate floor. I bet the ruling class are shaking in their boots!Fuck Bernie for endorsing Biden.  All of this means shit now.[removed]When did he tweet this? I don't see a date.It's from last spring when he was still running in the primary:\s\shttps://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/posts/we-cannot-return-to-normal-we-need-real-change/2912554885466163/😆😆😆 seeing as how 250000 - 400000 people die a year from medical malpractice according to johns Hopkins wouldn't the number of deaths from medical malpractice also go up and undermine the supposed 70k that are being saved? Also shes an idiot if she thinks a government program is going to ""save billions of dollars""Why are you even here?All that money we save...""BUT WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR I- oh wait""Well would you look at that the Democratic party murdered 70000 people in 2020. Chump numbers if you ask the Republicans but respectable nontheless. It's diary must look very strange; woke up this morning death death death death death cup of coffee death death death death death death Sex in the City death death death...> Well would you look at that the Democratic party murdered 70000 people in 2020. \s\sWe have seen nothing yet.\s\sJoe Biden is popping Viagra at the thought of throwing 15 million people out of their homes in the middle of a pandemic.  He is going to shatter Obama's 5.1 million numberClearly your priorities are twisted. What is more important? 70000 lives a year or hundreds of billions of dollars of profits?\s\sAre you a commie?The progressives should demand a vote on this in the house or threaten to withdraw their vote to elect nancy pelosi as speaker. Easy way to get medicareM4A...??? That's more a Beijing thanks to Mao Caracas thanks to HUGO Moscow (left over from commie) Havana thanks to Fidel Che and the other heroic revolutionaries or Shelbyville just to be silly kinda thing. Except that in times of humanity threatening pandemic those evil commie bastid Cubanos make house calls... with medicine... the horror the horror. Nothing is too vicious for them. So as a result you can be assured that U$ propaganda will fabricate or propigate evil about them like El sexto jailed for months for insulting Fidel and Raul. That might be true but what is definitely true and unstated is that during the time el sexto was apparently incarcerated U$ kkkops murdered three people a day in land of the brave and free. Largely racist motivated. One of America's biggest problems is its ku klux kops. No matter how you slice it Amerikkka imprisons more and certainly murders many more extra judicially than the zero cuban extra judicial murders. \s\sThe $450000000000 will be money taken from the poor but that same poor will have 70000 fewer mouths to feed.\s\sLet's attempt a total.\s\s50~100 million murdered in the genocide probably half a million dead in the slave passage 5~7000 lynched and massacred post slavery. Actually relative few murders but as barbaric cruel and painful as possible during slavery. Profit and property management. Since the civil war America's incursions and U$biz involvement in WWI and WWII would seem to put much of the well over a hundred million deaths on America's plate. U$ military industrial complex being by far the planet's worst polluter... well you can see that how much to credit America with keeping the population down is difficult to ascertain.\s\sYou can also see that it is very difficult to put even vague numbers on it and we must just accept that no country since the beginning of time has come close to the theft and murders on Americas blotter.\s\sKkkop murders are over a thousand a year currently and if we assume that there were none the day that largely U$biz fomented war ended round it down to a thousand annually and assume the increase was gradual and consistent in the 75 years since WWII it estimates to  37500 killings by cops. That's not the good look America believes it is. It is the look of stark racist barbarity.Unfortunately the pandemic is revealing to America just how expendable so many of us think our fellow Americans are.And how hypocritical our ""caring"" about other people's heath really is.Of course it would. There is only one reason we can't have it--profit. I don't have any easy answers but we need to fight this militantly. There are now millions of new uninsured people and people forced into expensive Obamacare. This should be easier than it is but our politicians are intractable.\s\sedit to add: I'm watching Sirota on Jimmy Dore now. He makes a good point about politicians being willing to do harm. They aren't there to govern for all the people only the owners of the country. So the only things left are strikes and revolution.How stupid is this!  Obamacare has destroyed our healthcare and this will increase the decline.You base this on what?The lancet study has a lot of problems with it. I suggest you guys read this fact check on it it goes over it well: https://khn.org/news/bernie-sanders-embraces-a-new-study-that-lowers-medicare-for-alls-price-tag-but-skepticism-abounds/Your alleged refutation of the Yale study is an article on a Kaiser Perm website. Ignoring that conflict of interest you've linked an article by a journalist as opposed to research study with the time rigors and resources of an academic paper.\s\sI think on this sub at least many would not give a darn if there were 0 savings as long as people had access to quality care and didn't have to wager their (and their family's) financial future to get it. to be clear our current system does not remotely accomplish either of these goals. Again i think many on this sub would admit M4A is not perfect nor would the implementation be easy - insurance companies would/do fight teeth and nail to hamoer it by any means - but unless someone has a better plan it seems to be the best we've got. \s\sAt a minimum unless you have something that stops tying Healthcare to employment ensures minors total coverage abolishes the fanciful concept of ""pre-existing conditions"" reduces the cost of prescriptions and ends medical related bankruptcy especially for emergency care when people inherently cannot price shop then M4A looks pretty sweet.\s\sAlso your username checks out. If only you could see a doctor for help with that. Too bad they don't take reddit awards lmaoI'd love to see you take the time to discredit 22 studies stating Medicare for All would save money not just one.\s\shttps://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/484301-22-studies-agree-medicare-for-all-saves-money\s\sIn science it's called replication.

What’s also insane is that the very people who would benefit from healthcare for all scream ‘socialism’ whenever it is mentioned. Did I say insane?52% of Republicans support Medicare For AllWell yes *but* it would also deprive the middleman insurance industrial complex from extracting wealth from people in exchange for their well-being.And we cannot allow that now can weWhAt aBoUt tHe uNiOnS tHaT nEgOtIaTeD cOvErAgE?!?!I like how there's a million people screaming about the ""cost"" of M4A but whenever a study like this comes up they flatly refuse to see it. I recall one of the ""Biden shamers"" back in October straight up calling the study ""fake news"" and if that doesn't demonstrate how little difference there is between the MAGA crowd and Biden's people then I don't know what does.Yes centrists moderates neoliberal the whole entire right wing don’t want m4a. They don’t want progress. They want to keep things the way they are or regress things to how they were. Center-left and left from there want “progress” for the people. Shorten the wealth gap more rights for the common citizen human rights like healthcare and a livable wage. Unfortunately because of propaganda only a portion of Americans want progress for themselves. They want to keep things how they are and brings things back to how they used to be mostly socially. The good thing is that the youth want progress especially the educated ones. They want equality even if they currently have privileges now. So the hope is that in 25 years our youth of today will be the country’s leaders and we will progress thenit was really surprising how ignorant and spiteful some of them can be on this topic I've had ""debates"" where they sounded exactly like a Trump zealot backtracking pivoting and posting random talking points whenever you corner them on any particular point ignoring every link you post to back your argument and offering none to back their's ending every sentence with ""you dumbfuck"" or similar treating ""socialist"" as some kind of insult.\s\sit really gave me the impression that Trump doesn't have a monopoly on militant belligerent easilly manipulated people who have no idea wtf they are talking about. at least Trump supporters  have the whole ""destroying our way of life"" mentality to fuel them whereas  these are simply different implementations of the same basic end goals.Does this include tax revenue from the 70000 people who won't die and quit working? Or how they can stimulate the economy by not being dead?We need to be fighting tooth and nail for this. The fact that there's so much pushback against forcing a vote on the House floor shows just how many people have been propagandized to fight against any push towards it.But the wealthy would suffer from longer wait times\s/sI’m so sick of hearing this argument and the whole “well WhO’S gUnnA pAy fuRrit?...nUt mE I tELL u wHuT!”Capitalism depends on and therefore creates difference. \s\sIt uses difference as a cudgel - ""serve the system or end up like those people without insurance."" It uses difference as markers for the meritocracy - ""you worked hard now you deserve to live in less fear and more comfort."" \s\sBut most of all it uses difference to keep people from coalescing around shared material conditions - ""now you'll never get enough numbers together to oppose the owners of this country.""\s\sSame can be said for housing food education.\s\sSo another way to look at the problem is - how do you give people healthcare without disrupting all the necessary differences? How do you tell people they're still better and more comfortable than someone else?Anyone interested to figure out if this is actually true?\s\sIf so I am certain there is way to get this passed.\s\sAs long as private insurance market is still available.Fuck the private insurance market. The only way to make sure that it's a quality program is for rich and poor alike to have the same coverage. It's also the only way to ensure lower costs through monopsony. And that the program isn't rolled back. Private insurance needs to be eliminated from the face of the earth.I’m pretty sure “Medicare for all” implies that it’s supposed to insure everyone with Medicare. Making it so there’s only a public option and not private options is part of what makes it so much cheaper so private insurers can’t refuse to insure certain people that are more costly to insure and dump them onto public insurers making the public system a more expensive system.https://pjmedia.com/trending/great-news-medicare-for-all-would-save-450-billion-a-year-and-save-68000-lives/Or we could think of it as: Private for-profit health insurance kills nearly 70000 Americans and wastes (or makes rich people richer) $450 billion each and every year.He’s a disgusting piggy[removed]Stop applying for jobs online.

They own all the important land they own and control the corporations that've long since bought and paid for the senate the congress the state houses the city halls they got the judges in their back pocket and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and the information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want. Well we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.STEM classes involving hydroponics and food production could provide the schools with fresh greens and vegetables should they choose to adopt such pre-existing programs.My school had an agricultural science class and people just dismissed it as a class for rednecks that wanted to ride John Deere tractors all day.

These things are just common sense acts of humanity and civility. You don't need ideology just basic principles.[deleted]I'm with you.  I don't actually believe it's ethical to make more humans to live on this planet right now.Yep wife and I have decided not to have children due to healthcare and childcare predatory costs.  We would just be setting them on the debt train for the rest of their lives.  Disgusting.Not really. They'll just learn to survive the old fashioned wayI was 18 when Obama ran against McCain. All through High School I was really interested in politics but was just a standard Blue MAGA that thought the GOP were the bad guys and the Dems were the good guys. Like I'd watch fucking CNN and Crossfire when I got home from school (no wonder I didn't have any friends). \s\sMy mom was a big supporter of Nader and said both sides worked for the same people. I just thought she was too jaded or cynical. A lot of my world view was forged during the Dubya years and the War on Terror... I was absolutely disgusted by him and I totally bought all of Obama's bullshit hook line and sinker. \s\s08 was the last time I voted for a Dem. Felt pretty betrayed by Obama but I also realized why my mom was so ""cynical."" He really wasn't all that different from Dubya.I was 34. My son had been born the month before the election. I had voted for Clinton in 1992 was fairly new Democrat at that time and agreed with the Clinton style/approach only to move further and further left after I got out of school and experienced life a bit. I remember a poli sci teacher at uni telling me the only way to change politics was blow something up. I saw how swiftly things got done for the bad with an unpopular cheater like Bush ... but I had hope built up with the blogs for a revolution. Obama wasn't my first choice in 2008 but by the time he got the nom I was sold. And we got 60 Senators. Holy shit this was a dream. But hijinx ensued with getting Franken seated and then Teddy dropped dead and so for a drink of water we had 60 but nothing got done because the Liebermans and about 7 others all made sure that we needed bipartisanship. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sThat was when I was out. Never voted for Dems again outside of case by case basis. Also my tolerance for pols who backtrack on promises is now 0.Same the Obama betrayal opened my eyes to the shit that had been going on. Before that I thought Clinton was some kind of saint and then the sheen started to fade the more I read. \s\sThen the warmonger Hillary acolyte of Kissinger did her bit too. And the adulation she received from people around me just seemed too much of a cult without any attention to what she was actually doing. \s\sThen Bernie and on and on..\s\sRead the book *Listen Liberal* if you get a chance.I gotta say I love your mom. She's a smart lady! I voted for Nader in 2000. Even before this I knew but 21 years ago I said the same thing. Bill Clinton showed us that the Democrats are just as bad as the Republicans and were basically on the same side. Nothing has changed except gotten worse maybe.\s\sSmart woman and raised a smart person!I been poor and felt embarrassed of subsidized or free lunch. But those kids traumatized before school starts should be ready to learn right? All lives matter as long as they can pay their own way. GTFOH! Priorities Priorities!San Diego schools have a total budget $1.6 billion btw. About 3 times that of the police budget.Do you have sources?Sounds less like capitalism vs socialism more like local corruption.I will never forget the feeling of being $20 in lunch debt and having my food taken away. They gave me fucking crackers and I had to watch everyone else eat full meals. Nobody helped.Not to sound rude but why couldn’t your parents provide lunch?How in the sweet ever loving fuck can a child in the United States accrue debt while attending public school? \s\sI'm not American but you guys have some serious shit to work out.[deleted]I think at one time the cafeteria was part of the school budget. Now they've hired outside vendors who want to be paid. The debt comes from their parents not paying school fines or for students' lunches. It's the parents' debt the kids are paying the price for. And it is still disgusting on each and every level.Pure unfiltered Capitalism that is practiced only in the United States is all fun and games when there's plenty to go around with enough for all the mouths to feed. Say for example you just won a world war and all the remaining wealth and means of production are in your country. It's great then. \s\sNow on the other hand when you are competing with other rising economies across the globe you start to see the cracks in the system.\s\sThat's what nobody really wants to talk about. Capitalism goes hand in hand with war it's predicated on the necessity for war and it cannot thrive without the continued perpetuation of war.I’m a former ultra conservative. Seeing what those people believe and having believed those same ideas at one point I now see that they must be stopped at all costs.What changed your mind? If you don't mind me asking?Bernie going soft on the Democratic Party.  If Bernie can be turned after hanging tough for four decades there is no way to salvage this mess.  Clear the chess board the sunk cost fallacy is killing us.Can we do a gofundme and get these KIDS “debts” paid?Not directed at you but how can Children legally have ""debt"" in the first place?Just vote for candidates that will give more money to public schools.I lived in the Dominican Republic for two years a very impoverished country compared to the US where collection of taxes is extremely difficult. Despite this they provide bread and milk for the kids at school once a day. Given how much Americans pay in taxes the pictured lunch is a fucking joke.Wait so if all lunch ladies just stopped following those rules and gave all kids fair lunches who gonna stop them? They can't fire *all* of them.\s\sAnd if politicians try to say some shit about it just use ""so you do t care about kids eating properly?""\s\sI was lucky at my school our lunch ladies didn't give a single fuck. You could go through line with 2 full trays and as long long you paid you were OK (rule was 1 tray per person) everyone pretty much knew the free lunchers and the lunch ladies wouldnt care if they got normal lunch so long as they paid the $2.25-$4. Forget how much it wasHow long ago was that? In California at least even giving out a free slice of pizza is ""stealing"" and a write up offense. These ladies make less than 35k a year in California and are usually older with health issues that require medical insurance. You want them to risk their health insurance so kids can eat a little better? Instead the parents should be standing up to the school boards and other entities that dictate the school meals. Vote out the superintendent vote out the school board vote out city council and take over. \s\sIt isn't the lunch lady's job to secure funding for student meals it is the parents/community votersYeah not sure I was just doing my job is a great defense.I kind of have a hard time believing this happened being that my daughter had lunch $ acct in debt a # of times bc it's hard to stay on top of everything and i wpuld just get robocalls until i paid it but she got to still get whatever she wanted at lunch. Sounds like a really shit school principal if this actually happenedMy mom worked for years for SD schools as the pastry chef many moons ago. After she retired she wanted to keep busy and worked on call as a lunch lady a few times a month or to cover vacations and such. There was one elementary school she hated being called to because they more often than not ran out of food at third lunch. Of course this was in a disadvantaged neighborhood and some of these kids would have this as their only meal. She had to give them corn. Just a pile of corn on the tray. Any concern she raised was met with an apathetic shrug. She finally quit and just volunteered at a senior center to keep herself busy.San Diego schools have a budget of 1.6 billion. More than enough to feed kids.Where the fuck is it going then?&#x200B;\s\sbooksIsrael can promote laws in the US but we can't even get the minimum wage increased.I don’t know why people aren’t freaking out over this.

Try defunding the Central govt and abolishing central banking. 💁The central government would really like to take over policing since the the locals are doing such a poor job.Slavery never truly went away.

It's a system of training a culture and a cultural approach to our entire criminal justice system that's seriously in need of an overhaul. Sure convict the killer cops but destroy the system that has made them all too commonplace as well.That's because slavery  was meant to control a particular race of people  for their rich masters.Police racism is different.\s\sPolicing is part of our system of INSTITUTIONAL racism which is meant to control us ALL.\s\sFor OUR rich masters.\s\sIt divides us up and sets us against one-anotherrather neatly.\s\sAnd its self-reinforcingtoo.\s\sWhile I believe that institutional racism arose organicallyI also believe it didn't take too long for the rich bastards that run this country to recognize it as an excellent tool for controlling the peasantry.\s\sIts entire PURPOSE is to exacerbate race relations and keep the Public divided.\s\sthat's why it isn't going anywhere.\s\sIt exists to protect the rich donors that both parties rely on for donations.\s\sI would also posit that we ended race-based slavery not because it was brutal and morally repugnant; we ended it in favor of a cheapermore efficient system of slavery that would encompass the entire non-rich population.[deleted]if you say what the hivemind echo wants to hear you get rewarded. if you bring up difficult and complex issues on twitter with dumbed down simplistic ideology you get a cookie. sure people get that twatter is accessible to the masses and they haven't banned or censored any of the lefty ideological rhetoric yet. independents are some of the more knowledgeable political candidates out there in this country this ain't it.\s\s>Policing is part of our system of INSTITUTIONAL racism which is meant to control us ALL. \s\swould that mean its no longer about race then. are we actually back to occupy 2011 before the masses got swayed away from injustice and inequality and threw themselves into the media gauntlet of partisan division and segregation by race. that likely will not happen until race is removed from the ideological rhetoric and citizens return to focusing on people as human beings not different races who cant read drivers licenses or have childhood knife fights. if really concerned about people take a break from making mean tweets on your iphone it was made in china with the lefts beloved slave labor.\s\sno were just going to go about our child hood knife fights alrighty then.Are you high on crack?

Even the most die-hard thin-blue-line-idiots don't think that.Even when people are killed while complying people defend the police saying the guy had a record or the cop perceived him as a threat.\s\sYes people do believe this. Especially cops.""well he should have just complied"" is one of the most common responses any time someone gets killed by police. Nobody likes to explicitly admit that they think like this but a lot of people justify itFrom qualified immunity to the 1000 annual killings by police that result in little to no consequences I'd argue there's a legitimate point being made here. Nowhere else in the industrialized world do we see such rampant police brutality.You’d be surprisedIs it damp under that rock?BuT iT’s HaRd To Be A cOp It’S dAnGeRoUs\s\s/s“Burnout from the workplace” should mean immediate re-assignment and counselling for any officer\s\sPoor work performance increases the risk of fatal negligence \s\sIgnorance can’t be a shield for passivity and lack of vigilanceImagine a cop asking someone to put their weapon down and they instead shoot the cop.

And just maybe the public would be less likely to run away scared from armed individuals deciding wether they should die or not die on personal perception of a crime.Maybe yes but also what if the cop didn’t do things they were supposed to do. I got a compromise cops stop being bad and criminals start being good. And if you are an innocent person who’s life was taken away ummm... good luck?\s\s\s\sYes less people would die if they listened to cops. But maybe if cops could handle certain situations better among other things then maybe they wouldn’t be in all of those positions in the first place.That is absolute horseshit. Of course there is an absolute lack of accountability around police violence/murder. There is SO much work to be done around policing beginning with ending the war on drugs. But no one thinks cops should get to kill compliant people. And very few people believe cops should get to kill non-compliant people.

That means my self awareness (if I dont black out) cant supersede the involuntary reaction my brain has. Even if im not being difficult the stress in itself can cause my body to shut down. Imagine all i do is collapse to the ground many people would definitely deem that as non-compliance. Ya know if I have a male cop trying to touch me in uncomfortable ways is it a surprise that I could have a ptsd episode? I feel like people seriously do not think about situations like this.Shoulda followed the law sweet heart.

But society believes this because we aren’t taught anything about this stuff in our educational system.

So yay!Billionaire Trump himself said in 2016 Presidential Debate with that LOSER Hilary that it was smart of him to pay no taxes. I loved that Trump was so open about telling the shenanigans 1% play and how dirty are our politicians. 1% pay no taxes because their wealth is tied to stocks. You only pay taxes when you sell those stock which creates taxable event but they off set it by donating same amount of money made from that transaction so end result is ZERO tax.Ouch. That stings cuz it’s so sad but true[deleted]Smugness is mostly to other countrie at home we mostly complainThe US does good in education. In both terms of quality and how educated the population is.\s\sI can’t find a ranking for the Netherlands though perhaps lack of data taken there?The Netherlands has mandatory private insurance. https://wise.com/gb/blog/healthcare-system-in-the-netherlands Really glad this is true but I’ll be more impressed when the Dutch do this for 300+ million people. They’ve done it for 17+ million.So what you're saying is that our economy and workforce is so much larger we can easily do this? Awesome.Size of New York basically. So what you’re saying is that all of our states the size of New York or smaller can do this. That’s awesome because only 3 states are bigger.https://spendmenot.com/blog/what-percentage-of-americans-are-millionaires/It doesn't cost more per capita you idiot. If anything it probably costs far less per person if you have a larger insurance pool.\s\sI mean are you really so stupid that you don't know how health insurance works?Let’s not leave out the tax rate of the Netherlands.(50-60%) But their government also requires all adults living or working in the Netherlands to have basic insurance. The basic plan will cost € 100-120 out of pocket. Seeing a doctor can be easy when it’s something deadly but anything less than that and it becomes difficult due to the shortage of doctors and increases in patients. Another factor in the Netherlands that plays a role in costs is their diet it’s one of the healthiest places in the world to eat having a low obesity rate plays into costs. \s\sThey have a big bike culture there because owning a car is a luxury granted to those that need it less cars on the roads equals more people using public transportation the more people using public transportation the better it becomes. \s\sHigh quality education comes at a costs to the tax payer too that of which the government has regulated it’s costs like their healthcare system but it’s not free.\s\sNow as an American I can choose to insure myself without the expense of everyone else’s bad habits I could get treatment for minor issues faster than any Dutchman could ever dream of emergency care as well in addition to driving myself in a vehicle that I have the choice to own.You're missing the point that it is about the people that can't afford those things not the people who can.  No doubt being well off sure is nice and gives you lots of options in life but that's not the discussion.  Also if you lost your job because of something out of your control like say a pandemic then everything you just mentioned that you thought you had is pulled out from under your feet.The thing that I don't think a lot of people realize but you're almost touching on is that a healthy population is essential to public healthcare.\s\sIt's so essential infact that the government puts a LOT of emphasis on making sure their population stays healthy by use of things like Sugartax fat tax maximum and minimum requirements of foods subsidizing fruits/greens/dairy/healthy living **making it cheaper and more convenient to ride a bike than a drive a car**. \s\sCountries with public healthcare have healthier populations because the governments actively try to stop the citizens being unhealthy as it's a massive expense they can cut. Currently there's very few of these systems in place in the US and it makes it harder and harder to start public healthcare.Great stuff as long as you can afford it which is not the case for too many peopleIn Europe we want the same tax regulation for everyone...\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Sandwich?wprov=sfla1As a Dutchman you also get to skate on the whole “slave trade since time began” thing I call that a win!& this country is built on ""the dream of a good life""!They have one of the best education systems in the word.As Americans we also get to pay for the Dutchman to get universal healthcare excellent roads good public transport and easily accessible high quality Dutch government propaganda.No it’s Israel you’re referring to. In Europe everyone pays taxes and the governments use those taxes to provide healthcare education and infrastructure to the people. You know...the things that taxes are meant to be used for. Not billions of dollars in corporation bailouts and a trillion dollar military. Along with some billions to Israel’s apartheid state.What do you mean?They're also brutally shutting down peaceful protests over the continuing draconian lockdowns... 💁> drsconian l\s\sHaha wappieOn the bright side we don't get to be that smug about it.I mean at least they have something to be smug about. :(Definitely man. The outside world could learn a thing or two about humility from America. You guys are pioneers in that space.We also get endless virtue signaling buffoons that obsess over America and use iPhones and Twitter and reddit to exercise their moral narcissism.Facts.My fellow dutchmen are so self absorbed and arrogant that they don't even know we have had a fully neoliberal government for the past 10-20 years. I can't stress enough how much I hate people like this because the current governing parties are comically incompetent and corrupt(the most recent but not necessarily most notable being the obstruction of our democracy in March-April in which the governing parties colluded to suppress a politician who was critical of the government for illegally denying thousands of people child support and falsely accusing them of fraud) yet somehow consistently win the elections literally just because people don't actually know the politics of their own country.\s\s\- We have universal healthcare but we're the only country in Europe (I think) who don't have FREE healthcare anymore. Our healthcare system is commercialized resulting in doctors being dissuaded from referring patients to specialists or starting treatment plans that are too expensive for health insurance companies. Moreover even if you get treatment that's officially covered under insurance you have to pay the first $300-$900 out of pocket(it depends on your copay) because the government considers it your 'own risk' (Being born with chronic illness is on you Jack). The counter for how much you've spent on treatment covered by insurance resets every year. Of course this is all how it should work theoretically. In practice many of laws are routinely broken without consequence. Moreover our general practitioners are extremely overworked due to heavy savings on healthcare workers.\s\s\- Yes our government loves roads. So much in fact that it perpetually builds more at the expense of biodiversity for no apparent reason.\s\s\- Our public transport is quite good relative to other countries though it could be better if it weren't commercial.\s\s\- Education is fine but disproportionately expensive compared to other European countries. Many students are struggling with student loans especially because housing prices are soaring.\s\sIf you're going to live in Europe and can live without weed you probably shouldn't move to the Netherlands at least now. It's much more a facade of excellence that dutch people love to circlejerk over than anything else. That's why we've had a strongly liberal cabinet for the past 10 years without people even realizing it.Why is that happening?Not to mention that the Netherlands are literally the country with the highest wealth inequality in the world. No kidding. Look it up.This is a good and accurate take.They require immigrants learn Dutch and pass tests within a period of time or be deported.is this like a *learn to speak merican'* comment? really? what does that have to do with anything?Dutch always had it right. Dutch could have stopped Pakistan from going nuclear as Dr. Khan stole the design from URENCO. His coworker complained about it to higher up but he was ignored. They thought it was Americans job to stop spread of nuclear weapons around the world. Johan Cruyff arena in Amsterdam is the greenest football stadium in the world.[deleted]Comments like that aren't meant to make you feel good.

You know people like Joe Biden who wrote the Crime Bill the Bankruptcy Bill and drafted the Patriot Act. When the country moves further right it's because the ""opposition party"" went along with our political enemies and refused to hold the line and obstruct against regressive policies. No one party is responsible for the horrible state of this country right now. This is the result of a bipartisan project more than half a century in the making.Or you know the guy who saw the arsonist then went to help him deserves blame for it too especially if people went on to try to say the person aiding the arsonist is actually a hero. Everyone other then conservatives knows how bad the republicans are but people still treat the democrats like they actually care about stopping anything the republicans do.I blame the fire department who showed up to the burning house too their name too literally and started spraying gasoline on it.I too attack dems more repubs are open about their intentions dems are two-faced which means that more energy has to be spent on them to reveal their true nature dems have successfully fooled many progressives into buying into the “vote the lesser evil just this once” argument I need not waste my energy on republicans beyond “I hate republicans too/this also applies to republicans”I feel like the whole dem voter strategy is literally ""vote for the lesser evil just this once"". Like the main draw to their candidates is ""WELL AT LEAST HE'S NOT THAT GUY"".Something something parahnas....With Republicans you know what the party stands for.

They’re the firefighters telling us they’re gonna stop the arsonists but leaving out free gasoline and matches.They are all in the same tax bracketGreat discussion going on here.\s\sI wish I could contribute but you're all too good.My reason is because I already agree republicans are terrible preaching to the choir rather do something productive with the time I would be wasting complaining about republicans.I've watched leftest fight for Democrats for the last 20 years.  Republicans score victory after victory totally unopposed and overtly assisted by the Democratic Party.  The leftest get stabbed in the back by the Democratic Party at every opportunity.  Yet here we are continuing to play out scorpion and the frog year after year.Wow this was really well saidWe've been saying this for years here.Liberals are the cork in the leftist bottle.Those black bars above and below the image really made me think the reddit app had glitched.The backstabbing is a deliberate part of the strategy. That way liberals can be defensive and say to the left ""You need to grow up and realize that you can't get 100% of what you want"" when Dems fail to fight for anything and ""Dems had to support bad legislation because they don't have the votes"" when Dems capitulate to the Republicans. We've seen it constantly for the last 30 years. These arguments are specifically designed to make the left seem unreasonable while the neolib ""center"" is portrayed as pragmatic. So we get nothing the Republicans get 75% of what they want and billionaires and multinational corporations get 100%. \s\sThe problem with voting for Dems is that they lie and make it seem like they want what you want but when you actually look at their record they are antithetical to a leftist policy agenda and actively work to suppress it. Look at all that bullshit Biden said during the election and compare that to his cabinet appointments and how much he's backtracked on a whole host of issues. He will even refuse to do the things that he doesn't need Congress' help on like reducing student debt which could be done with an executive order. Dems like to spout the line that we need to be satisfied with incremental progress and that change is slow but it's all bullshit designed to placate you and convince you that you shouldn't be demanding more from the government that claims to be on your side.I wish this comment was on the frontpage of political reddit. Encapsulates exactly what I think a lot of us feel.I don't disagree other than the ""what Biden said"" part.  Obama legitimately ran on a ""hope and change"" ""we'll stop the rise of the oceans"" ""everyone benefits when we spread the wealth around"" agenda before doing almost nothing bold or Leftwing as president.  Biden's agenda was largely two things--""Return us to some lesser iteration of Obama ca. 2014"" and ""Not Be Trump.""  There was no way he was ever going to push a spate of systemically significant Leftist policies and he never really gave an impression otherwise.  Like Obama Biden thinks that his Center Right corporate policy IS Progressive and everything to his Left is ""how are we gonna pay for it"" and ""The American People aren't there yet man.""  \s\sThe Left very largely voted for Biden this time full-well knowing that he was the second or third most Rightwing candidate in the Democratic field that he valued working with Republicans as his primary m.o. above any preference for policy.  The Left wasn't duped this time or robbed.  It was either frightened and disgusted by Republican fascism enough to not go scorched-Earth against Biden or it's just too small to be able to win a primary against the entire Establishment at this stage.  Either way it has to massively build and probably change quite a few strategies in order to prepare for 2028 when we'll have an even bigger fight over the future of the country and the planet as now and when the AOC's of the world are now serious contenders.>It's funny to me that democrats didn't do shit to fight the supreme court appointment that they just spent months telling us was the apocalyptic horror we had to prevent by voting for a rapey segregationist  \s>  \s>Also the house majority could have stopped a great many things they just spent months telling us were apocalyptic horrors we had to stop by voting for a rapey segregationist but they didn't  \s>  \s>Literally every reply to these tweets: Liberals to poor people on the internet: you sonofabitch this is all your fucking fault you worthless piece of shit fuck you  Liberals to their elected officials: it's ok baby there's nothing you could have done\s\s[https://twitter.com/jediofgallifrey/status/1320882715202359296](https://twitter.com/jediofgallifrey/status/1320882715202359296)Plus Bernie kept telling us that Trump was a very dangerous president and yet Pelosi didn’t even bother to impeach him for his real crimes.

($4.22USD)That is one of the biggest of all propaganda lies. The price of goods is determined by what the market will bear not some magic multiple of their cost. Since McDonalds can obviously make a satisfactory profit in Denmark it should be even more obvious that the wages they pay in the US being only a fraction of the wages in Denmark are purposely set as low as possible only to maximize profits not because they “have to be”.And they never ask if paying a CEO $3000+ an hour will raise the price of a burger.22/hr in Denmark?

No minimum wage and give the bargaining power to the unions. Across the board minimum wage increase does nothing substantial in improving lives.  Unionize.Why do you believe a minimum wage hike to $15/hr does nothing substantial whereas a union negotiating for $15/hr is different? Isn’t the net result the same?

That's the wrong standard and until it changes we're going to see the slaughter by cops continue.\s\sIf a non-violent suspect is running away cops should not be allowed to draw their guns or even use tasers.  They should have to chase and tackle the suspect to subdue them.  Keep in mind the expression ""innocent until proven guilty"".\s\sCurrent policing is not only racist it's classist as well.\s\sImagine some corporate executive selling dangerous products or cheating on his tax returns and having a cop break into his office with his weapon drawn.  Imagine a cop shooting a white-collar criminal.  I wonder why that never happens.  Never ever.\s\sCops are bullies.  They are people who seek power over others.  They dare you and double dare you to give them an excuse to escalate the situation and they feel so righteous and justified because they hide behind their badges.  Bystander videos and body-worn cameras are showing us the abuse that has been going on for decades.  We're shocked by the daily incidents we're seeing but they are nothing new.\s\sWe're getting lots of coverage about this even in the corporate media.  It's not enough.  The focus is still ""this bad cop or that one.""  What's needed is systemic change to policing.  What's needed is a much more clearly defined standard for when force is appropriate.\s\sThe bottom line is that using a weapon should only be permitted when there is an imminent life-threatening threat to the officer or to the public.  Anything else is police abuse and a violation of a suspect's civil liberties.  Again evading arrest by running away or driving away is not justification for the use of a gun.\s\sThe sooner we demand this as the national standard for the use of force by police the sooner we'll see a reduction in the daily carnage.And people are criticizing an actual child for not “complying correctly”. “He should have verbalized he was throwing the gun etc”. He was a child in fear for his life and the fact that people are analyzing his actions instead of the police officer’s is just disgusting. Apparently only cops panicking and reacting poorly is justified. Give me a fucking break.It was a report from Shootspotter not a report of people being shot at. The cop does a fast waist patdown first on the adult then chases after the other ""suspected armed suspect"" down a dark alley with no cover?\sWas this the only cop on-duty?  No backup to call?  Did he have a hero complex?  \sHe put himself into a no turning back situation and forced himself to make a split-second decision in darkness.  \sA guy named Custer sought his own glory and forced his own poor hand in a no turning back situation.Put simply:\s\sThat's a truth close to poetry.When public policing collapses it is up to the people to police \s\sMeaning we should just shoot ourselves instead of waiting for the cops to do it\s\sJk\s\sForm your own community police[It’s wild out there. ](https://youtu.be/4in8yihefEU)This country can either do some very heavy police reform or expect a very high price from failing to do so.

Hard pass.I think our chances of helping that guy are much higher if we don’t call it “socialism”And yet it is socialism. It's in use all over the world including in the US.\s\sThe only issue with the word 'socialism' is american education. And there are a *lot* of issues that come from american education or lack thereof. Maybe you'd be able to help a lot more people by fixing *that* instead of giving in to the self-censoring game that those assholes want you to waste your time playing.[well you ain't done nothing if you ain't been called a red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Tk9QxvZHo)Change the term and they'll demonize that as well.The problem is thinking taxes will help and not be used to fund pet projects. Taxation isn’t the answer especially with a corrupt government.I think I'd go with the meme.\s\sI believe the argument in opposition boils down to:  The sun hangs in the sky therefore all governance should disproportionately represent the interests of a small number of rich people instead of the interests of poorer people.It isn't the *sole* answer. The corruption issue needs to be fixed obviously but *then* properly taxing the rich and getting back the money they stole from workers is still needed.\s\sYou can't redistribute wealth if you don't take it from where it's been hoarded for all this time. So either taxes or just taking it from their bank accounts I'm at peace with both options.Taxes will help at least as much as insurance :)Billionaires will never be taxed the way you think they should they can hide money too many ways. Changes in taxes will always effect the middle class disproportionately. The question is if they can create money at will why tax anyone at all?There is a lot of room between a healthy group of public programs and government controlling the means of production. \s\sI'd be happy if legislators and executives would permanently extract their fingers from the wallets of the wealthy and keep elections honest.welfare liberalism |=| ""socialism""\s\s""socialism"" is not when gov't does stuff nor ""taxes the rich"" either.That’d be the dayDemocrats most definitely don’t want to stop Manchin Cinnamon or any of the centrist Dems. They take cover in being “blocked” by R majorities. And during the brief interregnums where they don’t have an R majority to block them in their posturing by necessity they must elevate one or two “centrist” Dems to prevent any progress from accidentally being achieved (I am sure they have a deep bench of centrists that would be happy to take on this role). Just the way it is in our system where both parties are owned and operated by the same 20 or 30 plutocrats.Exaxtly. This is part of the core rot that needs to be excised.For the life of me I'll never understand why every just shrugged their shoulders when the DNC rigged the nomination for Hillary and stole it from Bernie.I can understand that part it was confusing and no one was really sure what had actually happen d it's not until the DNC was sued that we got clear evidence that proves it could have been rigged as the DNC argued ""we don't have to hold fair primaries we can nominate whoever we want."" Says it all right there the whole system is broken.The corporate media cut coverage of Bernie off and most voters didn't understand what was happening and the DNC wanted the money Hillary would dispense.  It is largely about power and money and politics attracts those for whom money and power are the sole motivators.That was a conspiracy theory spread online by Russian bots Bernie Bros and nazi Trump supporters.\s\s\sEdit: I can't believe I need to edit in a /sDemocrats want what Joe Manchin wants. They just don't want us to know it.Kinda bold to assume that Democrats want to stop Joe Manchin.Joe Manchin is just doing what Joe Biden really wants.  But the same might be said of Bernie of late.Downvote farmer incoming...\s\sDo people honestly believe Bernie could have achieved more? Does anyone believe Manchin would be more liberal and open to things like killing the filibuster if it were Bernie instead of Biden? Odds are it would have been even harder to get anything done.\s\sThats why this whole focus on Biden/Bernie was always wrong if you want to get stuff done.\s\sManchin is not the problem. He is from freaking West Virginia. Thats Trump country. Odds are no other Dem or leftist would even get 30% there let alone have a chance of winning.\s\sThe huge problem is that Susan freaking Collins won Maine again. Biden vs Bernie or leftist vs establishment is so stupid to me if you are left-leaning in the US.\s\sIf you won't ever get 50+ reliable votes in the Senate you are screwed. Thats what people need to understand. Because then you can either kill of the filibuster or use killing it as a threat to get people to cave. Then you can make DC a state and gain 2 reliable Senators. Maybe even Puerto Rico and shift the balance in the Senate more towards the left (currently its heavily biased towards Rs and thats probably the biggest of all problems that needs to be adressed). If you achieve that leftists can still whine about the establishment Dems.\s\sBut right now they don't even have a real case because the freaking system doesn't even work properly enough to have it become a real issue (again Manchin is behaving like he is because he wants to get re-elected in West freaking Virginia. Nobody would need him if freaking Collins wouldn't have won in Maine for some weird reason AGAIN.)Bernie would've at least forgiven student loans through executive order something that Biden still refuses to do. He also would've signed other executive orders to push for progressive agenda that's completely within his power. \s\sSo yes Bernie could've easily achieved more.Democrats are right wing and LOVE what Manchin is doing.Yes!It's a mistake to assume that Joe Manchin is just one guy. He is only the decoy providing cover for other neoliberals so they don't have to face the heat. Why spoil legislation with 10 nays when 1 will do? Half the party agrees with him that if you improve the lives of Americans too much they won't keep voting Democrat out of desperation. Cut one Manchin off another will rise up (e.g. Sinema). We need a more widespread progressive takeover of the party.Joe Manchin is the only one standing up to mob rule at this point. \s\sThe filibuster is a fairly essential part of the federalist system. But democrats just want to steamroll their opposition which is not very cash money.Giving Democrats any credibility is self defeating.  Dismantle the Democratic Party.Dismantle both corrupt parties. Fuck just abolish government at this point it's demonstrated that we cannot trust people in political power they abuse it for self gain.> Democrats may want to stop Joe Manchin\s\sWhy?  Did Joe Manchin do something bad or wrong?Depends who you ask.I would assume at this point that the dems actually love Joe Manchin. They can use him as their scapegoat.Joe Manchin is one of the only people stopping the abolition of the filibuster lmao. Based DemocratRight? If it weren't for that heroic man Democrats would have to out themselves as being yet another party against the people.Fuck Joe Manchin burn in hell scumAnother Dem would step up and replace him.\s\sHe's the Democratic villain of the day. There are many more like him.I have zero love for Manchin however apparently he's very left of center compared to his constituents in WV.Why would they?\s\sManchin toes the line for them all the time.Exactly Manchin is running interference for the party apparatus.Bingo.That implies they actually want to stop Manchin.\s\sLet's get this straight: Democrats love and support Sinema and Manchin because they are playing the role of the rotating villains beautifully.Baked into this is a fallacy that needs to be destroyed in the hearts and minds of people.  Democrats don’t want to succeed their number one priorities are to fail with plausible deniability drum up campaign funds with next time promises or republican fears and work across isle on pro corporate bills.    \s  \sManchin is the best thing to happen to them.It's professional wrestling and Manchin is just the heel. People need to realize that there's really only one party in this country.I can't believe people still don't see thisWell besides Lieberman Baucus Nelson who played Manchin during Obama and Clinton. Then they lose the midterms on purpose because they failed to help again and then they help republicans pass their bills. Pelosi even gave Trump more power to spy on us. lol he spied on democrats! That’s funny.If Democrats wanted to stop Joe Manchin they could easily do so by withholding party funds and campaigning against him. They don't do that.\s\sThis should tell you that the Democrats are perfectly happy with what Joe Manchin is doing.yup Schumer keeps appointing him to committeesHow would withholding funds hurt Manchin if he's not running for reelection? Schumer had to beg him to run in 2018.And if people actually stopped drinking lattes they'd freak the fuck out. How many people self-medicate with sugar and caffeine to help them ignore the meaninglessness of their day to day lives? Ten million? Twenty million?

Millennials aren’t drinking coffee anymore! How are they getting the energy to make it through their gray meaningless lives?”Why not both? Businesses definitely need to pay a living wage but people should also have basic money management skills.No this is about attempting to blame the individuals for systemic failure by pointing to frivolous spending to avoid talking about the larger issue causing the problem.  If your buying 6-7 coffee cups of coffee a day at 4 dollars a cup.  You got bigger problems than rent.People having basic money management skills is obviously not a bad thing but it's also not an answer to crushing poverty and a base standard of living that is increasingly out of reach.  No individual can buy enough coffees in a year to off-set the fact they will never afford a downpayment on a house or a $10000 emergency room trip.  People are annoyed at being told to be wiser with their money because the problem is they have nothing like enough money and their indulgences are relatively petty.But I don't want to give up my full body latte's.$3 latte for 52x 5x = $780.00.

(Short-term capital gains have been taxed at the same rate as ordinary income for this entire period.)[16] This approach was dropped by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 starting with tax year 2018.[2]\s\s\s\s\shttps://taxfoundation.org/biden-capital-gains-tax-rates/\s\s\sTop Combined Capital Gains Tax Rates Would Average 48 Percent Under Biden’s Tax Plan\sApril 23 2021\s\sPresident Joe Biden’s American Family Plan will likely include a large increase in the top federal tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends from 23.8 percent today to 39.6 percent for higher earners. When including the net investment income tax the top federal rate on capital gains would be 43.4 percent. Rates would be even higher in many U.S. states due to state and local capital gains taxes leading to a combined average rate of 48 percent compared to about 29 percent under current law.Good because most of the income for the ultra rich is capital gains. This is an excellent way to tax billionaires.**[Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States)** \s \s >In the United States of America individuals and corporations pay U.S. federal income tax on the net total of all their capital gains. The tax rate depends on both the investor's tax bracket and the amount of time the investment was held. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the investor's ordinary income tax rate and are defined as investments held for a year or less before being sold. Long-term capital gains on dispositions of assets held for more than one year are taxed at a lower rate.\s \s^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | Credit: kittens_from_space)Fuck Biden.

By the time the hangman's noose went taut it's too late to do anything about it.   The oligarchy offers easy credit to Americans then smash their wages into the dirt to force them to take on horrendous medical student car housing poor decision debt.  As a result 80% of Americans are over leveraged to the tits just to bridge themselves from debt to debts.  The majority of Americans are involuntarily and voluntarily perpetuating their own misery.  If we want a general strike we must buy and retire as much of Americans debts particularly medical debts.Without some multi-bilionaire suddenly switching sides  (and believe me they won't) this will never happen.

Yeah about the last thing on earth I'm in the mood to hear right now.The climate crisis reveals that no politician has ever listened to scientists when the narrative does not support their ends.

You say a business owner should profit from their product/service. No one is arguing against a business owner/ceo/corporation profiting from the service/product they offer especially if it's popular - what IS being argued is that our system allowing so much money to find its way to so few people is a symptom of a broken system. \s\sThe problem ISN'T that a lot of money is going to business owners - the problem IS that it's NOT going to:  \sa. its employees  \sb. taxes that fund the system that corporation is using to provide its service/product like how they use public roads and employ people educated in public schools. \s\sAs one example that Amazon went for so many years without paying ANY taxes is obscene and a symptom of a broken system. And the Bernie/AOC-ers are proposing reforms to the systems that allow this much money to ever make it to these owners but not the people/systems that make those things possible.That would be okay if they paid their share of taxes but they do not>if what your producing selling or creating is worth all the money in the world then you deserve it.\s\sI'm trying to think of what could be so important that the person who produces and sells it deserves to have 100% of the world's riches (in which case everyone else has 0%).\s\s🤔 I'm not coming up with anything.

Its like the 1% will allow you to say all the progressive shit you guys wantso long as nothing of value is done about it.Both are controlled oppositionsAOC always had ""nice words"". For example check out [her first interview with Jimmy Dore from about a year before she won her election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl5mpr7hUwc) and the establishment co-opted her.

Money can buy excellent PR.\s\sBillionaires are literally a threat to life on the planet.Gates is not a eugenicist. The reason the world's poorest people have so many kids is simply because of the sky-high infant mortality rate.

Both says = kerching!“Liberal democracies” stage eternal duels and offer voting as a pacifying ritual every four years or so: Democrats vs. Republicans Liberals vs. Conservatives Labour vs. Tories etc. Every election is the most important election. Figureheads and partisan pundits are always “tearing each other apart” publicly in elaborate and spectacular kayfabe full of scandalous barbs that make their way to the front pages. And then in the evening those same rivals go on have drinks together send their kids to the same private schools and “put aside their differences” for important transcendental matters such as war (for) and the environment (against). [[10](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/01/the-curse-of-bipartisanship)]\s\sThe result of this grim state of affairs is that the oppressed classes understandably become deeply cynical about the entire notion of “politics.” Or to put it in terms of political tendency regardless of who they vote for at the booth they begin to become dyed-in-the-wool *Libertarians*; “incompetence of government” becomes their main transcendental political truth. This becomes especially apparent when they discuss the choking and overthrow of the government of *other* peoples in Venezuela and Syria and Korea. Normally disillusionment with one’s government would lead to demands for *better* government or *different* government but Westerners are so ingrained with the idea that theirs is the *best* government that instead they reject the very idea of good governance altogether. And so the masses learn to passively embrace the encroachment of private corporations over all aspects of the economy and indeed life in general. \s\sThe concept of *brainwashing* was invented— by a CIA agent posing as a journalist— precisely because Westerners needed a way to reflexively dismiss the phenomenon whereby their own troops were being persuaded of communist ideas during communist captivity:\s\s>The idea of “brain-washing” can be credited to Edward Hunter a CIA-funded writer and editor who in 1950 started writing articles and books on the subject. His thesis was that Red China and the Soviet Union could control the minds of their respective citizenry— which explained how susceptible Americans captured on foreign soil would be. [[11](https://daily.jstor.org/brainwashing-history/)]\s\sThis new category supposedly qualitatively different from normal ideology acquisition itself turns out to be simply an ideological distinction without a difference.\s\sEvo Morales a man accused of “dictatorship” for repeatedly winning popular elections summarized it well in 2019 after his party was temporarily ousted from power in a US-backed coup:\s\s>As far as I can tell American democracy deceives its people into voting but neither the government nor the people actually govern. It’s the transnational corporations who govern. [[12](https://mobile.twitter.com/theintercept/status/1206308962234224646)]\s\sV. I. Lenin agrees in 1912:\s\s>Since the emancipation of the Negroes the distinction between the two parties has been diminishing. The fight between these two parties has been mainly over the height of customs duties. Their fight *has not had* any *serious* importance for the mass of the people. The people have been deceived and diverted from their vital interests by means of spectacular and meaningless *duels* between the two bourgeois parties. [[13](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1912/nov/09.htm)]\s\sAlso in agreement from the opposite side of class struggle is Grover Norquist a powerful Bush-era republican known for his “Americans for Tax Reform” project in 2001:\s\s>I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub. [[14](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1123439)]\s\sThough he is a sworn reactionary Norquist rejects the notion of abolishment. He simply wants to ensure that elections have no ability whatsoever to impose any restrictions on his bourgeois dictatorship. German Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble advocate of austerity policy in Europe was less crass yet no less succint in 2015:\s\s>Elections cannot be allowed to change economic policy. [[15](https://redsails.org/brainwashing/#fn:Sch%C3%A4uble)]\s\sShielding capitalist interests from “tyrannical majorities” has always been a core value of liberalism finding full apogee in the bourgeois revolutions in France and America. [[16](https://redsails.org/brainwashing/#fn:Losurdo)] The only exception to this overt expression of power occurred partly during the post-war international class struggle known as the “Cold War.” The rise of the Soviet Union led to some tactical concessions on part of the Western bourgeoisie which infused the working classes with illusions about the welfare state which made them particularly vulnerable to endless propaganda denigrating all socialist revolutions as “degenerated” or “authoritarian.” The fall of the Soviet Union naturally led to the clawback of those original welfarist concessions. By this time however having absorbed all of that propaganda so unquestioningly Western workers simply couldn’t entertain the idea of socialist statehood (with all of its trade-offs and complexities) which inevitably led to total historical nihilism and a complete inability to organize towards socialism.\s\sIt’s clear that the main targets of US propaganda are its workers and those of its vassal states all of whom continue to wallow in the darkness of despair the light at the end of the tunnel fully blotted out. Therefore undoing this *brainwashing* is a principal task of the revolution.\s\s---\s\sadapted from https://redsails.org/brainwashing/did you post this up as its' own post?\s\sbecause it needs discussion.\s\si mean yes...it is pretty obvious that if they can't get you to join them in the superbowl political arena to pick a side they'd rather you cynic out and let them do what they were doing anyway--pretending to drown the ""gov't"" in a bathtub while using it as an instrument of oppression against us.\s\sbut what aside from full on mass general strikes and revolution neither of which anyone wants to even countenance much less try to arrange is the solution?\s\sit's a quandary i've been in for some time now.You should not waste your time typing that long responses.

Expecting millions of people living in vast slums with a considerable organized crime element to conform to american ideals is arrogant stupid and unrealistic and borne of pride poor education and lack of understanding of the rest of the planet.Correct the US makes up for 15% of carbon emissions we need to figure out how to pull it out of the air at a resonable cost otherwise we’re just wasting our time.What if we bought the man an electric bike?If customers start to put their money in companies that help save the planet instead of just making a profit it will work.If those companies are more expensive then that is also not going to work as many people are just struggling to get by and can't afford to pay more.That is some Victim blaming if ever id heard itThe neoliberal solution is to co-opt the climate change movement to lobby for solutions that aren't harming capitalism on the contrary it's benefitting it while pretending to be noble and ""activist"" because they're not denying climate change.\s\sThe Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement were a sham what we need is to tackle overpopulation and consumerism but this will never happen because capitalism is based on growth including population one it can literally not exist without growth. So the human race will continue to be delusional and irresponsible until overpopulation will be ""tackled"" on its own through death famine and destruction. The rich fucks don't care though they're already buying New Zealand.They are working on the ""overpopulation"" part as we speak. It's quite terrifyingBased and insightpilledOverpopulation isn’t so much a problem it’s more about distribution of resources>U.S. climate envoy John Kerry on Tuesday said he believed the private sector was more likely to find solutions to climate change than government.\s\s>“I was convinced and I remain convinced no government is going to solve this problem” Kerry said in remarks at the Institute of International Finance’s 2021 Washington Policy Summit.\s\shttps://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/545125-kerry-no-government-is-going-to-solve-climate-change\s\sUh yeah real genius Kerry just like the MIC is going to end the endless wars.\s\sWhat a dumb fucker.That's why people like Kerry need to get the fuck out of public ""service"" so they can at long last be replaced.The private sector responding to capitalism is the reason that coal plants are shutting down all over the US--the total capacity from coal has been halved in the last decade.\s\sI'm not saying that the government shouldn't make certain moves to reduce carbon emissions because it absolutely should.  But to pretend that the private sector hasn't already responded to outside forces to reduce its independence on coal as one example is ignoring the reality on the ground.You don’t get it and your point about the MIC proves Kerry is correct the MIC is a business and their incentivizes are money in order to make money they need to produce state of the art planes/bombs/guns etc what would happen to their government contracts if they were unable to deliver the goods? They’d be given to someone else. If the governement was to offer say a nuclear power plant company with a government contract to build the latest carbon free nuclear power plant they would also need to deliver on the goods. \s\sAnd yes the MIC needs wars to survive but the energy sector doesn’t need climate change all they need are houses and businesses that need power because thats where the money is. \s\sThinking governments are able to solve these problems   when we all know politians only care about clout and lining their own pockets.They could figure out how to endlessly profit off the destruction of the planet but couldn't find a way to profit off saving it and thus themselves. Ironic.It wasn’t always a contest. \s\sGovernment and companies are supposed to complement and grow *together*. That’s how it was pre-1964.It always was profitable for governments but only in the long run.USA consumers consume  more stuff than Europe and china combine to fight climate change they need do something about this.As of the present the neo-lib establishment is the driving political force behind the 'fight climate change' agenda.And the ""fight climate change"" agenda they're pushing is ""do essentially nothing and hope it becomes profitable to fight climate change""Except for the part where they're all bought out by big oil and they're giving huge subsidies to fossil fuel companies.This is wrong in so many ways. Neoliberals aren't hoping sustainable energy sources will be profitable because they already *are* more profitable than fossil fuels. What they're doing is 'hoping' companies will invest in renewable energy and move away from fossil fuels.\s\sThe problem is that the market strategy is too slow because fossil fuel companies don't have incentive to transition to sustainable energy as quickly as they need to if they're guaranteed to have the largest share in the sustainable energy sector once they do anyway. From a business perspective it just makes more sense to sell both instead of one or the other.Isn't the definition of Neoliberal mean RepublicanThe worst part is they don’t even hope they literally don’t care and tell us to hopeThat’s not true the neoliberal solution is a carbon tax.\s\sIf you raise it high enough there won’t be enough money in the world to pay for harmful levels of emissions rendering all unsustainable businesses bankrupt>rendering all unsustainable businesses bankrupt\s\sbut there's that special word that's used as a wild card called ......""BAILOUT""Yup but the government should be funding/subsidizing nuclear and green energy in areas where coal plants are situated as well that way when a carbon tax is applied peoples power bills won’t go through the roof.Agreed.carbon taxes like most taxes fall on US.\s\sso we are going in hock for them.\s\swe need actual set limits and genuine strategies for reaching them not ""invisible hands"" of the market.sorry but it will work.\s\swhy?  follow what just happened with the Covid ""vaccines"" to find out.\s\sthey have been working THAT plan for 20+ years.  they already know how they're going to make money off of it.  the problem as in most things is making us at least compliant if not outright begging Elon to make all of us slaves so he can ""save"" us with ""his"" solar/cars/satellites.\s\sthe question remains whether this will actually do anything for the environment or not but we will all believe it will much like we believe suddenly that kids aren't in cages or that ""racism is over"" or whatever BidenTime has been put in there to sell us.\s\s((btw Elon is a cover story.  much like HOward Hughes was back in the day))The habitability of Earth for humans is a lost cause at this point.\s\sAs we die out at least the neoliberals can state around blankly and say who knew this would happen?\s\sWe fucking knew and Bernie would have been a real attempt at fighting that battle.\s\sBut at least the kids are still in cages...I can't fathom why there is a need for signs like this but I'm guessing it's something an American would get. What the sign is suggesting is pretty damn common here anytime a homeless tent is set up people can always be seen dropping off warm drinks food blankets etc. What the hell are y'all doing to your homeless peeps?I don’t know where you are from but in the US there are now so many homeless people that it’s not one or a few tents.There are so many that they've become 'tent cities' on every available public space. In Chicago (very harsh winters!! ) there is a large tent city on the public land adjacent to a freeway ( expressway ) and also underneath the expressways themselves because the overpasses and bridges provides some protection from rain and snow. The problem is endemic.\s \sWe are the “wealthiest nation” on earth!! Yippee! Yes homelessness in the “wealthiest nation on earth” which spends more on it’s war machine than the next 16 nations *combined*! The “wealthiest nation” on earth has infinite money for it's warmongering but never enough money to assist it’s own citizenry. We the “wealthiest nation” on earth are much too busy making citizens of other nations homeless to help our own. ""American exceptionalism” at it’s finest.So a wealth tax would be taxing unrealized gains now?that wasn't even a good tryThis tweet isn't for people that understand how stocks work.Hey folks stop ordering crap from amazon.  Pass it on.I'm waaaaay ahead of you there : )And... not only would THEY then get massively capital gains or income taxed and half of that vanishes into govt coffers immediately-\s\sBut the jobs disappear permanently!\s\sYep because you forced liquidation of the primary nestegg/asset of the corporation itself not just Bezos when wealth taxation is on the market value of all stock issued not at it's personal sale.\s\sDid I mention the stock price will crash too- so most peeps would actually realize less than 10% of that 100k in the fallout?\s\sOh and that it would probably destroy numerous retirement funds in the WS chaos? So moving in with older family won't save these suddenly unemployed Amazon workers either...1. They get taxed about 30% and everyone would receive 70k that's a lot of money\s1a) Tax doesn't vanish.  Taxes are used to fund public services especially at the local level.\s\s2. Amazon employees work to fulfill various roles at Amazon related to operations.  This does not change when stocks are traded on the open market.  Stock value does not affect the operations or the income of the company. It's the other way around.\s\s3. The tweet clearly states Bezos not Amazon issuing new stock.  If it was new shares it would devalue the current shares by 5% to keep the same valuation.\s\s4. Bezos also has assets not associated with Amazon.  The tweet does not specify where the cash comes from. Private owners selling 5% of the company to other private owners doesn't affect much anyway.  Remember that anytime someone is selling another person is buying.  It doesn't just disappear.\s\s5. There won't be any WS chaos.  Large transactions are made all the time on Wall Street. Travis Kalanick sold his entire 5% stock share in December of last year.  It didn't crash the stock in fact Uber went up in December.  Neither would Bezos selling 5%.  Jeff Bezos is selling all of his stock anyway.  He regularly sells 1000000 shares at a time.  He did so again in August. The stock went up anyway.  Your fears are unfounded.\s\sPS: If you're still worried about it then read the tweet again. He's not actually advocating for Bezos to sell his shares and pay his employees.  He's advocating for a wealth tax. He's advocating for a more egalitarian society.  Do you know who would benefit from that?  You would.*pops Raytheon made camo party-popper that sadly farts out a poof of camo confetti*\s\sYaaaaay! $18000 well spent.Better than having trump though right guys?!Yes it still is. Trump is and would be as corrupt as any politician in office. We’d have an infrastructure package that is full of corporate giveaways like selling valuable assets to pay for it and I’m sure it would include the same or bigger tax cuts for the wealthy except in this case his supporters would blinding support it and dismiss anyone that doesn’t like it as antifa.Yes yes it is.

I don't know who's side she's on.Did she not buck Pelosi's status quo when she fought her on the stimulus bill? I don't know why she hasn't endorsed Shahid (is she the only one who hasn't?) but I don't assume she has any love for Pelosi not after the comments Pelosi has made towards her the squad and the progressive left.Reminder: https://www.nationalreview.com/news/it-was-like-pulling-teeth-aoc-backed-away-from-sanders-campaign-after-joe-rogan-endorsement/ \s\s-=-FAKE PROGRESSIVE-=-It's not even ""capitalist healthcare"" it's health insurance as a concept.  The whole concept of insurance is that an insurance company is betting that most of their customers won't use it all the time.. like car insurance.  Health insurance just can't work if everyone needs to go see a doctor.  Back when people only saw doctors when something serious was going on or twice a year checkups and only really sick people got prescriptions.. health insurance was feasible.  If we want everyone to be healthy and have all of the ailments looked at by experts we need a new system.Yes. It gets worse though; people having insurance allow hospitals to charge more than most people would be willing to pay without insurance. So now if you don't have it you pay ridiculous prices almost nobody can afford. Applies to medications too. \s\s\sIt takes a supply vs demand curve used to set prices and completely jacks it up in this way. Insurance companies are great with it because it makes them necessary while they also have an excuse to charge more.And scumbag Biden is overtly against Medicare for All yet AOC endorses him.\s\sAOC is fake.Bernie endorsed him too even though Bernie obviously supports Medicare for All while Biden doesn't. I'm voting green anyway because fuck Biden and the DNC but if you're calling AOC fake for her endorsement than Bernie is too.So did Cornell west.. you mean to tell me he's fake to?Not saying Biden will make things better. I agree a Biden type isn’t in anyway inspirational\s\sMy fear is that Trump will make tho he worseWhy give consent to either? Pull lever A thousands continue to die but (supposedly) ""it doesn't get worse."" Pull lever B thousands keep dying and (supposedly) ""it will get worse."" How do you justify doing either as a moral person? Is there a policy limit or death count before you'll reject the choice as inhumane nonrepresentative and sociopathic?  \s\sThe 1% duopoly is holding us hostage. Vote Green wake your friends and organize mass protests. Anything else at this point is culpability.""Moderates"" (they're neo-conservatives at this point let's face it) are all about being ""inclusive"" as was the argument Pete Buttibot made for his billionaire wine donors while shouting down Bernie in the debates.\s\sDems never were for the people just for profits. Never Biden Harris Butti or any of their ilk.I can see how people can call her radical or can disagree with what she says. \s\sBut I have yet to come across one single argument against this rhetoric that makes ANY sense. Like? ""BUT THEY NEED 18 NUMBERS IN THEIR ACCOUNT. IT FEEDS THEM. IT GIVES THEM ENERGY."" ?? Like. I really don't get how anybody could be against reducing the copious amounts of money healthcare providers make in America.Then AOC should have actually campaigned for Bernie instead of going into the shadows when it mattered most.I don't think that's fair at all. She literally endorsed him right after he had a heart attack. If that wasn't solidarity when Sanders needed it then I don't know what is.>AOC: Over 100000 Americans are dead and Congress won’t extend Medicare to the unemployed bc it’s too busy protecting a corporate system that makes pandemics insanely profitable for Wall St. ANd I refused to support senator BERNIE R. SANDERS BECAUSE A PODCAST HOST ENDORSED HIM!!!! \s\s#\#FUCK A O C !!And yet when you bring this issue up and mention the fact that Biden steadfastly refuses to support medicare for all you get accused of being a Trump supporter. The Democrats consistently fight against real healthcare reform then offer up what is essentially the moderate Republican approach to healthcare namely a mandate to buy insurance.Biden is horrible. But Trump is worse. What are the real choices? To me its getting Biden in and then supporting down ballot progressives in their primaries. I think the time. To bash Biden is immediately after the election. Then we go hard. I think we need to get rid of the worst thing first.This should have being in the first bill but like always dem play good cop bad cop give republicans everything in the first bill then later help the working class why would republicans do anything if they got 100% what they wanted in the first bill Obama played same game when he was in office to this day people still thing he was progressiveGreat message.\s\sNow bigoted SJW wokescolding and/or unforced praise and support for an establishment shitbag in 4 3 2...And this is why the Democratic Party spends so much money AGAINST Progressive candidates.It should also be pointed out that this is what people can expect from any effort at privatization which is being pushed hard by 'rump & pals. Privatization results in a loss of accountability transparency and control.[deleted]>she is not perfect but wonderful in many ways\s\sShe isn't wonderful in any meaningful way. All hat no cattle.So let's do something about this? Are we done crying online yet? Let's take these fuckers down.This woman literally supports the book ""White Fragility"" lol.   And why should only the unemployed get Medicare?  She's changing her terms because she backs the far-right rapist Biden.this comment is the definition of ""bad faith""The People: ""We need M4A!!""\s\sDems and corporations: ""Wear a mask.""\s\sThe People: ""Okay.""Medicare for All won’t save you from coronavirus.  You get put on a vent you will still have the same chance of dying whether you get off it with a $1 million hospital bill or not.  Wearing a mask however is something you can do to not die.What does she say about the $7 trillion that Pelosi and House Dems like herself gave to the billionaires?\s\sI mean wtf? How can she spew this bullshit but not condemn her own party? AOC is part of the problem. She is seamlessly moving into Bernie's position of marginalized progressive who gets nothing done but whose false outrage camouflages the Dem establishment's right-wingery.So granting that everything the comic says (or implies) about the inequities of capitalism is true what are the options?\s\sOn the one hand I guess you could try to concurrently acquire a supermajority in both houses of congress as well as the presidency composed of true progressives but well... America's system of government was more or less designed to prevent that from happening-- elitism isn't a bug; it's a feature!  And never more so than the era of Citizens United!\s\sWhich leaves... violent revolution I guess?  How will *that* work?\s\sI mean I'm *totally down* for taking most of the DOD budget and fixing all of America's socioeconomic problems but I have no idea how you get there and I don't think voting for Bernie Sanders Howie Hawkins or whoever every four years is going to do it.And probably the only reason many are noticing is because of the the absence of sports.Even though I'm a mild fan of a few sports I've always thought Chomsky was on to something when he critiqued sports as a means of distracting the populace right down to funneling an average person's capacity for deep uncensored analysis into the politics and economics of sports rather than the politics and economics of society. An average dude can call in to a sports talk station and argue intelligently with an authoritative analyst; he can't do the same (outside of CSPAN) with a congressman or the mayor. \s\sPro sports are not just a distraction they're like a safety valve for dissenting thought processes among the lower classes. Like the lottery for the proles in Orwell's *1984*.Opiate of the masses.Mother Fucking Bread and Circus!!!

I finally get ahead of the curve only for the whole game to change.Pay for what?😂😂😂😂😂 no.> 'Self Made' is a myth\s\sIt's not but whatever floats your boat.I don't agree with the Bezos one. It's never been easier to get funding for a good business idea (where like or dislike their current business model there's no denying the initial project was an innovative good idea) even if you're a minority or from a poorer background.Imagine thinking 300k is a lot for an investment after you have an established business.  Imagine just labeling someone the owner of an emerald mine without and value attached. \s\sThese guys are all smart and driven. Plenty of people in this world have much more money when young and produce nothingIn personal finance a very common saying is “Just get to your first million however you can the first million is the hardest” and it’s true. After the first million you have enough money to take risks with still expect growth AND not worry about losing it.there are just enough of the ""self made"" out there to make this sound plausible.  i also believe people are carefully chosen from the underclass to move up to make it seem more possible than it is while reinvigorating the Owning class with fresh blood & new ideas.\s\soften though you find that those people had smarts and quite a few lucky breaks to utilize them within.And this even leaves out how Gates was privileged enough to go to a school where he was allowed to do what he wanted.

I have never heard these people referred to as self made.Obviously growing up being son to an emerald mine owner would’ve made for a comfortable childhood but did Musk’s father ever contribute to financially or otherwise his sons business starts ups (PayPal etc)?

You never have to worry about getting in trouble a wire of cash is never more than a phone call away.   If your parents don't know the right ""elite"" to call to get you into a good school or get a business contract or what have you one of their friends do.  If that friend doesn't they know another guy who does.   \s\s""Networking"" is a manta they teach in business school.  It basically means get in good with someone wealthy or as close to it as you can.  When you're born upperclass you don't have to network you inherit the network.   All you have to do is *not* be a complete prick to those involved and you're golden.  Their networks extend far further than yours do.  3 or 4 degrees of separation for them is the same as your inner circle.\s\sNot everything is about checks with lots of zeros.

This person has an alternative opinion that is actually 100% accurateIf you had insurance it should have been no more than about $15k out of pocket.

Bad faith neoliberals will argue this or that progressive policy isn't popular (when they aren't smearing progressive activists/commentators/journalists) and doesn't have support well perhaps if you were honest with the public about these things it would have more support but it doesn't because you don't because they do NOT want this policy and they will do whatever to control the narrative and uphold the status quo and that includes but not limited to gaslighting and brainwashing.

It is typical of a portion of the population contaminated with such a failed geometry to embrace what they have been told is an acceptable alternative; eco-socialism which is a derivative of the failed British System.

The entire strategy was to keep bernie from being able to speak at the debates.Tulsi took down Kamala and tried to take down Pete and Warren. She defended Bernie when he was accused of sexism by Warren. And rumor is that she might have not endorsed Bernie simply because Bernie's campaign didn't want to be associated with Tulsi.  (I think the rumor was started by Tulsi's brother but Tulsi won't comment on it as it's private.)Say what? Bernie Tulsi Yang and Willianson were shafted in regards to the debate questions and speaking times. Tulsi was kept out of the 3rd debate after calling out Kamala hard during the 2nd. Gravel was kept out of the first debate. It wasn't* just Bernie that was getting screwed and Warren was the only progressive candidate who was propped up and used/manipulated to hurt Bernie. Not that Beto and Booker and Pete and Harris weren't meant to do the same but not progressives. Liberal in name but what does that even mean? Not left as it would suggest but closer to the corporate center.I've heard a lot of criticism of Tulsi Gabbard but this is the first time I've seen her called a stooge for the Dem establishment.

I'm gonna make it RAIN on whoever it is!You could help Texas in the meantime :) \s\sAlmost everyone I knew was going to vote for Bernie including myself I don't know anyone who wanted Biden. Anyway we need Medicare for all and RCV in Texas and I need support to get us there.You want to replace Warren who's far more progressive than biden.\s\sYou people are fucking morons.loooooool you guys STILL think your candidate lost because of foul play? you DO realize thats the same shit as mr orange apeman Trump himself shouting ""stolen election"" just from the left right?You DO realize the DNC argued in court that as a private entity they are allowed to choose who their nominee will be.You DO realize the recent court ruling admitted the DNC fucked Bernie over but it was OK because they never said they wouldn't fuck him over...additionally Warren started that BS about Bernie saying a woman couldn't be president. She's a pos.You do realize we went through this shit in 2016 and the DNC admitted to it right? Then the courts ruled in favor of the oligarchs anyway. Any of this ringing a bell or do you just prefer to chime in without an informed opinion?STFU with your simple minded logic. There's plenty of evidence to prove the coordinated attack on Bernie campaign by establishment. That's exactly opposite of what Trump did. People like Trump have bastardized legitimate criticisms of establishment and now liberal idiots like you can't see the difference between legitimate criticisms and conspiracy theories.“Foul play”. \sUm no. \s\sWhat Warren did was perfectly legal.

Take off the tinfoil\s\sEdit: as someone who has watched Warren’s career for 15+ years and the rhetoric between her and Sanders this is laughable. I campaigned for Bernie but this is laughable. Cry away.\s\s2nd edit: man the toxicity of the hyper left is just as venomous as the far right. The fact that y'all can't see that is incredibly worrisome.Yang admitted Right after he dropped out Biden agreed to offer him a position in his cabinet.\s\sHe bought the nom by promising these idiots positionsIf not true why didn’t she drop out when she had no clear chance of winning and endorse the only other progressive (as she calls herself) in the race? It’s not that ridiculous to think that there was some sort of coordinated everyone drop out and endorse biden plan before Super Tuesday... because that’s what happened. Perhaps she was thinking of her big future appealing to rich white faux progressives as to not actually endorse biden but she sure as hell didn’t do anything to help the progressive agenda or candidate. But ppl were mean to her on the internet 🐍🐍This guy gets it🐍Forever fuck Elizabeth Warren.Maybe she still thought she could win.So your argument is she's stupid.Maybe she is just a phony.That would indicate she's either really stupid or insane🐍 gonna 🐍Yup and Pete stayed in the race to hurt Bernie in exchange for a cabinet position. Legal in the system but deeply undemocraticI'd thought it was Pete dropping out that hurt Bernie more. Despite all that fuckery in Iowa with the app and shadow inc. Pete claimed he won and the media mentioned it enough times until people believed it. So the ""winner"" or at least 2nd place finisher in Iowa dropping out before Super Tuesday seemed sketch.\s\sHe had the funds to at least make it to ST and he'd had more success than Warren. Doesn't really make sense that he drops prior to ST unless a deal is struck with Biden using Obama as a facilitator. Klob also drops despite her home state voting on ST and despite her also having more success than Warren. \s\sPete and Klob drop before ST so the moderate establishment Reagan Democrats coalesce around Joe. Moreover Warren remains despite having less of a chance than Pete or Klob but she splits the ""progressive"" votes while the conservative Dems endorse Biden.It really was bizarre that Warren didn’t endorse Bernie... at ANY point.\s\sHowever to be fair Bernie shares part of that blame for not playing the game and reaching out.  He should have offered her some kind of power share commitmentShe really really was pissed off with his campaign and the amount of supporters questioning her/drawing attention to her faults. She took it as some personal vendetta obviously. She’s always cared about herself more than anything.It is such a blessing that Bernie wasn’t elected President. I wouldn’t wish this presidency on anyone especially not Bernie. Biden got the shaft— sure he gets to be the “star of the show” right now; meanwhile Bernie is free to do what he does best: Work for the American People! He gets to serve as a trusted advisor to the administration making the changes we need; meanwhile if anything goes wrong it’s on Biden. Bernie can peace whenever he wants too. I’m happy for that.Fuck TYT for propping up Warren to their semi progressive liberal base. That plus villifying Bernie's legit allies (Tulsi and Yang) spelled disaster for the progressive movement.So much this.\s\sThere’s a lot to like about Ana Kasparian but every time she went after Yang’s UBI for not supporting people in expensive states/areas (e.g. NYC San Francisco) proportionally as well as cheaper areas (e.g. rural Kansas) I wanted to scream into a pillow.\s\s*IT’S A FEATURE NOT A FLAW. MEANT TO MITIGATE THE BRAIN DRAIN OF MIDDLE AMERICA TO THE BIG CITIES!*I’m sorry but Tulsi has turned out to be anything but an ally. I have never been so disappointed in a candidate in my entire life. Her pandering to Tucker Carlson’s base and his non sense says it all.her role was also to stick the knife in with that misogynist smear. 🐍  🐍  🐍  🐍  🐍I remember seeing prominent progressives that I followed and liked argue that saying this was misogyny as super tuesday was unfolding lolI would think admitting a woman can be just as corrupt and shitty as a man would be considered feminist.I don’t care if they call me a misogynist because no one who is on my side will care about their bullshit name calling. And anyone who does care? Shows me their ass.At the end of the day she’s just a neoliberal.""I'm a capitalist to my bones"" is all anyone should have needed to hear from her.\s\sbut the idpol libs loved her -- and she helped me understand how misogynistic I am for caring that everybody gets healthcare more than wanting a woman president.I’ll never not be salty about this.A year ago:\s\shttps://twitter.com/scottheins/status/1356954042363166720They have been fucking Bernie over for years.  They'll do it to AOC next.She did it to Bernie too! Don't you remember when she headlined a rally in Iowa and she failed to mention Bernie Sanders at all. And for AOC getting the Bernie treatment lately she's doing it to herself.They already are. They have convinced AOC that to get the ""policies"" done you have to get the ""power"" first. Now she's playing buddy-buddy with her ideological nemesis Nancy Pelosi. That's how they start and get the newcomers stuck in a rat race of gaining and maintaining power while forgetting about policies.Don't bet on that one.Good. We don’t need a hyperpartisan progressive Executive. Change my view.Warren's assigned role on ST was to lose by more than she was projected to. the same as was Bloomberg's role. That's what gave cover to the sudden inexplicable rise of Biden. That + Amy and Pete withdrawing the weekend before to give the appearance of ""consolidating the center"".\s\sI say that because my analysis showed a clear and present pattern of Bloomberg and Warren each losing about 1/3 to 1/2 of the votes projected in the poll the night before ST. In just about every single state. That while Biden won those votes so lost and Bernie gaining nothing from Warren's ""shifty"" would-be voters. \s\sThe algorithm for vote flipping was likely in place for at least a couple of weeks with the final numbers awaiting that night-before poll. I said before that I believe Bernie himself was likely notified that he ain't gonna be allowed to be the candidate the weekend before ST. When did Warren know what her assigned role was? probably earlier - perhaps just past NH.\s\sNo need to ask about Bloomberg - he was part of the play all along - from the get go. The money he spent was a smokescreen to help buy cover for the DNC. He IS one of the insider power players so he knew what needed to be done and why (make sure Bernie loses more or less credibly). How he gets compensated in due course is not for us to ask because we may never know. mafiosi get rewarded for loyalty - that's all we need to know.\s\sHow will Warren be compensated? that we have yet to find out but snakes be snakes she knows she'll be - in due course.Excellent comment. I’ll add why is it so weird to believe that democrats MIGHT have stolen the election from Trump? They already showed the world that they have no problem rigging their primaries.

Not really sure how to get them to see that right is not the answer to these problems.I always hope that the incoming President will do something good even if I don’t like him and didn’t vote for him.  “Draining the swamp” didn’t seem like a bad idea but Trump went right to the swamp for his administration.I don’t understand how people think this. Yeah Trump made a lot of good points in 2016 during his campaign but obviously he was not going to do what he said. Then he spent 4 years doing the bidding of big corporations while following through on 0 of his drain the swamp promises and all his supporters refused to recognize it.In 2016 one of my close friends told me he would either vote for trump or Bernie.

The GOP and the Republican Party writ large mostly pander to white male evangelicals. The GOP (""the GOP’s congressional representatives in Congress (both House and Senate) are 95 percent white"") and the Republican Party writ large (""Republicans are predominantly white with 87 percent of them identifying as non-Hispanic white"") are both *overwhelmingly* white.I'm glad to hear any and all criticism of Biden's cabinet picks and she brings up some really valid criticism. But I'm sick of all this outrage at other people's outrage or at their perceived approval or whatever it is. Like this seems to be engaging in its own kind of identity politics. Diversity is important. Representation is important. Policies are also important; in fact they're more important but it is not an either/or kind of situation.\s\sJust criticize the people he's picking based on their real faults which are many. What is gained by saying these people are bad but some perceived liberals are applauding them because of diversity? Feels like a different form of ""owning the libs"" which I don't find useful and I start to tune it out.It’s pointing out that fawning coverage that only focuses on diversity is a cover story for the fact that these people suck and only represent the establishment.She lists numerous real examples of why the picks are bad.> Just criticize the people he's picking based on their real faults which are many.\s\sShe does exactly that. Instead of engaging in exactly the disingenuous tactic called out in the video maybe you should actually watch it.This is what I tell everyone in my life. Of course I would be overjoyed if a great politician working for the working class was a minority or LGBT member but I d take the most generic pro working class white guy over the most diverse sell out anytime anywhere.Well then you're racist. And transphobic.As do most brown folks actually.I agree 💯""Buzz your girlfriend woof""Congratulations. You have a brain.That's the truth.  \s\sI'm going to go see if she got clobbered in the comments.\s\sEdit-- no she didn't!  Nice.The checks stopped coming for the shillbot hoards.Liberal identity politics promotes people if they will preserve the hierarchies of class race gender etc.  So if it promotes people of marginalized identities it is very selectively and conditionally and basically contingent upon *opposing* the interests of the marginalized identities they share.\s\sLeftist intersectional identity politics promotes people of marginalized identities *because (and when) they look out for the interests of those marginalized identities they share*.\s\sThose philosophies are almost in direct opposition to one another even on this front of supposed ""social liberalism"".[removed]> Liberal identity politics promotes people if they will preserve the hierarchies of class race gender etc.\s\sNot at all.   The people at the top only care about one hierarchy and that is class.   That is why in the UK a recent equality report that ""poor white boys"" now get the ""worst start in life.""   So white males simultaneously occupy the highest and lowest rungs of society in the UK.   If intersectional theory were remotely accurate then (a) this never would have happened and (b) there would be massive campaigns to help white males.   \s\sSimilarly males literally have less rights than females they suffer discrimination in most major institutions (including the education system and the criminal justice system) but there are no departments in government designed to correct these imbalances; instead all gender departments focus almost exclusively on women and girls.   \s\sSo intersectional theory is just objectively wrong.  \s\sWhy is it so popular?  It's popular because elites promote it.   The majority of rich white males don't give a shit about race or sex except insofar as it can be used as a divide and conquer strategy and the same is true of rich non-white-males.   Intersectionality thus serves the same function as old-school racism/sexism they just switched the scapegoats and slapped a ""progressive"" label on it.    \s\sAdditionally an entire professional class has grown up around these issues.   They earn their living by promoting hatred and discrimination against white males just as certain figures on the right earn their living from promoting hatred and discrimination against Muslims Mexicans etc.   \s\sThe only path forward for the left is to abandon identity politics (at least in most forms and most of its current incarnations) and return to a class-based approach.   This is also the only way of helping the vast majority of what you call ""marginalized identities.""   Universalist solutions rooted in class solidarity lift up all poor and working class people and diminish bigotry.   Intersectionality reduces class solidarity and actually promotes the growth of the far right.it's sad that this even needs to be said.Almost like people should be judged on character not race gender or creed.Identity politics sounds great because in theory you gain more representation of more cultures and ideas.  However more often than not you are left nearly blinded by the fact that because they are a minority they must hold the ideals of the minorities they appear to represent when they in fact are merely a vehicle for the same crap used to oppress the minorities who put their trust in them.So everyone has their 1 share of GME right? Biggest transfer of wealth 'bout to pop off.Of course those who own the communication lines told us that after they ""let"" us talk with eachother!History told meIndeed over time wealth disparities appear and grow some folks are always able to figure out ways to grab more than their share.

Civil war wasn't just about freeing slaves even though that's what history books in public schools teach us.\s\sWhether history is true or not needs to be interpreted by evidence.Yet giving it all to the billionaires is A-OK.Nah.

We need a new plan peopleRedistributing other people's wealth works until you run out of their money.Can you explain how that happens?If America is to survive the Republican party needs to die.> Republican party\s\sParty politics in general needs to die.Only if the deplorable corrupt democrat party is killed as well.All these people pulling their hair out over Trump. What do they think happens when he goes away? We say that MAGA folks have this deluded vision of how America used to be so great and we condemn them for it. But the Blue MAGA does the same thing with the same rose tinted glasses over the Clinton Obama and even the Dubya years. Like Trump is the only problem in our country and once hes gone we ""win.""\s\sTrump is such small fucking potatoes and totally out of his element and in over his head. He cant even keep an administration together without unprecedented amounts of turnover and resignations. Trump is just a symptom of a much larger problem. I'm more afraid of the billionaire class the Chenys the Mitch McConnells the Bushes Clintons et all. Everyone that got our country to fall so far behind the other wealthiest nations in the world.\s\sBut it's all ""Trump Trump Trump."" The Democrats platform is literally ""just beat Trump."" That's the only idea they campaign on. People believe that returning the country to the same climate that led to Trump's rise in the first place is somehow desirable.I’m blaming MSNBC over everything elseBefore Trump was elected: *TRUMP IS GONNA DEPORT/KILL/IMPRISON ALL THE ILLEGAL ALIENS POLICE WILL MURDER BLACKS FREELY THE ECONOMY WILL COLLAPSE AND WE WILL BE IN WW3!*\s\sAfter Trump was elected: *Alright so there were less deportations under Trump than Obama and less police shootings too and ok the economy was at a record high and multiple wars have ended but...

Theres nothing socialist about the American economy thats why its so fucked up.Is this a better analogy instead of the government spending tax dollars on a social safety net for all Americans they use that money to make golden parachutes for their friends and donors.Exactly this! Enough is enough!Why do people keep pu.ing this fake socialiat resistance grifter?Bingo. The idea that Trump caused this rather than simply rose to power and participated in the final stages of its decline *as a result of that decline* is as ahistorical and foolish as thinking that a badly maintained car broke down because of a cheap battery when you haven't changed the oil in ten years. \s\sOur country's problems have been postponed and made worse for decade after decade and what little social stability we had after the 60's was achieved solely by coasting on the limited gains of the New Deal era as the wealthy classes slowly chipped them all away into dust. \s\sIn short it's 1890 again but with computers and Trump is not just a problem but a symptom of a dying empire with internal colonies slums ghettos hollers and bantustans that encompass more of the population every year.I almost want to gild this; excellent post and this is spot on the problems with our politics right now.smoke & mirrors + divide & conquer = TrumpStill voting for BidenNope voting Green!

This is twice (that we know of!) the democrat party has committed election fraud and election rigging.Bro I literally just made this point. Ppl acting like we weren’t already a failure before Trump.*neolibs> Ppl acting like we weren’t already a failure before Trump.\s\sThe top 5% literally cannot accept that!It's a gated community mentality.  They didn't mind people like Trump plundering and stealing from *the poors* as all the craters left behind were all on the outside.  Remember when Democrats and liberals *LOVED* Trump? I do.  \s\sTrump saw how soft they had gotten ignoring the growing chaos outside the gates. In their arrogance it never occurred them that a **corporate pirate** might break the unwritten rule that corporate pirates must always punch down and never punch up.  \s\sNow Trump has been doing muddy 4x4 donuts all over their million dollar ""safe spaces"".  They have become so numb to reality that don't know what to do when *the poors* aren't falling in line to save them from Trump.  They are desperately working to get that MSNBC grand republic fantasy back and go back to ignoring *the poors* sinking into the sludge outside their gated community.This is 1 out of many reasons I hate Biden so much corporate Socialism isn’t capitalism.No but it sure seems like the natural progression from capitalism. Success generates a feedback loop leading to more success and eventually enterprises become so successful they have the power to begin altering law and influencing politics. How could that eventual development from an initial ""untainted"" capitalism be prevented?I find it immensely weird that the great-again America these ppl are screaming for is back when you could support a family with one decent paying job...due in large part to organized labor. Back when education was of high quality and affordable infrastructure was a top priority jobs in science were seen as prestigious not solely for income but for the innovations that benefitted everyone they often produced.\s\sBasically what they and their predecessors have spent the last 40+ years frothing at the mouth to systematically dismantle AND THAT *THEY* FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO DISPARAGE AND DESTROY.\s\sCredit where it's due it's gotta be one of the most successful long cons in history.Most people that end up voting for republicans I don’t think were very politically active to begin with. I just think that the democrat party has totally lost touch with the working class to the point when they hear some politician talking about some hot air means tested bullshit they get confused annoyed and disenfranchised. So the gop panders to them about A. taxes and B. Their patriotism. All the while proposing and passing legislation that screws them over again and again and they have successfully been brainwashed to a point that it’s going to take some serious work to get them to understand what’s actually going on.Government intervention a self-fullfilling profecy\s\sInterviene when there isn't any real problem make things worse and say the solution is that you didn't have enouth government\s\sWhy people still fall for it after what it did to helfcare and education is beyond me> support a family with one decent paying job\s\sYou’re leaving out the part about how women entering the workforce and the fall of the nuclear family doubled the size of the labor market. Also women tend to spend extraordinary amounts of money on education only to work for a few years then retire to childcare today.\s\sThe wages in the 50s weren’t simply good “because of unions.” They were also good because society was efficiently organized around the family and not “women’s freedom.”\s\sEducation was also high quality and affordable because the demand was lower before women commonly started entering university. \s\sAnd infrastructure *is* a top priority for Trump. Have you been living under a rock?\s\shttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-16/trump-team-weighs-1-trillion-for-infrastructure-to-spur-economy\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_policy_of_Donald_Trump#2017-19\s\sSounds like less of a “con job” and more of you just strawmanning people you disagree with.When you say ""support a family"" can you clarify what you're talking about? What was the average home size? How many cars did the family have? How many TVs? What kind of technology? What educational resources were available?\s\sAs for jobs what was the competition like for these great jobs? Was this dream existence available to anyone who wanted it? Even say a black gay man? A Jewish lesbian?\s\sIf you look at how people lived back then most people could raise a family by those standards in many cities in the USA on a single income today. You're not going to have four cars a McMansion and annual family vacations to Disney World but if you want a 1200sqft home one car one TV no technology and low cost education it's doable.Most standard rank-and-file Democratic voters would agree with that take. You could go back 10 years and they’d agree with that take. \s\sThe problem is getting those same voters to realize that it’s not just the Republicans who have caused this; that the Democratic party’s contributions to these problems are not simply due to Republican intransigence but because they largely agree with the overall agenda.Obama’s total failure as a POTUS is not eradicated by zealots constantly attacking his successor.Obama’s only failure was not kicking conservatives lawmakers out when they were willing to cripple the government just to undermine him.Agree with what he said except the “socialism for corporations.” It makes no sense unless you think “socialism is when the government does stuff and the more stuff they do the more socialister it is.”The issue is socializing the costs and privatizing the profits. The taxpayers put so much money toward advancing private industry in this country that it's not even funny and we almost never see a return on investment. All of that money gets siphoned away to the billionaire class while they simultaneously jack up the prices of drugs that we subsidized the research for and manufacture weapons of mass destruction to kill innocent people in other countries.It's not an analogy it's literally policy. Whether we are talking about tax cuts for the rich and big corporations or talking about the auto industry bailout in 2008 or Quantitative Easing (printing money) or the CARES act which is arguably responsible for keeping the stock market near record highs despite 30 million people being unemployed. Refusing to budge on the federal minimum wage which was always meant to provide a living wage. Companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon can get away with paying full time workers below the federal poverty line in income. Those workers then apply for and depend on federal and state aid like Medicaid and SNAP nutritional benefits (food stamps). All of this comes at the cost of the taxpayers the overwhelming majority of which are working class people. Our country subsidizes and socializes labor cost and losses for big corporations. We already live in a socialist society. \s\sIf you collect a paycheck in the United States you are directly subsidizing the low paid workers that get these and other benefits. Meanwhile the Walton family or Jeff Bezos own several billion dollars in wealth. You likely pay a higher tax rate as a percentage of your income than many of the rich do as well. Because of the low tax rates on investment income and trades. As we speak the Fed is printing and pumping millions upon millions of dollars into private equity groups. During the middle of a global pandemic and global recession these private equity groups representing the richest people in the world are soaring in value. \s\sThere are many other policies and aspects these are just a few I've mentioned. But the net result is that in the United States today it's socialism for the rich and big corporations and rugged individualism for everyone else.Yes and no and I say that as a leftist. \s\sThe idea of hypothetical ""corporate socialism"" is instructive because it combats the ridiculous belief that's been beaten into people's heads about how the government can't do anything efficiently etc. The reality is that we live in a kind of inverted socialism- or maybe what would happen if a bunch of elites read Marx's *Kapital* and completely reversed the values set in it. \s\sAbove a certain level of wealth the state serves as a social democratic entity for wealthy people and corporations. It bails them out. It protects them from excessive liability. It protects them from systemic risk. it subsidizes their risks and experiments and makes sure to encourage a nurturing environment for their children their sick and injured etc. It's responsive to the wants and needs of the 1% ers and changes when their beliefs shift as multiple studies on oligarchy in America have shown. \s\sI think it was Sheldon Wollin who said we were essentially living in a system of inverted totalitarianism. I say we're living in a system of inverted social democracy too where those who need the benefits of socialist or socdem policies are denied them and those who don't need them have rich social democratic-type frameworks to cushion the hardships of the market system for themselves.Comments:\s\s>And people's willingness to play along in the Merican dream manifest destiny.\s\s*\s\s>Yes. People need to realize that they deserve more from their governments than they’re getting. We cater too much to those that hold the balance of power. Demand better representation & establish new parties that will improve conditions for the vast majority.\s\s*\s\s>Totally agree as the system was cleverly set up to be contingent on $$$ before you can even qualify for a debate nevermind get elected. Hence a financial democracy where money buys candidates and elections to keep the ""system"" alive under the guise of an actual democracy....\s\s*\s\s>Telling NeoLib Dems their preferred choice is not all that different from the choice they reject really makes them angry. The #DNC stance on social issues cloud the Dem voters minds to the parties complicity in exploitive economic policies.\s\s*\s\s>And it took a grifter of Trump’s incompetence to bring it into the light.\s\s*\s\s>Not to mention a foreign policy that has had American Exceptionalism at its core leading to pain misery and death for millions worldwide.\s\s*\s\s>Correction: Trickle down economics worked EXACTLY as planned. It had 1 very specific goal the destruction of the middle class. They have succeeded in that we are now a majority poor country. Feudalism was the goal with a permanent upper class.>Feudalism was the goal with a permanent upper class.\s\sSome truth in that except it's NEO-Feudalism. The upper class gets all the rights and riches and has none of the responsibilities. (That seems to be at the root of *all* the Neo-isms of these latter days: All for Us and Nothing for You.)He's 100% correct. Trump is a symptom of a larger cancer not the tumor itself. The DNC and people like the Lincoln Project only want to treat the symptoms not the disease. Biden supporters want to use an old bigoted predatory white guy to defeat another old bigoted predatory white guy.> people like the Lincoln Project only want to treat the symptoms\s\sNot really. They just want to be cause of the symptoms not the upstart Trump.>Trump is a symptom of a larger cancer not the tumor itself.\s\sTrue.  I remember hearing a song at a rally along those lines back in 2004.  Don't remember the verses but the chorus was\s\s'Cause the Emperor needs some new clothes  \sAnd the Emperor needs a new home  \sBut we have to be sure when the Emperor goes  \sThat the Emperor won't go alone.\s\sUnfortunately the Emperor did go alone.

I'd say it's always been pretty much trickle down (if that) except for the New Deal(s) and the Great Society.   However I care more about how and when it will end than I do when it started.It's always been trickle up. From the poor to the rich. In the 80s the propaganda just got more sophisticated. It was never trickle down.Gen-X checking in yup yup been watching this freekshow forever. And now the neo-shit-libs act like republicans more and more sigh. Voting 3rd party for progressThey are mask off now. Welcoming and giving platforms to Bush-era neo-cons because ""orange man bad"" while shitting on progressives (again) tells me all I need to know about the Democratic Party. The Overton window has been moved so far to the right and MSNBC reflects that.  My middle-aged punk-rocker dad who gifted me with Chomsky books in my teenaged years and who DESPISED THE BUSHs is now trying to get me to read David Frum and watch Nicole Wallace.  All because he watches MSNBC religiously. He now parrots their arguments against Bernie. So sad :(\s\sVoting 3rd party as well.  He shit a brick and tried to shame me when I told him. How predictable.GenX screen name checks out.If I vote Green Party and trump were to win my state should I then feel partially guilty? Because the obvious choice in my mind is to vote green but it seems like that won’t even make a tiny dent in fixing our completely broken systemIt's true ; wouldn't complete 100% honesty demand that we admit that this current situation is not all Trump's fault?They realize that when talking about the transition from Obama to Bush. Liberals are hypocrites.Absolutely. This sub is right to identify a fetishized image of Trump as the ""root of all failures"" for a chunk of liberals. At the same time say we could somehow quantify Trump's responsibility for the ""current situation"". Say he were responsible for 10% of it - and that replacing him with even a milquetoast Dem would remedy this modest fraction of the issue. Why wouldn't we? Because our efforts to improve beyond this 10% evaporate when we accept this obvious solution to a *portion* of the problem? Then it seems like a lot of the people in this sub have as much to learn about the importance of everything *in between* presidential elections as the liberals you criticize do.""Tricke down"" economics dosen't exist. It's a strawman created by the left to slander suply-side economics by pretending it has something to do with giving money to the rich\s\sAnd it baffles me saying you are a socialist isn't political suicide like saying you are a Nazi is for example.

It's not complicated and has nothing to do with democracy.there has been something of a figurate jackboot on the people's throaths since the dawn of man both from nature and people. Neither the weather nor chief Krodukk are valid examples of fascism. Fascism is not just when anyone acts ""authoritarian"" or subjugates your will it is complicated.What is feudalism then if not a figurative jackboot on people's throat? Coercive societies have existed since the dawn of time. Its really just the degree to how coercive they are.Isnt that what democrats did during 2020 election.

No chance anyone actually running the guantlet of our electoral process is anything but hungry for both and willing to do whatever is needed to get and keep it.Politicians of a political party must follow the policies of that party.

When Congress imposed human rights restrictions—by then there was a human rights movement in Congress—to block the flow of advanced weaponry to Indonesia Carter arranged through Mondale—the Vice President—to get Israel to send U.S. skyhawks to Indonesia to enable Indonesia to complete what turned out to be near genocide killing maybe a quarter of the population or something.\s>\s> In the Middle East—Carter just won the Nobel Prize—his great achievement was the Camp David agreements.  The Camp David agreements are presented as a diplomatic triumph for the United States.  In fact they were a diplomatic *catastrophe*.  At Camp David the United States and Israel accepted finally Egypt's 1971 offer which the U.S. had rejected at the time.  Except that now it was worse from the U.S.-Israeli point of view because it included the Palestinians.  In order to get Israel to accept Egypt's 1971 offer after a major war and atrocities and so on Carter raised military and other aid to Israel to more than 50% of total aid worldwide.  Israel used it at once in exactly the way they said they were going to do and as every sane person knew as an opportunity to attack their northern neighbor first in 1978 then in 1982 and increase integration of the occupied territories.\s>\s> And that's for starters.  We can continue.Everyone look better once they leave evil house aka White House.It just sickens me that were currently living through Ronald Reagan's 11th term.

To say that because Bernie lost in primary therefore he would've lost in general is the most bullshit answer ever given that his strongest supporters were independents who are less likely to vote during primaries compared to DNC loyalists.\s\sMoreover poll after poll showed that the overwhelming reason for DNC primary voters voted Biden was because they were told that he had the best chance at beating Trump because of 'electability' whatever that means. At the same time poll after poll showed that Bernie's policies were extremely popular.

I'm just wondering where I can learn about this info dont downvote me.What the hell are you talking about? Bernie polled very well in matchup polls against Trump. And in terms of his popularity nationally and within his own state he's been the most popular politician in the US several times over the last five years.\s\sIf you get downvoted it's because you're spouting falsehoods as fact.Look at the size of his rallies the long lines of people waiting to hear him speak and compare it to any of the other candidates who ran against him. That's no guarantee they'd all turn out and cast a vote for him but to claim that Biden won when he could hardly fill a high school gymnasium against a man with thousands coming out to his rallies is utter bullshit and just one indicator that something was very rotten in Denmark.Is no one going to bring up the fact that they used COVID as an excuse to not hold primaries?\s\sI registered as a democrat for the first time so I could vote in the primaries and my state delayed ours until like August when everyone had already dropped out.\s\sOur electoral system is an absolute farce and this covid bullshit has fucked up literally everything good in lifeShadow shmaddow or Maddow shmaddow its all ALL\s\sA☆L☆L\s\sOne big hustle.

I assume that's an annual bill but $267B seems like an interesting number if it means ending hunger forever which I can't even comprehend how they'd be confident to ever accomplish.In 2009 a UN study said about $30B.  Adjusted for inflation that would still be under $100B.  But whichever of those orders of magnitude it is it's clearly a worthwhile expenditure unlike the spending that goes toward murdering millions of brown people and further enriching capitalists through weapons manufacturing.If you listen closely you can hear the sound of hands rubbing together in the background of the ""$262B"".\s\sWorld aid has always been a thieving grift.And some pf you complain about Elon Musk 🙄Sadly this has been the case for the last 70 years or so I think they've fleeced us of immense wealth :(Socialism for defense contractors harsh capitalism for the people.Normally I'd agree with you tbh.

COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution misdirection and control of a internet forum\s2. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation\s3. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist\s4. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent)\s5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression\s______________________________________________________________________________________\s \s \sCOINTELPRO Techniques for dilution misdirection and control of a internet forum..\s \sThere are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.'\s \sTechnique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'\s \sIf a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist which can be called upon to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.\s \sTechnique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'\s \sA second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.'\s \sTechnique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'\s \sTopic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.\s \sTechnique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'\s \sInformation collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.\s \sTechnique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING'\s \sStatistically there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.\s \sTechnique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'\s \sIt is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings deleting memberships flooding and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.\s \sCONCLUSION\s \sRemember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.The Gentleperson's Guide To Forum Spies.Good info. I suspect cointelpro technique #6 occurred in /r/antiwork. Any pointers to the other 5 topics you listed?>  To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. **Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers** and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video.\s\sOne or two? lololFYI u/santefe (who has been turtled) just marked my post with a snake emoji award.

The elites have been very successful in doing so. We can have both class and race consciousness. It’s not a zero sum game.Everyone needs to visit this breaking points post to see it in action.

When the capitalist realized the authoritarians in Russia were more interested in stomping on their own people into the ground then conquering  their capitalist assets they turned to dismantle the social democracry FDR built to save the country from capitalist overthrow.  The boomer capitalists accelerated the collapse and overthrew the American Republic one congressional cycle at a time.  At this point our national government has completely collapsed.   What is left is a shallow  facsimile to dismantle and liquidate the American people's remaining assets.  What happens when they have noting left to sell off?From Dean Baker:\s\s>The minimum wage would be $24 today if it kept pace with productivity\shttps://labortribune.com/opinion-u-s-minimum-wage-has-failed-to-keep-up/We workers must stop supporting this system with our work and our consumerism.\s\sGeneral Strikes!\s\sCivil disobedience is the only way.I’ve been general striking since January and WILL NOT return to work for anybody but friends/family.\s\sJust waiting for others to join but I legit would rather suffer and die under poverty than waste my life working in torturous“comfort” just so some soulless cretins can buy a third summer home.Thank you for that nice Processed Farnsworth ref!Yes bring on more inflation. That’s what we all want. More inflation more inflation!!!!The federal minimum wage hasn't increased in over a decade. Prices have sure remained stagnant during that time. /s\s\sDo you even listen to yourself?\s\sTime to pull this out of the dustbin.\s\sLet me play some math for you here. The average national payroll cost on a company is ~25% (includes wages benefits payroll tax workers comp unemployed ins.). It can vary from as little as 15% to as much as 50% (depending on industry) but it averages around 25% nationally. You can look that up. The remaining 75% of cost to an average company is overhead inventory debt etc.\s\sFor simplicity let's say hypothetical small company A (that pays mostly minimum wage) spent $1M in cost last year. At 25% of cost payroll was about $250K. Now let's say you double the minimum wage (ie: approximately double payroll). The company is now spending $500k on payroll and their total expenditures are $1.25M. So even though their payroll doubled their total cost only went up 12.5%. Even if downstream (also minimum wage) sees and passes on the same cost markup that's still at most another 12.5% for a total of 25% cost increase.\s\sSounds like a lot but you have to consider every employee just saw their pay double. They now have twice as much money to spend. So a 12.5% to 25% average increase in cost sees a 100% increase in money to spend. Now multiply that over a whole state or whole country. This is why workers at McDonald's in Norway can be payed $22/hr and yet their BigMacs only cost ~30 cents more than ours (update: now cheaper than ours).\s\sBut I'm sure you'll say 25% of cost is just the average what about those companies where payroll makes up half their total costs. How are they going to survive? The answer is those companies with oversized payrolls tend to be sit down style restaurants. When Seattle raised it's minimum wage to $15 there was a huge outcry that the restaurant's would be run out of business and dry up because of it. Fast forward a few years later under the $15 minimum wage and Seattle's restaurant scene was doing as well as it ever had (at least until covid hit).He's leaving out a million factors one being china's own influence on our labour markets.\sPretty big one honestly.It was never the billionaires or corporations it’s the federal reserve and it will continue happening if people don’t figure that fact out.Does anyone want to explain how fiat currency is to blame? Along with the government printing of money? I mean we all are feeling the effects of trump printing trillions for covid and it aint going to get any better oncd biden is done with the money printer. They have been pretty heavily devalueing the currency for year's and it's been a major problem since we switched to fiat completely under nixion. Money printer going burrr is very bad for your quality of life and is a major issue. The blame is being placed in the wrong place. \s\sIt's basic supply and demand principles. If the demand for money is x and I flood the market with ten trillion dollars the demand is going to go down. Because there's such a huge supply. But because there's such a huge supply the value of the money is going down. When the value goes down the demand for money goes up. Leading to more money being printed which lowers the demand for a time and then since the value has gone down. The demand goes back up. Now Hypothetically this is supposed to be a balanced system this is how any supply and demand works. But the issue is fiat. By decree the government says this is the supply so your demand changes slowly. The supply can be changed on a whim. Your feelings a trillion dollars from 2 year's ago now and you best believe your going to be feelings all the money we are still printing! It doesn't stop. Each dollar in is just fractionally devaluing your money. So all your savings are becoming worth less and less day by day. While your demand keeps going up and instead of adressing the problem your being distracted with something that isn't the problem.\s\sYou all are currently being told that the corporations are the problem you don't have enough and it's really the federal reserve.eh a bit of apple and oranges a bit of truth. If all the extra money printed would be used in the market that the normal guy also uses (grocery etc) we would get affected. but that filthy speculative money of the ultra rich is not used in normal markets but in the luxury segment and for the most part as investment just to increase their amount of power. We dont realize this we're not directly affected by the steadily growing concentration of wealth of power. The fact that Bill Gates is the largest owner of farmland doesn't directly affect us. The fact that Blackrock & co are owning half the planet doesn't affect us directly. Our slavery remains abstract and 99% of us will remain clueless about the shape of our shackles. We will just take it as granted that we have to work 40 50 60 hours to just get by. It's just the way it is. It is that way because power is a beast that works in the shadows and we don't understand it. We're too exhausted by the work they demand from us and too distracted by the entertainment they provide.And that's not even taking into account the amount of greed and exploitation already present in 1960 lolHow can we get things like minimum wage tied to inflation?\s\sI like turtlesBy taking a hint from the rest of the world that has somehow managed with a *lot* less wealth to have a livable minimum wage *and* healthcare *and* retirement funds. While not having their roads bridges and plumbing collapsing all over.\s\sFirst step: stop waging war over half the world and *dramatically* cut your offense budget.When min wage law hikes are promoted a lot of people have begun demanding it not only be hiked to the current living waste at the very least but also be indexed automatically to inflation so its not reliant on politicians looking to keep their donors happy.  I think a number if other things in government are similarly linked.\s\sUnfortunatelythat can only pass if the current crop.of donor-prioritizing politicians buck the donor class to do it.  Catch-22.The Federal Reserve is an unelected banking industry cabal that runs America's monetary policy.  Their polices always advantages their corporate casinos effectively locking the American people into a captive economy.  The FED must be dissolved.  Period.Nobody ever wants to hear this but productivity shot up and scaled with workplace automation (computers). It's not worker's productivity that is rising so fast.There are economies of scale with everything and technology does help but you still need people on the other end. The Federal reserve printing trillions of dollars over the course of several decades probably played a bigger factor here than most people would be comfortable admitting.the hole in your argument is that those with the $$$ own everything produced by workers including the technology automatons and inventions developed by workers. So from your argument the wealthy elites will continue increasing wealth disparity because they have the wealth to begin with. That would result in a society of sick ineffectively educated homeless poverty wage labor citizens and their children and elderly existing as a disenfranchised slave labor sub-culture. Oh wait! It hAs resulted in a society of...They are holding themselves and the economy back by doing this as well. All this to keep people down. We have lost 60 years of a solid income multiplier due to their spite. With that we could have stayed at the front of education and innovation instead of slowing losing all our leads. We could have lifted the world up with us now we are starting to fall behind in many metrics.everyone would be fired20 of which are lost somewhere within the ""lost"" Pentagon expenses to fuck over just about everything and nobody is even pretending to care about it.That's pretty much the tip of the iceberg when you consider all of the massive transfers of wealth in the form of bailouts tax breaks wars and other disasters.If the gap increased from $0 to $16.75 the average gap is likely around $8.37 not $17.  Still trillions though.  Come to think of it he uses the phrase ""at least $17"" when rounding up to $17 who does that?[Receipts](https://time.com/5888024/50-trillion-income-inequality-america/)Has Catherine Austin Fitts crossed your radar?And corporations used a strong centralized government to do it.Does anyone have a clearer picture on these numbers? Probably a low ballMinimum wage increases are a price floor increase not a raise.There should be a class action lawsuit for reparations for the stolen $50T. All the $$$ is easily traceable to the descendants and sub corps through the decades.Work hard save money start a business  grow the business by putting everything you own up for collateral create jobs for people and more tax revenue for the government then have a communist tell a bunch of sheep that you owe them everything for your success! But if your business goes under and you loose everything it’s all your fault!Productivity increases have nothing to do with laborers. Machines computers streamlining and logistics are the source of productivity increases.Yes and the monetary benefits of those increases go to shareholders not even necessarily the people responsible for the innovations but the shareholders at their companies. If workplaces were democratically operated and owned by workers then the benefits of this production increase would go straight to the workers.Cops need to fill up these private prisons. That's why cops keep brutality between them and people in the community. Cops are forced to see everyone fit for private prison. Also [there is quota system](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+cops+arrest+quotas) that cops must arrest certain number - to get paid (?).""Are there no bankers?

I was really hoping you weren't a real personDidn't Mama Bear do the same thing?What if we put caps on charges like Japan does?Think just having transparency will automatically make a huge stint that will force hospitals to readjust pricing because the amount they are charging is simply criminal.What if we dropped the prices by letting people compare and such?I've read stories of someone getting a massive bill then asking the hospital for an itemized recipient and suddenly their charges are drastically reduced. Like they can't even justify their gouging when pressed on it. \s\sOne of the things people conveniently leave out when they ask how we can ""afford"" M4A is that having a single payer will drastically reduce costs. The federal and/or state governments won't get bent over like the rest of us do. Someone covered via private insurance can have the exact same treatment as someone covered under Medicare and the latter will be charged way less. So aside from having everyone covered you also end up with more realistic prices. The government won't be taking one thousand in tax dollars to purchase a single EpiPen for someone or they won't spend thousands for somebody getting a vicodin in the ER. \s\sPharma is far and away the biggest lobbyist. Hospitals and insurance crack the top 10. Billions are being spent to compromise politicians influence legislation and sponsor news media. The for-profit healthcare system does not want to lose their golden goose and once people realize how easily we can streamline our healthcare and reduce costs it'll be difficult to ever return to this ass backwards clusterfuck of a racket we have now. \s\sThe state I live in actually did a pretty good job of allowing people to get onto Medicaid during the pandemic. I was laid off for 10 months and it was a relief being able to have it. It sucks now needing to go back to getting insurance from my employer and paying massive fees and deductibles. The pandemic really should have been the final nail in the coffin for our system...you have all these people laid off because of shutdowns then you end up with all these people being uninsured during a pandemic. The fact that people are still trying to defend this bullshit gives me such little hope that itll ever be reformed. \s\sEven supposed ""left wing"" media like CNN or MSNBC is constantly shoving advertising from pharma or insurance down their viewer's throats. That's why they'll never bite the hand that feeds them and why they're also decidedly not left wing. \s\sHaving transparent hospital costs is ostensibly a bipartisan no-brainer. So is preventing drugs from costing significantly more than they do in other countries. Unless you work for the for-profit healthcare industry there should be no reason why you'd defend this bullshit. Most people think it's abhorrent that a drug can cost magnitudes more here than in Canada but since we are an oligarchy and not a democracy that doesn't really count for much.When we pay medical bills weren't just paying for ourselves.  We are paying for the nine other people that didn't pay.  Either you let socialism in the front door to take a thin slice of pie or experience capitalism kicking in our back doors to steal every pie and every future pie until we die.  It's not that complicated.Reminder that right wing pundit like Candace Owen actually talked about this and believe medical transparency is something that needs to be fought for which I absolutely agree. \s\sMedical transparency is as good as a nonpartisan plank as anything material and both left and right should embrace transparent pricing at the very least if they are somehow crazy enough to not support m4a ( or Medicare plus which is Tulsi's platform).One of the few policies trump did that helps Medicare 4 all .\s\s.\s\sHealthcare transparency ... thank you Trump on this oneThey got massive bailouts from the covid packages too. In return they have cut services to the underserved.\s\sHospital corporations like Cleveland Clinic have huge endowments in the $10 billion range.We’ve  all watched Bernie sanders get screwed not once but twice now we’ve all watched the squad stomped into dust by the democratic machine time and time again the United States political system exists to keep profits high and corporate hemogony in tact to sit here and to continue making a policy based argument is death by a 1000 cuts.

Their focus is not on ""what can we do to help Americans' lives be better"" but instead is ""how can we manipulate Americans' psyches so we can keep the gravy train coming"".\s\sProblem is messaging =/= substance.

I have cheap hobbies a job I enjoy a small home an old car and I don't have any desire to have more than that. I'd rather other people achieve a degree of comfort than live in luxury myself. It's bizarre that so many people fall for Capitalist propaganda telling them that they need to buy needless shit consume and hoard in order to be happy.of everything you just said the sad part is that a *billionaire* would not have to tone down ANY part of their way of life to help ease the suffering of the world. \s\sFuck if I just had ONE billion dollars...  I could give 80% of that away and me and my children would still never want for anything for the rest of our livesI had someone argue against basic income because they ""love their toys (motorcycles boats RVs etc...)"" How can we buy all our toys if there's more economic justice is essentially what they were saying.\s\sWe don't need austerity for economic justice.  \s\sIt's not one or the other that's a false choice.IMO what's really sad are the people that fall for propaganda not capitalist (I have nothing against capitalism) that makes them think their civic duty as an American is to consume. Go to the shopping mall and satisfy the two biggest addictions Americans have shopping and eating especially eating. Sometimes I wonder how these massive people can even take a shit they're so huge with a big SUV waiting outside the mall so they can get all that stupid shit they bought home stopping for jelly roll and donuts of course. Too prosperous for our own good sometimes. But capitalism is the only way this country can survive the Socialist experiment has been done in China and the former USSR and if memory serves a lot of people died due to starvation and homicide to avoid starvation and tyrannical government greed. That's why we have a second amendment to avoid just that. Death tolls were somewhere in the high Millions in China alone..... I'm sticking with capitalism but agree that especially before the pandemic people just spent money and stuffed their faces in general kind of sad.Exactly!I agree about the basic survival needs. Re-distribution of wealth is a slippery slope however. I'd like to see some of the elite put their money where their mouth is so far as helping the American people but I don't think most of them really care about the American people only themselves. I highly doubt a wealthy politician can relate to someone who works 9 hours a day to barely scrape by. And although $600 is $600 it is kind of a slap in the face when compared to what many people have lost already. They want more of themselves and less for everyone else.Tbh I'd love to have a 40 bed mansion. I would house all of my friends that are struggling to make ends meet all the homeless I meet every week from donating food all those who just need an escape for a few days / weeks / months from shitty situations.\s\sAlthough none of this would be necessary if we were given livable wages or universal standards for needs. But still. I'd love to be a millionaire to redistribute the fortune.We shouldn't have to break out the guillotines to get our money back.  Yet if they want to fight us for every couch penny.  So be it.  There is more of us than there are of them by design.  Let's see how it plays out.I could not agree more. But I think we're going to have to be breaking out the guillotines because they have no intention of making us whole again financially or otherwise. Hopefully I'm wrong. So you have to see what happens and that's pretty easy considering there's very little we can do but see what happens and then act accordingly. For now I'm not going to jump the gun although part of me wants to. Just going to watch and wait for a little while see if any of those wonderful campaign promises actually happen especially with Bernie Sanders and Trump conveniently agreeing with him on the $2000 emergency survival money. Very very odd so let's wait and see but keep on your guard and read between the lines IMO.See that's what so many ""progressives"" don't get. The wealthy don't make any distinction regarding the size of your ask. You're a filthy peasant! Asking for ***anything*** is perceived as a direct threat to their wealth and privilege! They won't tolerate it. Rip the veil from your eyes - we're still living in the middle ages as far as they're concerned.And they are laughing their asses all the way to the bank. I could not agree more my friend.Superrich eat what we eat. Breath the same oxygen we do. There is nothing to feel jealous about.I occasionally pity them what with the dark empty holes they have where their hearts should be. They are not well in mind or spirit. Then I remember that they kill people who work for them in pursuit of more zeros on their bank accounts and I get angry again. Billionaires are dangerous predators and they need to be removed from the gene pool.I don't think it's so much about jealousy or who is super rich; it's who holds the real power (and the fact that they don't give a crap about the rest of us). Whether or not they breathe or eat I'm not sure how that has baring. Genghis Khan Hitler Fidel Castro the list goes on ad infinitum all ate and breathed but I highly doubt the super Elites eat what most people eat because most people could not afford a personal chef cook extremely expensive food for them every night etc...IMOWatch how fast this incident fades in the ether  because Americans memories suck and this story won’t receive mainstream attentionIt has a pushbar and a spotlight on it!\s\sMaybe if it was an older crown vic there'd be a chance it was a retired cop car that was sold to the public but when it's a car that at most could be 10 years old?

They let Fred Hampton live right until he went from feeding poor black children to feeding poor children. His intention to regulate the Federal Reserve was one crime too many for Kennedy. Having power and rejecting the elite capitalist class is a death sentence even today. The lack of public assassinations today is due to the lack of people with any power fighting for the poor and especially their lack of an ability to accomplish anything if they try. The elite used the carrot and stick approach until it was heresy to accomplish anything beyond empty promises to get elected; either we can donate millions to your party and help you get elected or we can kill you so what was that about a tax hike? When people say they'd kill to have a billion dollars they actually aren't joking. Imagine who a greedy person would kill to protect multi-billions after they've gotten it.

Then abolish college all together it is just a place for privilaged kids to party and fuck.Depends on the profession. Certain things like business really don't need more than a 2 year or an ""extra degree"" like MBA.  Others like programming engineering chemistry etc. A 4 year is more important.  There's no real ""learn calculus"" on the job...Also colleges are a financial scam. They are not 'institutions of higher learning'. They are just one more way that investment banks have hijacked a revenue stream to use to play the stock market.\s\sColleges have endowment funds in the billions. Growing this fund is  their goal not providing a useful education.This of course is over-generalized.  Some parents and students kill themselves working and borrowing.  All the education-relating debt in this country is not reflected in student loans and it isn't all owed by rich parents who raised privileged kids.\s\sThe solution isn't to bash education students or their families but to make colleges and trade schools affordable (or free) for those who want to attend either one--and to respect all those who need to work for a living.does no one here realize why they don't want to cancel the debts? doing so would have the same effect as 2008. these debts are highly collateralized ang financial institutions have been bundling them as investment instruments.\s\sforgiving those debts would cause a system shock to the stock market.Biden is a scummy piece of shit.

Like every politician in a position of power does...Every time this happen I wonder if we should put the limit to 1 mandate. \s\sBut that would mean no carrier politician like sanders.More significant is that the two Delaware senators voted against the minimum wage increase. One of them is Biden’s stooge.Damn it feels good tweeting all these memes at her to shame her.Oh how fast they fall huh? You don't change the Democratic party. The party changes you!Sinema is a liar and traitor to hard working people in this Country. She has sold us out and has to be primaried. It’s one thing to work with colleagues across the political spectrum. It’s entirely another to abandon Dems on a fundamental tenet of policy.[any elected democrat] is a liar and traitor to hard working people in this CountrySo not only do elected officials deem their representative responsibility fungible they are also sociopaths.How many more of these Two=Faced Monsters are among Us ?She’s fkn 45 years old...Money talks.It also serves uwu 🥰👎🏻🤗I love do-gooder turned whore stories.That was a long time ago and possibly not sincere to begin with. \s\sSpecter ran as a Democrat. When that was not open to him he ran as a Republican until he could no longer win a Republican primary.

They are all working together.Doing a touchdown dance is not a symptom. And you're a bit too forgiving of this piece of shit molded into a Karen.She didn't have to take the fall though it needed 60 to pass as an amendment and zero Republicans voted yes. So she did it from her heart.AOC is not this bad yet but if Sinema doesn't lose her seat she eventually will be.You’re saying Sinema staying in office will make AOC worse?  Is that an assessment of the bar being ever-lowered or something regarding AOC that I’m missing?Only Tulsi can save us now.All these bitches will nvr pay for screwing ppl lives 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬This isn't her failing. This is her volunteering for villain rotation. Every other Democrat betrayed us just as much as she did but as long as she successfully distracts us none of them will catch any flak for it.OK I see what's going on.\s\sSinema is challenging Joe Manchin for the throne of the moderate democrat which would give HER the tying vote in the Senate.\s\sThe next two years will be a race to see who is furthest to the right.\s\sI hope I am wrong though!I think you're on to something and making my call now for Manchin.  West Virginia seems way more conservative and uneducated compared to Arizona.AOC isn’t far behind Sinema. In 10 years she will become Nancy Pelosi.Buddy look at the ads AOC ran when she was running for congress and look at her now. It didn't take ten years it took three.This is my take. I’m so sad to say that. I don’t know why but intuition says she’s the exact personality to be manipulated into believing “Compromise is necessary to move anything forward” and then the next  thing you know “Sorry we shot down healthcare again in 2036 but we had to reach across the aisle. My hands are tied!”Downvoted for being right.AOC has denounced Sinema and Manchin for their opposition to the minimum wage. There is no comparison. [Cortez](https://www.reddit.com/r/AOCPrez2028/) is the leader the progressive movement (supplanting Bernie). Sinema is Republican-lite. One-hundred-eighty degree difference.bullshit. this is the type of garbage that keeps the left from taking ANY power in the party. infighting and sectarianism. AOC is an ally to the left without a doubt and the fact that she didn’t push jimmy dore’s stupid fucking M4A vote idea (wouldn’t have worked) doesn’t change thatSame boobs in 50.She is a scumbag piece of shit who dresses like a ho so she can be pimped out by the neoliberals and republicans a fraud who portrayed herself as a poor people’s champion but she was a lying deceitful political street walker everyone notice how she touched to try and get McConnell attention on the back to show off her little political poledance for him thumbs down for him he straight ignored her too like a true pimpMr. Smith goes to Washington alternate dark side ending*Kyrsten Sinema's Swamp Tale*\s\shttps://www.dailyposter.com/p/kyrsten-sinemas-swamp-taleVote based on identity get politics based on class but only against workers.

Get rid of the police then see how quickly you need to buy a gun for yourself.I already own multiple firearms and a ton of ammunitionIf the cops keep operating as they are people are going to have to buy arms to protect themselves FROM the police. Cops rarely ever stop crime especially violent crime. They either show up to a situation that they aren't trained to handle and completely fuck things up or they show up after the fact and serve as the clean up crew.

Just as lawyers are doing their job by putting people away on drug charges and furthering their career.Indeed.  The problem is that most people have been fed copraganda their whole lives and have no idea what their job actually is.  To the point where the conditioning is so strong that they can literally see centuries-long history of systemic violence and abuse and they start using wild conjecture to come to conclusions like ""they need MORE funding/training/etc"" and ""it must just be a culture problem"" etc. instead of simply applying Occam's razor and immediately coming to the reasonable and obvious conclusion that their job has been shit the whole time.There are songs condemning anyone in a leadership/authority position \s\sAnother brick on the wall is complaining about teachers the whole time \s\sMany of Muse's songs talk about how everyone in power is corrupt \s\sA general point of music is rebelling against a perceived authority figureFirefighters have to deal with fires.

They might vote Green or another third party. Maybe they will just not vote but I have never seen anyone here suggest they would vote Republican. \s\sIt is not about the Republicans it is about moving the Democrats left and telling them that if they want our vote they need to earn it.\s\s[There’s a video of Lawrence O’Donnell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=FqRNnIMDkUY&feature=emb_logo) years ago saying something that would get him fired from MSNBC in a heartbeat:\s\s> “If you want to pull the major party that is closest to the way you’re thinking to what you’re thinking you must show them that you’re capable of not voting for them. **If you don’t show them that you’re capable of not voting for them they don’t have to listen to you. I promise you that. I worked within the Democratic Party.

Clueless unsympathetic POS.  Probably sucked Trump’s dick as well.Wrong he’s the democrats’ scapegoat for telling the people why they couldn’t pass any progressive laws or legislation. Both parties don’t give afAnd swallowed.No it's not. West Virginia is a +30 republican state. Without Manchin we would be having a McConnel led senate.\s\sedit: WHY THE FUCK IS THIS UPVOTED HERE?!?!?And what is that getting us? Nothing just like if republicans were in charge. Democrats are the fake opposition party.I mean you right.6 weeks and your fired.I somehow got recommended this post and I am literally dumbfounded by how little sense this makes. There are currently 50 Democratic Senators. If people had chosen to withhold their vote from Democrats they thought weren't good enough there would be even fewer. Instead of the meager infrastructure bill we are likely to pass there wouldn't even be a glimmer of hope of passing any meaningful legislation. In what world would that be better?\s\sThis is why Bernie and others like him campaign for Democrats in general elections. Because he's not an idiot. He cares about immediate outcomes for working people. Anyone who chooses not to vote when they know full well that one party is closer to the outcomes they would prefer does not.[When you elect a ""centrist"" like Biden it guarantees we won't get what we need for at least 8 years](https://i.imgur.com/itzWfVI.png) because if Biden/Harris do two terms that will be 8 years of no medicare for all significant climate action or end to the police state and if they lose reelection then you have a guarantee that a Republican will come in and not help us for their 4 years. So either way you slice it you are screwed for eight years no matter what when you ""vote blue no matter who."" So you are better off not electing the centrist voting third party then working to get a real progressive elected in four years. \s\s[There’s a video of Lawrence O’Donnell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=FqRNnIMDkUY&feature=emb_logo) years ago saying something that would get him fired from MSNBC in a heartbeat:\s\s> “If you want to pull the major party that is closest to the way you’re thinking to what you’re thinking you must show them that you’re capable of not voting for them. **If you don’t show them that you’re capable of not voting for them they don’t have to listen to you.

Though most of us also have far more honor than Democratic partisans what we do not have is a prior promise to support the organization in exchange for participation in their primary process.

Biden is as much a part of the problem as Manchin and Sinema. He has NO clue how to use the bully pulpit in order to push his own agenda. He should be holding Manchin's feet over the fire by threatening to have the DOJ investigate all of the shady shit his family is involved in. He could also go to WV and talk to Manchin's constituents directly and point out how their own senator is actively pushing out key benefits of the BBB plan that WV families desperately need to improve their lives. Unfortunately Biden is too weak to consider being like FDR or LBJ.Thats what happens when you wont fight for M4A.Politico has been forced to deal with reality.\s\sSo they do.

Warren or Biden 2020!Lmao shut upBarf. Go home.Your trolling has zero nuance or wit. You're obviously up past your normal hours. Or you're still mourning the Night Mother not winning in 2016.Gee it all makes sense! Warren's got nothing left so she resorts to pedantic smear tactics. She's revealed herself to be the biggest Fauxgresssive of them all. Warren is a spoiler candidate she is not our friend and she knows her chances are fading quick. I can't wait for Iowa.She's trying to drag Bernie down with her. He's got the most loyal supporters of all candidates it's clear to any campaign strategist that smearing Bernie won't aid you at all quite the opposite.We’re going to need her supporters to get us over the hump. Let’s not alienate them now by attacking her campaign in this way. While I don’t necessarily disagree with anything you said I think we can let nature take its course here. \s\sShe’s falling and Bernie is surging. That’s what really matters.Another trash article that calls this a turnaround.""Famously curmudgeonly""\s\sShut up or tell the whole truth for once PoliticoAnd of course now she plays the ""gender card"" (the news story on CNN and others today). Nothing could be lower. She's DISGUSTING.\s\sAll part of the plan though it doesn't surprise me at all. Warren has been a spoiler candidate from day one. I'll never understand how progressives could ever get behind her when she didn't even endorse Bernie in 2016 (not to mention her weekly lies).\s\sImagine the campaign money that went to Warren that should've gone to Sanders. Imagine the weak minded that will follow her lead when she endorses someone other than Bernie.Agreed. Elizabeth Warren is the quintiessential example of blood-sucking lawyer period. She's smart enough to right from wrong but she doesn't care because he were only allegiance is to who pays her. Yuck.Dripping with sexism... y'all claim to be progressive but you're not and you can't even see itOutside of her gender and her native american heritage what is the allure to Liz (over Bernie)?She can get progressives to vote for her (apparently not!) by giving lip service to progressive values without actually fighting for progressive causes.Libs who think the only problem in America is corruption and only warren can fix itShe’s corporate friendly.She has a plan for that....  Actually I really admired Warren's fight against big banks and creation of the CFPB but I feel that there was little carrythrough to legislation that actually prevents the next meltdown.  She has all the right words but doesn't seem to be able to put them into action in a way that helps us.It’s the same allure Obama had. Someone who isn’t a white man saying progressive things who will ultimately fail to live up to the progressive rhetoric.\s\sA vote for warren is a vote for the status quo. Only sanders and yang represent meaningful change.She's Hillary 2.0. That's pretty much it.Warren has fucked upShe listened to the wrong advice. Then again she's the one who hired those advisors.She has a plan /sAre you referring to her stance on M4A or am I out of the loop on something?Ahhhhhh YES that headlineDivision is not a good move.You might want to have a talk with Warren about that.They won’t stop the revolution.When was Warren ever a progressive?She's between 1/64th and 1/1024th progressive. That's good enough for some people.That one brief moment she said that she agreed with BernieWhen she was running for Senate> When was Warren ever a progressive?\s\sShe came up with the consumer financial protection bureau. Other than that she was a republican corporate lawyer for a long time. Maybe that time made her realize they were evil.I honestly think she could of broke far more leftist-populist than she ended up.  There was a point going into 2016 where she was potentially the one who could of led the opposition.  She could of run and been in Bernie’s place back then and now.\s\sBut she likely hired beltway establishment “experts” who advised her not to challenge Hillary.  To play ball.  Don’t rock the boat and Hillary will grant her a plum spot and maybe one very limited in scope policy to champion.  Warren bought into their bullshit (because quite frankly she lacks the courage backbone and clarity of vision necessary for real leadership) refused to run in 2016 played coy and refused to endorse Bernie who she supposedly is a hair’s breadth away from in policy and thus sealed her fate.\s\sWhat is now the working class leftist-independent-populist Bernie Tulsi Nina AOC etc coalition could of been Warren’s.  But she got played by the Clintonites (probably pretty easily) and consequently reduced to the Dem establishment’s last ditch option to trick voters into buying their bullshit for another cycle.  A bargain bin Obama as she doesn’t even have his talent for oration.\s\sThis coalition was Liz’s to lead going into 2016.  If she had stepped up she could have very likely been in Bernie’s position today.  But she blinked multiple times and lost her chance.\s\sThe lesson for everyone else especially new candidates: \s\sDon’t be Liz.\s\sDon’t listen to establishment “experts” advise you to play ball.  They are not there to help you.  They are there to undermine your actual influence and protect the status quo.  If you actually want to take power away from the corrupt and murderous neolibs and Deep State and empower the People then Bernie Tulsi and AOC are the path to follow.Bern it up or burn it downAfter ""progs"" get their selfies with Liz she has nothing else they want that Bernie didn't have first and better.downvote in less than a minute.\s\stry again!The cranky warren supporters are out downvoting like mad.Up to 96% now.\s\sAnother fail from the Warren camp.\s\s:)What race is this man?

Phone-banking and canvassing is important. Building the rhetoric necessary to counteract bad-faith attacks is important too.No you're right. Everyone here should phonebank and canvass. Register people inform them. Don't waste your time with winemoms on twitter bashing Bernie. We are here to win. And that means work.It's a fair point but in 2016 Hillary was still slightly ahead of Bernie in most national polling. Yes we should phonebank and canvass and do all those face-to-face encounters to get everyone in our community on the Bernie train. \s\sThat said many of us her are really noticing something spectacular about Elizabeth Warren. Just last week the general consensus was that EW was at least *somewhat* less power craven and deplorable than Hillary Clinton. When Hillary acted like a jerk it wasn't a big deal because that was what people had come to expect from her. That's the difference.The division that has been sowed amongst the progressive wing isn't good for any of us. It's all too convenient. Biden knows his only chance of winning the nomination is to stay at or near the top of the field just like Romney did in 2012 and Paul/Santorum were surging. He knows Warren has the best chance of uniting the progressive and moderate wing and taking her out is essential to his campaign strategy. With Warren no longer a factor they can focus their efforts on Bernie and his 'electability issue' and secure the nomination. For Bernie to sweep the nomination it's imperative that she takes votes away from Biden/Buttigieg and stays in the field. The Republican party hoping for a repeat of 2016 knows this as well and they are banking on the fact that the progressives will cannabalize themselves; there are forces at work to ensure this happens. Just look at all the conservative outlets who are eating this Sanders/Warren drama up. Whatever your opinion on the current news of late just remember Sanders and Warren voters must stay united to beat Biden and ultimately Trump otherwise it will be a very uphill battle for the entire progressive wing.Iowa 2020 Election \s\s[Caucus Voter Pre-Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24 2020 \s\s[Caucus](https://www.aclu-ia.org/en/how-find-your-caucus-site): February 3 2020 \s\s[General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3 2020Liz is now making the pitiful claim that she is the candidate to ""unify the party"".

Or at least one of them was.When a civil rights icon like John Lewis had discussions with another influential black congressman who was also involved in the Civil Rights movement like Jim Clyburn that slogans like Defund the Police is hurting the Black Lives Matter movement and is going to hurt Democrats in this election then maybe it’s time to pay attention to their warnings instead of listening to a 31 year old bartender representing a gentrified liberal bubble district in NYC.Lmao what truce? She hasn’t stopped[This might help AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1261025403071803393?s=20) Both the Texas governor and progressives have used this incident to push their own opinions about the GND. \sI don't know how this relates to the Green New Deal.\s\sMass power outages happened in Texas because of Texas's strange and ridiculous decision to have their own power grid for the primary reason of avoiding federal regulations. Because Texas did not have federal regulations that would require energy infrastructure to cold weather capabilities natural gas equipment and wind turbines were all interfered by the snow and freezing temperatures. \s\sThis article explains it quickly and well:\s\s\shttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/why-texas-energy-grid-unable-handle-winter-storms-n1258049This is petty of me and only thinly related to the context of the tweet but every time I read/hear ""Green New Deal"" it makes me twitch just from how weird it *sounds*. The cadence of the pronunciation doesn't fit itself well into any sentence no matter how you alter the stresses and the combination of tones is painfully displeasing. It creates this sense of ""These words do not belong together"" rather like a nonsense phrase used for memorization which causes the mind to stop processing them for meaning and just dismiss them as auditory noise representing a vague concept.\s\s...which is basically what the GND is but anyway.\s\sThe name of it sounds like a college student's branding project thrown together approximately twenty minutes before it was due. It's just silly.You're right that the name sounds bad. The text of the resolution is actually even more like a last-minute college project. I read it over a lunch break a while back and I kept grinding my teeth. It's an absurd hill to die on.How about she shows solidarity with the people of Texas and not make everything about her. SMHThe GND is not any form of tangible legislative action so essentially what she's saying here is that just saying you want to do something about the climate is enough to prevent problems like this.\s\sThis is basically one tiny baby-step above ""thoughts and prayers.""Let’s not be assholes. The Texas infrastructure was built on generations of fossil kickbacks. It’s not just *snow* it’s erratic climate behavior. We don’t defend AOC here nor do we downplay climate change.\s\sEDIT: the issue with the GND wasn’t its ideals and goals but rather how\sIt was used as a purity test during the primaries (and beyond) to cynically trap electable liberal pols. There’s nothing wrong with a non-binding value statement when it is actually a genuine value statement. Texas is actually in the shit right now because of their climate deniability. Their value statement was to double down.I'm not downplaying climate change I'm snarking about her 'non binding resolution of values which will cost nothing' being an effective bulwark against climate change.The problem is that people are dying from the cold and stupid decisions made by Texas RIGHT NOW and what exactly does grandstanding about the GND do to fix that?> The Texas infrastructure was built on generations of fossil kickbacks. It’s not just snow it’s erratic climate behavior.\s\sMost infrastructure was. Texas is suffering in particular because they deliberately kept their network infrastructure separated from the rest of the country to avoid federal regulation. (Even after the federal government subsidised it ridiculously.)\s\sIf all their power was green and for some reason it under performed you'd have the same issues because they don't have ways to bring in power from elsewhereThis is why Dems have this perception of having a messaging problem. It’s cuz idiots like Bernie and the squad keep spending more damn bashing Dems than they do the GOP. And how are Dems turning their back on the working class when wages are rising when essentially a jobs bill was passed with the Infrastructure Bill when millions more now have healthcare because more have enrolled in Obamacare this past year etc… What the hell has the GOP done for the working class? Hell what the has HE done for the working class?! I’m so sick of this curmudgeon!Yup. Stimmy child tax credit boosted ACA subsidies infrastructure bill eviction moratorium and a whole bunch of worker-friendly executive actions. And a massive social spending package that's supported by nearly every Dem save for a guy in a Trump+100000000 state. Not to mention the Dem-run states and localities that already have universal pre-K free after school $15 minimum wage extended protection for renters additional paid time off and so on.\s\sBut yeah other than all that Dems have totally turned their backs on the working class.His individual points aren’t wrong and actually pretty good but the facts are that a) he’s done fuck all to help anyone but himself despite being entirely capable of writing these bills himself and b) how the hell does anyone NOT get that ‘working class’ is just code for ‘white people’ these days?Black people get it.\s\sWhich is why we never supported him as a whole.Back to Bernie doing Bernie.  Its his ""status quo.""Okay if he’s still alive in 2024 he’s definitely running again.  Ugh.This might sound crazy but if it wasn’t for my man Harry Reid SANDERS WOULD HAVE RAN AGAINST OBAMA IN 2012!!I kinda don't think he will but particularly if Joe runs again I don't think so. It's hard to imagine him gearing up a run in the middle of Joe's term and attacking Joe while he's in the White House. But then it's Bernie so who fucking knows. That ego is out of control.He keeps falling back on this ""us vs them"" rhetoric and his base goes rabid for the red meat (much like another Qult).  \s\sHe needs to realize that more progressive policies come with more democrats voted in.  Primarying and replacing people like Manchin and Sinema in deep red and purple states with his acolytes just give a win for the republicans.\s\sDude needs to grow the fuck up especially at his age.He drags people down to prop himself up. Cause he's got not much to offer.I think Sanders is failing and has turned his back on the working class.But bernie’s entire support base is the… non working class… how can you say you support the working class while only focusing on people who don’t work?Nothing says for the working class as much as giving a portion of Americans a one time no-strings attached debt forgiveness lottery ticket and giving the rationale that the extra money will flow down and lift all the people up.He’s finger wagging again in anticipation for the 2024 grift he’s going to launch next yearBlack voters aren't fooled into voting republican. So who's the fool here?1. He's not a democrat\s2. He can't muster the energy to attack republicans\s3. He himself hasn't done shit\s\sSo whats the point of this? Democrat inadequacy is not an excuse for republican obstruction. What did Bernie do during the Trump administration's control of government? Was he more successful?""Perennial loser claims he has sole key to victory""\s\sPiss off traitor.Of course Bernie is wrong and won’t ever get why he is wrong. \s\sDemocrats started 2021 believing they were going to repeat FDR’s work which was delusional with a 50/50 Senate and a super slim House majority. \s\sThe Build Back Better bill was a disaster and a sign that Democrats grossly overestimated what was in their ability to get done. Hopefully they will flush it this year and break out the parts that people understand so they have something to show in the general election because nobody cares about the infrastructure bill they already passed.Bernie is always saying this. He's just repeating himself with the same talking points for years.\s\s""Democrats have abandoned the working class!' - yeah they're doing so by pushing the BBB plan which targets Right To Work laws striking them down strengthening unions and this isn't even counting the massive push to raise minimum wage across the country.""Working class."" I wish this bleach demon would say what he means for once.The GOP pretends to care about the white working classWhat modern day democrats in the house and senate are anti-LGBTQ+? I’m afraid she’s went off the deep end if she’s starting to place traits of the most trump controlled republicans on her more moderate counterparts. Even Manchin isn’t anti-LGBTQ+ or something like that.I don’t have a problem necessarily with primarying bad representatives and I would say anti-LGBTQ or NRA backed Dems to not be so great if they’re in a Blue District.\s\sBut how many is that really? It doesn’t seem to be the Dems as a whole so her complaint about the establishment seems like a claim about w couple people.Dan Lipinski of IL-3 (D+6) is probably the best/only example as he was successfully primaried by a candidate supported by Justice Democrats almost exactly a year ago today.Manchin was the only democrat that voted with republicans on the trans sports amendment. He's not pro LGBTQ+.Henry Cuellar (D-TX) has a fairly poor score from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBT issues and doesn't believe gender identity should be a protected class.Didn't literally every Democrat in the House vote for the Equality Act?Joe Manchin apparently. But other than that I cant think of many.\s\sJoe manchin is basically a Republican tbhYou mean like the anti-choice candidate that Bernie campaigned with and defended campaigning with right in the middle of the Trump admin?  \s\shttps://www.npr.org/2017/04/20/524962482/sanders-defends-campaigning-for-anti-abortion-rights-democratAs late as 2008 he was against gay marriage.\s\s In 2006 he said marriage equality was a states' rights issue and he opposed federal recognition of gay rights.Communists just love clamping down on reproductive rights. Look at china for most of modern history.Ugh *of course* he did that. He doesn't give a fuck about anything that doesn't affect white males such as himself. Same as always.And yet she rails against Joe Manchin and Abigail Spanberger both of whom represent deep red Trump areas.WV is R+19 while Spanberger’s district is R+6. Her district is certainly red but I’m not sure if I would call it *deep* red though it’s the same rating as Budget Palin Boebert’s district. Still AOC doesn’t rail against Spanberger for her voting record she rails against her for (correctly) pointing out that “defund the police” was poor messaging.Is red-blue colorblindness a thing? She might have that.What about the representative from New York who is in a safe seat but doesn't do fuck all except play a high stakes online popularity game for her own benefit while shitting on everyone she should be trying to build bridges with? \s\sIf she was this bad at getting along with people when she was a bartender I could see why she'd be forced to seek a career in politics; I wouldn't even waste a dime being at a bar in front of someone who is this much of a miserable asshat.I honestly genuinely wonder how other members in the House feel about her. I think we got a glimpse of it when she was voted against to lead that committee but I wonder at large how they feel.Call me a corporatist neoliberal shitlib but [I think these people should be a higher priority to remove from congress.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html)Okay?? She never ever targets Rethuglicanz. And that’s for a reason.Too bad the sales pitch that attracts the most voters makes the far-left gag so the winning strategy will slowly lose the angsty left and hand Republicans another term.There’s literally like 1 of them left.with Lipinski gone who's left? Henry Cuellar?Well yeah but don't expect her cult to fack-check her.For me the “safe because they’re paid off by [insert big bad wolf corporation or conservative org here] who control things behind the scenes“ was the eye roll on the top of the shit sundae. Scapegoats are what we use when engaging with people who disagree with us and dealing with complicated issues is just too damn hard. \s\sI remember listening to Preet Bhahrara interview a gun control activist who explained that the reason we can’t have gun control is that the NRA works against the activists and controls everything behind the scenes. At the time it sounded like a cop out to excuse the failures of the gun control movement to really engage people who disagree in good faith. A year later the NRA is bankrupt infiltrated by Russian agents and a disgrace to all but the complete fringe. And we still don’t have gun control.The role of the NRA in getting to this point is undeniable. If race is the third rail of American politics then NRA stuck a jumper on the tracks and arc'ed it. They tied no gun restrictions to white supremacy. They also pushed an agenda which successfully made it to the Supreme Court to make the kind of weapons control that's done for anything but a handgun extremely difficult to do with handguns. The result is a rate of gun violence that we've all just resigned ourselves to taking for granted. After a while it perpetuates itself because fear casts a long shadow and we've lost the capacity to be shocked by any of it.It's easier to pretend that your ideas are being stopped by a handful of bad actors (wall street dnc the establishment the deep state) than it is to confront the realities of complex issues or worse admit that maybe your views aren't as popular as you think. It's the constant talking point that AOC Trump Bernie use to explain their failures and opposition because they can't defend their ideas and obstacles in a proper way. AOC isn't trying to do a critique of Joe Manchin she's signalling to her base that her opponents are not legitimate and anyone defending them is being manipulated by a cabal. It's populism and borderline stoking of conspiracy theories.That person was absolutely correct. The NRA was really sophisticated in how it lobbied against gun control and turned what used to be a fairly bipartisan issue into a bitter culture war spat. Just because a year later they are mostly defunct doesn't mean that decades of lobbying and advertising has fallen away. \s\sNot to mention that with their fall gun control activists have been seeing more and more success.She knows Progressives can only win in D safe seats lol. They haven't won a single competitive seat.If you define ""progressive"" as ""Dems that officially designate as being part of the Progressive Caucus"" then technically that's not true there have been a couple cases of progressives winning competitive seats. Katie Porter and Andy Kim come to mind.Bernie and NRA love each other. Is she mad she’s becoming irrelevant more and more?It also begs the question that if those representatives (or at least reps with similar platforms) have been in that role for a long time that moderation could be why it is a “safe” seat. Have absolutely had districts that were considered safe flip because Dems pushed a more liberal candidate. The problem with big tent politics is you can’t just assume a safe district will remain safe if you move outward policy-wise (unlike identity politics where as long as you keep key components you can fluctuate on everything else without imploding a la current Republican Party)AOC is a great example of that herself. She is pulling less in her super safe seat than Crowley did.\s\sCrowley regular got 80%+ of the general vote. She got 78% in 2018 and 75% in 2020.The big donors/wall st/special interests thing is the trumpist populism of the left. I admit I fell for it at first with Bernie but good lord you'd think 4-5 years later now we'd be able to acknowledge the dangers and toxicity of populism. It's a cult.Wall Street is such a circlejerk thing to complain about. No not everyone working in finance is pure evil and they're certainly not manipulating everything behind the scenes. They have jobs that overall benefit society but like any job does need regulations. Though it isn't a bad thing that she's dedicated herself to upsetting and attacking the major industry of NYC which is probably the only part of New York State that would tolerate her trying to be a senator or governor.Seeing how Reddit has acted on the Gamestop fiasco it is clear that they have no clue of even the basic idea of modern finance. For them ""Wall Street"" is a voodoo system with mystical properties and some people somehow profit.Bernie literally got elected by the NRA.>Thats OK beause bernieI mean...you can be entirely left aside from one single issue and still want to run for that office...Name names or it never happened.To people against my STRAWMAN.... There are STRAWMEN in seats because REASONS.\s\sAnd therefore I tweet!Funny that she's never had anything to say as far as I can tell about Sanders' complicated relationship with the NRA.Wait who is she talking about here?Cuellar probably comes close.How many house reps in safe D districts are actually anti-LGBTQ+?  I know Dan Lipinski was one but he did get primaries out last year (and good riddance).  But who else?Just the one apparently...\- My policies/ ideas are a surefire win to expand the Dem majority in the House\s\s\- Most of my issues are with Dems in safe blue seats.\s\sPick one.Everyone in the nra is anti lgbtI *do* think there's a such thing as Democratic representatives who could stand to be more liberal with certain things but the answer to this is not for a sitting rep to back primary challengers. There's nothing wrong with primaries but that money would be better spent on unseating Republicans so it's unreasonable for the Justice Dems to get pissed at the party for their policy on people who work with challengers.\s\sI also think the caucus as a whole is *well* aware of who the ""unnecessarily right wing Democrats"" are. There's a reason that Cuellar's challenger got a lot more endorsements than he did and no sitting reps besides Pelosi and the DCCC chair endorsed him.Here's my thing...\s\sFor a person who claims to be dialed into what is happening in this country she is so damn oblivious of the fact that the Republicans are applauding her efforts to destroy the Democrats from the inside. WE need to primary her ass and let her see what it feels like.Jesus I’m not looking forward to the day when she changes her legal name to Alexandria Ocommunist-CortezBloomberg is not a big donnor has no special interests in gun control. \s\s\shttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/mike-bloombergs-gun-control-outspends-nra-helps-democrats-win-virginia.htmlI don’t necessarily mind primary challenges as much as some others do. It’s a democracy people have the right to primary someone if they don’t feel they represent them.\s\sBut how many Dems is she talking about here?https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1231412884539879424She can't count can she?She's right but also wrong. A frustrating place to be for sure.\s\sI do still like though how she doesn't pretend Republicans are ever genuine or truthful in their words or actions.And yet she herself has one of the worst Politifact ratings for being truthful of any House Dem. Something like 80% of her statements are rated partly false false or ""pants on fire"".\s\sWe really don't need a Trump of the left.The gun control debate makes me want to lie down with a wet rag on my forehead.\s\sThe second-biggest reason (after conservative fearmongering) we can't get basic reforms done is because of lefty overreach at home and abroad. About half the country - not just Republicans - think that those reforms are the first part of a process that ends with them stripped of their right to own firearms. And they're not entirely unjustified in thinking that. The example of the UK as well as certain other European countries shows that it can happen and the Very Woke People who keep shooting their mouths off about mass confiscation and registration make it so much easier for conservatives to convince people that that is what we're aiming at. The idea of having to beg the government for permission to own a shotgun or a hunting rifle is repugnant to hundreds of millions of Americans including myself.I would consider myself an extremist on the issue of the Second Amendment in that I want a Twenty-Eighth Amendment repealing it entirely. I bring this up not to start a discussion about our disparate views on the topic because I'm as unlikely to change your mind on this as you are mine; I bring this up instead only because I have one request:\s\sPoint me to those influential Democrats calling for anything remotely close to my preferred policy on this topic if you genuinely believe they are somehow making it easier for Republicans to fearmonger about what the mainstream left/liberal position is.> hundreds of millions of Americans including myself.\s\sRoughly 60 million adult Americans own guns so I think you're off by a fair bit there.The number of ""leftists"" who have unironically defended Bernie for voting in favor of an NRA-sponsored bill that immunized gun manufacturers from lawsuits.... my god.There are conservative POC who side with the NRA and are anti LGBTQ- they voted for Trump in greater numbers this time then they did last time. Take that on first babe 👌I wonder if anyone told AOC if Bernie voted against the “Children’s Health Insurance Program” that 9.6 million Children get their healthcare from and including the healthcare she got as a Child lol. \s \sReminder that Clyburn Pelosi & Schumer all voted for the program in the House while Bernie didn’t.**Participate in deciding the future of the sub!**\s\s * [Voting Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSca7bqVFp1gEUUsR_iy9NIFo3VppzYN8j71-_yGbIY88hOzkA/viewform)\s * [Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/jsv1q2/ess_lets_talk_about_the_future_of_the_sub_2020/)\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

She called out Kamala Harris's hypocrisy on jailing people for smoking weed when she smoked it herself and didn't become a complete cuck like Bernie did when Biden and the rest of the centrists dropped out to back the guy. At least Tulsi had the balls to not listen to her stupid Dem party since they are paid to lose by the same donor class that pays republicans to win.Do you have any issues with the idea itself? If so please voice them. If you just want to dump on Dore that's fine too but him supporting Gabbard has absolutely no bearing on the idea of forcing a floor vote on M4A.Thank you OP.\s\sr/antiworkThanks!Thanks!IMO ""the rich are lazy"" is:\s\s1) True\s\s2) Central to the socialist ethos\s\s3) An electoral goldmineOne of the most baffling things I thought was normal in high school was the military regularly having a recruiting table in the lobby during lunch periods. Literally no other college or employer was allowed to do this at the school but totally cool for a marine to be hanging out just cracking jokes with kids.Exactly. It’s corrupt for a potential employer to set up in the lunch room so students can gauge interest yet it’s fine to ask them to sacrifice themselves for oil.Does that include JROTC programs?  I hope so.YES. Fuck this abhorrent practice of luring in children to fight oligarchs' wars.Whenever I see anyone talking to a recruiter I point out to them that having that conversation automatically increases their chances of drug addiction homelessness and suicide.Only issue I see is the countless wars America is in aside from that the military has hundreds of fields and trades to teach people plus’s benefitsThey shouldn’t be in schools. Period.If anything times haven’t changed in 2000 years Jesus was arrested and executed for being a radical and protested against religious hypocrisyBut at least though not for the right reasons he is hopefully not voting Nerra Tanden in. Ghouls are right twice a day I guess.Don't forget about Justice Rapey Kegstand who Manchin voted to confirm to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.Who is the Native woman AOC is talking about?Deb HaalandLet’s not kid ourselves. He’s not really a democrat...No he really is a Democrat. We are not the Democratic Democrats of America here. The Democrat Party is the enemy.Can someone please explain to me why the dsa  crowd is cheering on neera tanden? Whose job was to be a Clinton flunky who shits on progressives especially Bernie on the daily? Oh that's right you guys don't care about class only race now$4.7 billion a day.\s\s$32 billion a week.\s\s$141 billion a month.\s\s$845 billion over 6 months.\s\sThat's how much 643 billionaires in America made during the pandemic while 30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat. Yes. It's time for austerity for the billionaire class.\s\s***\s\sposted by [@SenSanders](https://twitter.com/SenSanders)\s\s^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's new)](https://github.com/username)The problem is establishment Democrats are only interested in maintaining power and fundraising. Policy is a very distant secondary concern and they only seem to be interested in doing the bare minimum to trick people into keeping them in office. They are not interested in positive change in any meaningful sense.Well said. Damn shame so many Democratic voter seem completely unaware of that. Actually and you're liable to be called a conspiracy theorist Trump support and or  accused of spreading Russian disinformation by these voters (!) for saying such things.Did you mean maintaining power within the Democrat Party itself? Because they seem pretty uninterested in maintaining power outside it.What do you all think of the possibility that M4A will eventually pass?0% chance without a militant and organized grass roots movement. I would tend to doubt the sobriety of any other assessment.Which GND co sponsor lost?"
