Is that what she wants?not sure but thats a good question to ask first.Freedom brings security and safetyWell saidSo when are we getting our freedom?It's so weird how the USLeft and USRight switched places in the late to mid-2000s. If we hop in a time machine and go back 18 years we'd have these same exact groups furiously fighting for the exact opposite stance.Yes!And go back further they switch again.

I mean put a dog mask on them and it's guaranteed to work.Eliminating freedoms for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù creates a dangerous precedent in which the government can become increasingly oppressive in the name of safety wait a sec oh shit it has already been happening for a while oh god oh fuck aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaTrueNot to be that guy but she forgot the question mark.Easy response. What's the opposite of freedom?sheepmodeerfWait. I know that freedom is but is ""freedom""?As my name directs you see that freedom is not something that can be given to another as a slave to a master but something higher. A state of consciousness to be earned that can overcome any physical situation even such a as slaveryDoes anyone else have a specific voice that you hear this guy's voice in?Yes.Ya know the voice that says ‚Äú I am from ancient greece ‚Äú \syeahhhhhhh that one.Putting freedom in scare quotes but not safety.Muh gubment safety üòÇBut without goobermint...\s\s**w h o w i l l b u i l d m u h r o a d s ? !**Absolutely and unequivocally yes.same!Seeing these anti gun college kids makes me ashamed that I‚Äôm going to be one soonyou're going to be an anti gun college kid?This is exactly how dictatorships start.Without freedom you are not safe from the governmentDon‚Äôt wear your seatbelthuuurrrr ddduuuurrrr don't use your brain.Freedom is like air you cannot live without itMe: True!!!!

One would have to be aware of the current reality to get it but safety here means regulations that have more consequences than just safetyPretty bold of you to assume you have freedomDo you have a link to me assuming I dont remember?*ahem* Freedom comes with responsibilityThat's fucker doesnt look responsible to you?!?!?everyone around you has the freedom to not dieLol!! Ok typhoid JoeEnjoy getting covid.huuuurrrrr ddduuuurrrrrI see. Let's abolish traffic laws. Just allow drunk driving and no speedlimits.your brain broke today?Hell yeah brother! Let's legalize rape while we're at it. That would be kinda based nglfreedom doesn't mean being able to rape people dumbass. you 12?i'm pretty sure killing other people is the opposite of voluntarywell 91% got it.  You should spend a minute and wonder where your thought process went askew.\sDo you think all 91% thought ""oh good I can kill people now""?Safety without freedom is slavery.So my freedom to murder you is more important than your safety? im playing the devils advocate don‚Äôt banYou still have the freedom to do that you just suffer the punishments of murder.commonsense must underline everything. We assume no one wants the bad karma.Yes.\s\sBut don't forget that I also have the freedom to murder you. And so do all of my friends. Plus people think people who kill people are jerks.

True Capitalism has never been tried. \s\s-Albert Fairfax IIThat‚Äôs the only way it can succeed though...I agree but this government-coerced shutdown is not something for which the free market could have done anything to prepare.\s\sThat is the 2008 bailout was BS imho (""too big to fail"" should not be a thing) but the recent $2TN aid package is not so much a bailout as it is compensation for damages caused directly by the government's actions.\s\sThink of it this way: if the government drove a truck through a wall into the lobby of your business (making it impossible for you to do any business) it's fair that they compensate you for those damages right? This aid package is pretty much the same thing.It‚Äôs fair but it isn‚Äôt in any way representative of what they would do. They‚Äôd try to intimidate you into fixing it yourself they‚Äôd then threaten you to do so. If that failed you could take them to court; good[ luck](https://www.google.com/amp/s/reason.com/2019/10/31/federal-court-rules-there-is-no-taking-if-the-police-destroy-an-innocent-persons-house-during-a-law-enforcement-operation/%3famp).Not the best analogy since the government didn‚Äôt produce anything to make this money. It‚Äôs being printed/taxed. \s\sI think it‚Äôs weird how Trump was so eager about an income tax deduction and brought it up several times but we ended up just getting a check instead.So you're saying its a correction of a market failure?>compensation for damages caused directly by the government's actions\s\sThe government didn't directly cause any damages. It was incompetent in the preventing of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but according to your beliefs shouldn't the free market be perfectly capable of handling it?So free market isn't the best option for handling problems? Hmm doesn't sound like that good a system. Seems good on paper but it just wouldnt hold upWhat happens in your ideal society without bail outs in a time like this or a depression? When most business collapse? \s\s*sincere question*Businesses with bad plans fail. They are allowed to fail. Their assets will likely be sold off to a competitor or to someone with more business sense buying assets cheaply in a failing market.Nobody forces the businesses to shut down so they'd have that but if they still can't survive that means they had a bad plan and should fail.It would collapse like the house of cards that it is.No true capitalist is a fallacyAin't y'all the same folks who say ""no true communism"" is a logical fallacy?Who‚Äôs the latter? Looks like an old man with a blonde wigIt‚Äôs Madonna.There are no bailouts in real that is laissez-fair capitalism.  The kind with bailouts is economically speaking fascism.Hoover tried it both left and right hated him.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real capitalism‚Äù\s\sYou guys sound like commiesNo true capitalism. \s\sNow you people sound like the commies who say ""not real communism"".This ignores the reason why the *""not real communism""* argument is stupid in the first place. Sure no society ever reached Marx's utopian stateless society so in that sense it would be correct to say that it's not real communism but it's still a bad argument to make in the first place since every single one that tried to has led to disaster and countless atrocities.\s\s No ""capitalist"" society today was ever intended to form a libertarian free market society meanwhile every instance of ""not real communism"" was intended to reach the goal of a fully socialist society. Not to mention that ""almost capitalism"" has been infinitely better than ""almost Communism"".\s\sThis is also a definitional issue libertarians and socialists use different definitions of capitalism.Let‚Äôs be real; the USSR was state-capitalism. By definition they weren‚Äôt socialist since the workers didn‚Äôt own the means of production.Just like the Soviet Union wasn‚Äôt communism because the workers didn‚Äôt own the means of production. As much as I despise horseshoe theory this sounds almost identical to what tankies parrot about true communism never having been tried.In that case\s\sReal communism/socialism hasn't been triedOh my lort. Baby the world doesn't work in absolutes. No communist country has ever existed if you're going by the textbook definition of Marxism. That doesn't mean that North Korea doesn't exist.basedCapitalism isn't voluntary.It has to be.Then it‚Äôs not capitalism.It should beIt never is and by definition cannot be voluntary.Join our partners! : r/fragilecommunism r/VoluntaristArt r/Voluntarism\s\s\sJoin our Discord!  : https://discord.gg/v49azVM3Na\s\s\sJoin our Telegram!  : https://t.me/volmemes\s\s\sReport leftist trolls if you come across them in the comments!

Drop this dumb meme.(((they))) did.Unpopular opinion: I don't think epstein even died. The body they brought out didn't even have the same nose or sideprofileYou‚Äôre not alone.\s\sI mean just think about it. You don‚Äôt become a billionaire by being stupid so Epstein has to be of at least average intelligence; probably above-average.\s\sGiven that he is of at least average intelligence wouldn‚Äôt you expect him to have set up a ‚Äúdead man‚Äôs trigger‚Äù system for his own security?\s\sYou know what I mean: he‚Äôs almost certainly got some kind of arrangement where he pays somebody to hold on to a bunch of evidence on high-level officials and to release that evidence to the public if any harm comes to Epstein.\s\sA guy like him would absolutely need such a system in order to have security you know? And when you‚Äôre in bed with the Clintons (and other major power players) you need all the security you can get.\s\sSo if Epstein did have a dead man‚Äôs trigger system then the fact that no evidence dump occurred means that Epstein is still alive.\s\sOf course this is just speculation; I don‚Äôt think we will ever know for sure what has become of him.He‚Äôs on his private island with 15 hookersRegardless someone needs to make the elites pay for what they're doingPanama papersWhat's in the panama papers? isn't that like banking stuff? sry not very familiarWell just like this meme wtf are we supposed to do lol.\s\sLike what corrupt officials are we supposed to bring to justice?

Oh no! What a threat to the country I must be!Capital rioters during the protest versus afterRioting because black people are being disproportionately killed by an institution meant to protect them vs storming the fucking capitol cuz the wrong senile old man was elected is 100 percent the same.Killing innocents destroying livelihoods and private businesses while setting cities on fire and barely touching the police you're allegedly protesting against sure is very different than invading a government building.[deleted]Both are manufactured so yes absolutely the sameAccording to BLM the issue is the government.

People don't understand this and then blame free market economics. If your degree turns out to be worthless and you can't really make ends meet guess what those bills are still coming to your mailbox.\s\sBut I do have to ask why can't you declare bankruptcy with student loans in the great Red Blue and White when you can with other types of loans?The government wants their money back.Mainly because banks don‚Äôt give out these loans anymore. Almost all are federal loans given out by Uncle Sam. Your credit rating isn‚Äôt something that the US govt can discriminate on (because your credit score definitely isn‚Äôt something that reliably shows how likely you are to default on a loan). It also can‚Äôt discriminate on degree type (otherwise gender/racial studies degrees wouldn‚Äôt be viable for loans) making the whole system highly over regulated complicated and one that ultimately screws the consumer to give the appearance of ‚Äúfairness.‚ÄùThe problem is more that the government should NEVER be in the business of guaranteeing loans. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving prices up. And yeah the kids are irresponsible but for every irresponsible kid there‚Äôs an irresponsible parent who told them it was a good idea.ThEy'Ve GoT a MoNopOly oN edUCaTiOnBecause lenders are a vulnerable minority group. They make up such a small percentage of the population. We need to protect the lenders financially to make up for past injustices to their people.Because that's the only way to make it a ""Guaranteed"" student loan.\s\sWe guarantee the loan if you guarantee the payback.That‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with the system. No matter what I decide to study I think it should guarantee me enough money so I can live in Greenwich village and eat out at tapas places 3 times a week.This is the fault of capitalism. I majored in English and my superior understanding of literature has societal value that should equal a comfortable life in a place free of non-elite-academics like myself> But I do have to ask why can't you declare bankruptcy with student loans in the great Red Blue and White when you can with other types of loans?\s\sIf you could do this then many people would declare bankruptcy immediately after college when they are young as they have effectively zero assets. The negative credit effects only last for 7 or 10 years (depending on the type of bankruptcy) so if you were willing to wait until your early 30s to think about getting a loan for something else like a house it would make sense to discharge the loans via bankruptcy rather than pay them back. For many people particularly in big cities a bad credit rating when you're in your 20s doesn't matter because you are not likely to be able to afford a house in any case.\s\sObviously if this happened loan providers would stop offering loans. The US college funding system needs reform but there is a reason why student loans can't be discharged through bankruptcy.Ah yes ObamacareAnd the ones paying in full get fucked. I really hate loanersOn top of that you can't declare banktuptcy.The Government is a great reliable source of money. Business models which take money from the Government are popular as a result.\s\sIn this situation the customer is a tool used to extract money from the government. The product being sold to the customer is a token often with little to know real value.\s\sThe college gets money from the Government when the student pays the tuition with money they got from the Government. The student is the tool used to facilitate that transfer because the student has to be the one who takes out the loan. The degree being purchased has very little genuine value.\s\sHeck I do something very similar. In one of my areas of practice the client is a tool used to extract money from the Government. The product that I'm selling the client is definitely not worth what the Government pays.Join our partners! : r/fragilecommunism r/VoluntaristArt r/Voluntarism\s\s\sJoin our Discord!  : https://discord.com/invite/NdBx9taU6h\s\s\sJoin our Telegram!  : https://t.me/volmemes\s\s\sReport leftist trolls if you come across them in the comments!

Do you think we expend the same amount of labor to feed ourselves as our ancient ancestors? Do you think this trend will continue towards more efficiency or less? The labor it takes to keep the human race alive is rapidly decreasing as our technological advancement increases. Automation is clearly where we are headed as a civilization. We already currently produce enough food to feed the entire global population and then some. The only thing preventing the necessities of all humans from being met is inefficiency and pointless redtape like the idea you absolutely *must* work 40 hours a week or you don't deserve to live. How much work was deemed non-essential during this pandemic? A significant portion of the population. This would seem to indicate that at present there are not enough jobs essential to meeting human necessities to employ everyone. A lot of the work we do is actually superfluous. What happens when many jobs are automated away? Do all those people just not deserve to live anymore because our efficiency has reached a point where there is no reason for them to go to work? All of this is subject to change. You have to realize that. Saying things absolutely must continue the way they are set up now is like serfs in the 19th century saying there is absolutely no other possible system serfdom will continue forever. There is no reason to believe we should remain the way we are indefinitely and mankind should not advance the way we always have.

Would that make it not a state or statelike entity? Is all that matters the scale?>So if we presumed the state owned all the property in a given country would that make it not theft?\s\sYes but why would anyone presume that? Do we also presume that regular mafias own the businesses they exploit?How about bothYou can't because it's both. You're being paid unfairly for your profit produced and the state's taking a portion under the guise of general upkeep while lining the pockets of their elite friends.\s\sIt's current cheaper for ford* to keep people employed to outcompete the companies who are going under even if it risks cross county contamination and the state lets this happen to maintain the economy.\s\sThe real problem is gluttonous individuals who value profit over economic quality of life.Thats a weak argument. \s\sYour labor generates X value. You get paid Y value. Where Y < X. You dont benefit from the difference and it can be viewed as an alternative form of 'tax'. That 'tax' could be spent on things you oppose or dont benefit from.(increased bonuses for bosses donations to organizations you disagree with). \s\sOr from another angle. The state does pay for things that you benefit from even if you oppose it. Theres the normal arguement for roads and libraries im sure youve heard of a million times. But even general well being of the community. DMV(as bad as its implemented it is a necessary thing). Police and fire departments. Courts. Enforcement of regulations that keep the air water and food you consume sustainable.But most employers use their assets to allow X to make money efficiently.  If you can afford drive a taxi with your own car insurance gas and you keep all that money.  If you are employed you are using someone else‚Äôs assets to generate that revenue hence why you get a portion of revenue for payment2-4% of federal taxation goes to things like ‚Äúroads‚Äù or other ancillary shit like the EPA or the foundation for the sciences and arts. \s\sThe rest of federal taxation goes to a giant Ponzi scheme (SS) and the military industrial complex besides all the money being printed by the FED. \s\sWhat a time to be alive.How do you determine X?Why are you entitled to X?Yes I produce more than I get paid at my job but they provide me with resources and opportunities that add more value to my time than I could make working alone. It‚Äôs a voluntary transaction my transactions with the state are not.I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre taking into account the time and financial investment of the business owners and others upstream from you in the organization that make the value your labor creates possible.  \s\sOn your second angle you focus on the basic government functions that account for a minuscule portion of total government spending. Your examples are also all things best administered by your local government that can tailor the programs to each communities disparate needs. The main issue is all of the (majority of) spending government especially federal government partakes in that has a debatable benefit. The money is much more efficiently directed and better represents the public‚Äôs priorities if it can be allocated by those who earn it.Value is subjective just because a chair is sold for $10 doesn't mean that its inherent value is $10 and therefore the chair maker is entitled to $10.How can you say this post makes a weak argument and then proceed to make the BS labor theory of value argument that no credible economist takes seriously?\s\sYes labor does create some value but value itself is not only derived from labor.How are police departments beneficial?Shouldn‚Äôt you guys be out protesting the lock down and trying to lynch people who don‚Äôt look like you right now?

I got that feeling you get when you show up to your own birthday party and all you find is your family.Tax the politicians!!The government monitors our spending yet they‚Äôre trillions in debt.  They restrict how we own weapons yet they‚Äôre the ones killing millions.  They tell us what drugs we can use yet they fund the cartels.Who‚Äôs worth 100 million?Pelosi is worth 250 million last I read. Not sure how accurate that isMitch McConnellTime to get rid of cash. The government should issue electronic cash. That way they can track every cent.They're working on it. Give them time.Can someone tell me what's insider tradingFrom Wikipedia:\s\s> Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) based on material nonpublic information about the company. \s\sIt's been in the news lately that Fed officials have been doing insider trades and that Pelosi's husband has likely been doing it as well.  These people have knowledge that very few people do and they use that to play the stock market ahead of the trends so that their wealth quickly multiplies instead of going up AND down like the rest of us suffer with the stock market.This is an attack on our democracy. CNN told me so.I love how I know who they‚Äôre referring to without even saying their name.Hallelujah brotherCongress investigated that and found that Congress isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong.You mean like ending capitalism?

After the end of ww2 the government just kept the ban in place. Now we have socialist politicians (actual socialist not american ""socialist"") who also want to ban hunting and sport rifles... We're getting cucked really hardAnd this is why you see Americans hold onto their 2A rights like rabid dogs. Once you give the government an inch they immediately start going after that next inch until you have none left to giveThat sucks.  Socialism is a parasiteWhat's the law? I wanted to find it but all I can find is ""WE SHOULD BE LIKE FRANCE""Here in spain we also are pretty fucked up with guns and stuff but even if you own one theres an ammendment/law that prohibits the use of inecual firce or something like that bassically if someone breaks in your house with a knife you cant use a gun AND even if you had a weapon of the same ""power"" you would have to wait till he hits you first to be allowed to attack him\s\sEdit: sorry for bad english as you can tell im not native speaker\s\sEdit 2: the answers describe pretty much our current situation with the socialist politicians tbhYou should do what you french do bestMARX IS ROLLING IN HIS FUCKING GRAVE AT WHAT YOU DESCRIBEDIf they were true socialists they would be super pro gun.[deleted]Dude move here & help us keep the second amendment.Socialist as in ""capital and means of production are social owned""?

And the Lord did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chulapas. And the Lord spake saying 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three no more no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count neither count thou two excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.

How many Twitter Accounts did Jesus have? \sBetter have the government ban all Twitter accounts then. How many showers did Jesus have?

I guess exploiting his survival through a school shooting is more profitableDamn.......it was super effective.Funny how the gun is blamed for that horrific shooting instead of the FBI and local police.  FBI had been tipped off on the kid dozens of times and the police had been called just as many.  They knew the situation and were even warned by his own mouth of what he had planned.  But yep trust the government to protect you...Well he would have made way less victims if he had to use a kitchen knife.Personally I think not using your super powers to not be crucified is the same as suicide by not taking action. Like not stepping out from in front of a bus. Otherwise I agree.Well it technically was. He was meant to die for our sins. Still think a cleansing would have worked betterI guess I always assumed jesus would be more of a Long Range Rifle type of guy. M107 ghillie suit Jesus. Oh and his crosshairs are... You get it.I always picture him as more of levergun and wheeliegat wielding western gunslinger type. Poncho cowboy hat cigarillo and all.It bugs me so much when leftists are like well yeah Jesus said feed the poor. and then go in to explain how Jesus would have wanted the government that killed hi. To redistribute the wealth to the poorI'm sure Jesus Christ would've *wanted* the Roman Empire to redistribute their wealth so that more poor people were taken care of but wants aren't necessarily realitySomething something give to Caesar what is caesars....No ""leftist"" (also if you're in America leftists don't really exist) wants the Roman style of filing. And those same leftists would agree with the Jesus statement to feed/give money to the poor. \s\sHow exactly are the average individual going to help the poor if they don't have some form of vehicle for distribution and logistics?It bugs me that people like you are so damn ignorant. \s\s""Servants be obedient to them that are¬†your¬†masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ;""\s\s""And Jesus answering said unto them Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.""\s\sJesus wanted you to pay your fucking taxes. He also wanted you to give away all your possession.

This is why I carry so when someone who is carrying a gun tries to kill me and I make him perish with his gun.Modern interpretation of what Jesus meant:  ***""Don't bring a knife to a gun fight.""***Your terms are acceptable.Exactly the disciples were strappedBeats wasting away in a hospital.Nobody wants to quote Ezekiel 25:17?Or Luke 22:36None but he did tell us to buy a sword.Time for a fucking crusadeWould Jesus prefer a cloak or a sword?Pilate found him innocent and turned him over to the Jews no?The government of Judea. It was a different system but think if it like if the feds said you didn‚Äôt violate federal law but handed you to the state government for violating state law and you were then executed. Still killed by the government.The flag in his pic is hung backwards right?Yea? Thats not disrespectful.I mean it was all part of his overall plan (I am a Christian) but he was all for people owning whatever to defend themselves. This guy is a fucking idiot who has obviously never read the Bible and is using my lord and savior as an excuse to push his agenda and that‚Äôs gayLuke 22:36 Jesus tells the Disciples to sell their cloaks and buy swords if they don't already have them. Swords then equal AR-15 now.He realizes a good portion of libertarians are atheists/agnostics right?Are they?I‚Äôm Catholic but I suck at itNot I.I dont think he made this for the libertarian crowd. It sounds more like theyre intentionally misreading the message because his presence triggers them.Oh; the ""David Hogg"" who got into Harvard with a 1270 SAT?\s\sI always thought that stunk to high heaven. Look at his [subsequent tweets](https://archive.vn/ycdhP); he writes like a strung-out high schooler. ""hist"" ""boarder""?\s\sHogg is a plant. Maybe even a Manchurian Candidate. Consider this:\s\sDavid Hogg will be unliked by his peers for being a controlling fascist wannabe. They'll dislike being in class with him because he'll be an exceptional brown-noser and will stir the pot by making everything a social justice issue. He'll have poor grades because he's just not that smart.\s\sPoor grades loner social outcast. Throw in some 'depression meds' and you have a future school shooting. Only the timing is in question but you can bet it'll be at an 'effective' moment.Damn dude. I think you just killed him ü§£ü§£ü§£He was also 100% on board with being murdered saw it coming and allowed it to happen. This is kinda literally the main point of Christianity Jesus‚Äôs sacrifice not ‚ÄúJesus got caught slipping by the gov and was killed‚Äù. This is an all around dumb exchangeThe exchange is Hogg's defense against guns is jesus didnt have any AR-15s.......\s\sThough there were no AR-15's during his time......\s\sThere wasnt even flintlock arms.....\s\sDon't ride the joke so hard. Its not a dickBOOM!Lol that was funnySo defund the police.He went to his death willingly...Yeah the Government didn‚Äôt really want to do it it was the people that wanted it lol.‚ÄúJesus would vote Biden/Harris‚ÄùNot a fan of guns but he walked himself right into that one.Well missing the point but he did say for the apostles to stay strapped.Careful last time Hogg had shots fired at him we got \s\sWell \s\sDavid HoggThis guy‚Äôs starting to get old enough that being a kid isn‚Äôt an excuse for saying dumb shit like this anymore.Doesn't he make a whole point about not wanting to stop them because it was supposed to teach the humans a lesson in how misguided they were as well as him showing the ultimate forgiveness/humility?\s\sLater additions to the Bible also keep highlighting that the jews were bad for betraying Jesus while originally the Bible was only meant as anti-Roman propaganda once priests started splitting Christianity off into its own religion they wanted to create distance between them and Judaism and then meant antagonizing the jews for no reasons with retcon to the Jesus story. He was popular with the people for essentially being an anarchist rebel against the Roman's in a peaceful way then they flip it to everyone hating him when he gets executed except the ""true believers"" ofc.This is actually softly false. The Bible isn‚Äôt ‚Äúanti-Roman‚Äù propaganda. It states listen to the government unless they go against Gods law. \s\sOn top of that Christianity stemmed from the (now heretical) theology of the Two Powers in Heaven which mimics the theological aspect ( an invisible God and a visible God interacting with the Earth) of the same people in Egypt Canaan and other places.What a ridiculous line of reasoning its like asking how many vaccines jesus got or somethingHe said to them ""But now if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.\s\sLuke 22:36I always wonder what kind of crappy sword you get for selling your cloak.Was it illegal for Jesus to own an AR15?Jesus didn't own anything. He had no need to protect himself as God protected him and he was God. Remind me how many people did Jesus Bully online for not sharing his views? How many people did Jesus shame for wanting to protect their families? That's right. Zero. Moving on.[deleted][deleted]Nailed it!Left wingers should save the ‚ÄúI know what Jesus wanted‚Äù analogies and just come out and say what they really mean which is ‚ÄúI hate you your religion and your culture because you don‚Äôt vote how I want you to‚Äù.

Did Judas betray Jesus if he was intended to be a lamb for slaughter?

He even asked that 'this cup be taken from his lips' but refused to use his own magic or whatever to stop things from happening.

Or is your made up religion to hard to keep straight like your made up values.Tbf neither of these tweets really works considering that Jesus willingly let himself be killed...Didn't someone use a sword to defend Him from being lawfully arrested and Jesus healed the ear and chastised the violent defensive action?Less for defending Jesus. Jesus had to die to save those who follow him. Thus it was really for unknowingly trying to keep Jesus from fulfilling his purpose. Also that guy had other stuff to do besides get clapped by the Pharisees.But God wanted him to die.He had the holy hand grenade..Did Hogg really say that? Holy crap. 9-volt brain.Unironic answer to the question ""how many weapons did Jesus own?"": none he was a pacifist\s\sAlthough half of his disciples carried swords every dayLOLHe spelled jews wrong.Bruh who crucified Jesus?Jesus was chill with his desciples being armed good example was when peter cut off the earYou-\s\sYou realize Jesus went to the cross willingly and peacefully to die for the sins of humanity right? I don‚Äôt mind you guys arguing for second amendment rights but come one man at least quote the Bible right.Why would Jesus need an AR-15?

Lol.If the government wants to murder you a gun ain't gonna save you.I though Jesus sacrificed himself ? Didn't he ?Haha what kind of idiot thinks owning a gun will protect you from your government? If anything they'll shove their boot further up your ass.Jesus also healed the ear of the Roman soldier that Peter chopped off defending him but go off.  \s\sI'm so embarrassed that I used to think of myself as a libertarian.Okay I mean I can't stand the kid and more than the rest of you guys and the tweet is stupid but I think we are ignoring the point. I think Hogg is saying Jesus wouldn't have owned a gun if they were around back then because he believed in and loved people around him more than his desire to protect himself. Obviously I disagree that this means I shouldn't be able to defend myself just because Jesus wouldn't but the tweet is moreso saying it's odd to use christianity as justification to be pro gun and I agree. There are much stronger arguments to be pro 2ADon‚Äôt think Jesus ever advocated for murder. Man this thread is fucking stupid...Y‚Äôall Qaeda is the worst.There is no number of AR-15s big enough to stop the government from murdering you if it wants to. It has drones you are not important.That's what you get for advocating people pay taxesHe wasn't murdered by the government he was murdered by his peersPsalm 82:4 ‚ÄúRescue weak and needy people. Help them escape the power of wicked people.‚Äù\s\sHow? Prayer reading the word charity and yes also weapons\s\sLuke 22:36 ‚ÄúHe said to them ""But now if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.‚ÄùHe literally had armed followers ready to protect him from the govenment who he told to stand down. Not to mention being 'murdered' was part of the damn plan. Read your own stupid book.  \s\s\sLuke 22\s\s49 When the other disciples saw what was about to happen they exclaimed ‚ÄúLord should we fight? We brought the swords!‚Äù **50**¬†And one of them struck at the high priest‚Äôs slave slashing off his right ear.\s\s**51**¬†But Jesus said ‚ÄúNo more of this.‚Äù And he touched the man‚Äôs ear and healed him.What about Iraq and Syria? Enough for every family member in every house. Tyranny and government murder still prevalent. You kids are funny to think that guns will protect you.Jesus chose to die.God damn üëÄThat‚Äôs like asking what type of iPhone dinosaurs usedSo if he‚Äôd had a gun...he‚Äôd have been totally fine?So you guys actually would support a cult to fight the military with an ARsI'm genuinely sympathetic to this kid's trauma he endured but he consistently says the dumbest things and the media pretended he's an expert on everything.If he wasn‚Äôt murdered by is government he wouldn‚Äôt have died for your sins. \s\sThat means you‚Äôd go to hell if JC had sufficient AR15s...Pretty sure Luke 22:36 addresses this.Wasn‚Äôt Jesus‚Äôs downfall a result of betrayal from within his own group? Like he was doing well for a while *at least.*In some faiths he inherits the earth and all that is on it/is literally god so owns everything on it so uhh...all of them?I think y‚Äôall missed the point about JesusWhat did he care he rose from the dead.John 18:10-11\s\s10¬†Then Simon Peter who had a sword drew it and struck the high priest‚Äôs servant cutting off his right ear. (The servant‚Äôs name was Malchus.)\s11¬†Jesus commanded Peter¬†‚ÄúPut your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup¬†the Father has given me?‚Äù\s\sHe had arms but refused to use them.Until he raised them up and said it is finished.\s\sJoking aside you are correct.TBF his governor tried to set him free.  It was religious zealots who brought him in on trumped up charges and incited the crowd to yell ""crucify him!""Jesus never would have been crucified if he had had a gun.  Brilliant.  And where would Christians be without that sacrifice?hot take: jesus would've died all the same no matter how many ARs he hadAlso Jesus knew what was going to happen to him and give in willinglyThe answer is as dumb as the question though...Does David Hogg not realize that like 90% of the Old Testament is about war?Where was the ‚Äúgood guy with a crucifix‚Äù to save him?That guys flag is backwards on the wall.So Jesus dies in a shootout with the government in that version?The people killed Him not the governmentHey another thing that doesn't exist people use to justify gun ownership.I don‚Äôt need to justify all my guns. I buy what I want.Not really a great argument when your government has weapons like tanks missiles and drones. No gun on the market is going to protect you from our government.Although I don't think this will ever happen but hypothetically if the Government turned tyrannical there would be mass defections from the military including each States National Guard. An armed populace is just a small deterrent and another headache they'd have to deal with.He was murdered by his own people. The Roman governor washed his hands of the matter. It it was still his own Government. A Theocracy is still a Government.That's like someone over 2000 years in the future saying ""remind me how many computer automated brains Elon Musk had to send a rocket to Mars""As if a person with a rifle could defend themselves from the goverment you're just one.He was Israeli probably more of an uzi guy.David Hogg üòÇüòÇJesus didn't live in romeHe went willingly bro.Beautiful.\s\sThe ENTIRE lesson Jesus sacrificed his life on the cross to show humanity was that it's totally AOK to give your life passively resisting violence and fascism that the Son of God would not lower himself to violence even to defend his own life.\s\sAnd even though Jesus even asked Peter to put down his sword and stop resisting during his arrest this ""libertarian"" thinks he would have shot back if he had a gun.   SMH.Because the Roman Empire would always negotiate with armed uprisings and totally would never use overwhelming force to put down rebellions.Look how that worked out for the Romans in the long run.[deleted]The inspiring story of Rambo Jesus! So what if having a gun destroys the whole point of the story!Neither one of those guys understands why Jesus died but they sure seem headstrong about it.Well no... No shots were fired. That's the problem.Did you know there are other ways to avoid being killed by your government? Like maybe i dunno electing people who won‚Äôt harm you?Yeah probably would‚Äôve done him some good.While debated ad nauseum the tiny snips of Jesus's words regarding violence are pretty basic. If smitten turn the other cheek a sword is a higher priority than a cloak and some swords is enough swords.This is completely off the mark. Even if available Jesus would not have used weapons which is the point.False. Jesus him self commanded his followers to get a sword. And if they could not  afford a sword to sell their coat and buy one. \s\sLuke 22:36-38‚ÄúHey did the cops catch that guy?‚Äù ‚ÄúNah he had enough guns to stop them‚Äù said no one ever.That's because Jesus knew fighting against the Roman government itself would solve nothing. Another oppressive force would just take its place. Instead he decided to sacrifice himself to rid the evil that causes oppressive nations like the Roman empire to form.Murdered is a weird word to use here. \s\s‚ÄúHmmm how shall I save mankind from their sins. Aha. I know. I‚Äôll impregnate a married woman have her give birth to my son who is also me and then I will have myself/ my son crucified. But here‚Äôs the real kicker I/ he will raise from the dead 3 days later.‚Äù \s\s‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù\s\s‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry. Decades later I‚Äôll have some people who weren‚Äôt there write this stuff down based on stories they‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôm also tossing around the idea that perhaps I won‚Äôt preserve these manuscripts but I‚Äôm sure in the future people will be able to piece together the scraps that they find and translate from dead languages. I have spoken‚ÄùYeah Jesus seemed like peaceful guy who wouldn‚Äôt have gone down guns blazing.But he broke the lawWasn't jesus all for peace?Jesus wasn‚Äôt killed by his government. He was killed by people who ‚Äúpracticed‚Äù his religion.Wasn't the whole thing a plan by his dad though?Jesus/God has killed Millions more than the AR ever will.Had Jesus not been murdered by his government then our sins would not have been forgiven. I'm confused whole reason he came down was to die at the hands of man.Humm Jesus choose not to fight. That was pretty much the whole point.Said as if any militia could ever possibly be formed to stand against any part of the US military. Gun-strokers: ""We've got thousands of men with assault rifles!"" \sUS: ""We've got an Air Force -_-.""Wasn‚Äôt the whole point of his existence to be sacrificed? To forgive the sins of man? Just gonna ignore the whole point of the moment to promote gun ownership?Don't be ridiculous \s\sWe all know Jesus carried a 1911 and an M1AHe had every single AR15 in the world.If he was alive today he probably wouldn't own an Ar-15 and if he did it would be reluctantly.A ""libertarian socialist?"" Jesus that is stupid.Can someone tell me how many times owning an AR-15 has stopped people being murdered by their government? I'd guess the number is incredibly low compared to how many people have been murdered specifically BECAUSE they own one.I get that you guys aren't educated or Christians but the whole point of Jesus was that he died for the sins of mankind.so. this misses the point of jesus‚Äô sacrifice. gang.No. But at the same time asking how many AR-15s jesus owned as an argument is like asking why cavemen didnt harness fossil fuels back then. Well probably cause that kind of technology wasnt available.\s\sAlso religion should have shit to do with gun ownership. Jesus didnt mix fabrics either but look at karen here with her silk blouse that had cotton lining.\sThats how inquisitions start and shit gets stupidThat escalated quickly!It was the pharisees and sadducees that put Christ on the cross. They were the Jewish religious leaders of that time. Cesser said he washed his hands of the verdict but put Jesus on the cross as to not stir a riot.\s\sEdit: Also if you think the Lord would use a gun to save Himself from the cross you don't know the Lord or why He did it.A lot of people don‚Äôt know this in one of the new testament books one of Jesus‚Äô apostles draws a sword when the Sanhedrin came to arrest him and cut off the ear of a Roman soldier. \s\sAnd Jesus stopped him told him to sheathe his sword and went with the authorities willingly.Actually gun nuts who go against the government quite often kill themselves. It‚Äôs the bombers who get shit doneI mean we are talking about a guy who in response to people selling things at the temple tied a bunch of cords into a cat-o'-nine-tails and started flogging people and flipping thier tables. \s\sI think he would be more of an auto shotgun with less than lethal loads kinda guyFuck David HoggWell Peter did cut a guy's ear off when they came to arrest Jesus. So at least his disciples were open carry.The come back from wolf was incredible.Defeats the entire purpose of jesus to not kill himThe point is if jesus still got merc'ed by the government.\s\sGod said Jesus would die.....Jesus just chose to piss the people in the temple off instead of combat or some other shit.>Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angel\s\sThis is such a dumb argument. Jesus had no need for guns and wouldn't have used them if he had them.So the AR 15s would  subvert God's will?\s\sI'm confused....If it‚Äôs gods will for people to be murdered mugged or worse then sureI totally forgot reading about the guy who just killed all of the policemen so they left him alone.[removed]Better than just getting murderedThis is some terrible logicSo is my existence but apparently some still support thatDamn good point. Time to travel with a case of AR-15s and a ton of roundsMan you guys misunderstood the Bible and his tweet...\s\sAlso. Say it was modern times and Jesus had 100 AR15s and the government broke down his door and was like ""you're going straight to guantamano bay"" do you think he'd be able to just mow down some feds and he'd be off scot free? \s\sDavid Hogg who is a 18 years old when he made this tweet and has lived through his class mates being murdered by gun violence (so thats a good look guys epic logic win) and yet I still understand that his point is that Jesus was peace loving and promoted nonviolence so for a Christian fundamentalist to base their identity around owning guns and dreaming of getting to shoot someone with them is not very christ-like. \s\sIf you're not a Christian then this post doesn't apply to you so why are you responding to it?\s\sIf you can somehow argue with me that it is logically consistent to preach the teachings of Jesus while also stockpiling guns then I'd love to have that chat but right now either you're arguing that Jesus was wrong or you think Jesus would absolutely have owned guns.HOLLY SHIT #OWNEDThank you David for using my religion to spread your fallacious agenda. Asshole.Forgot what kind of place this is‚Äúa few‚Äù AR-15s? You realize there are hundreds of millions of privately owned firearms in the US? Any demand on military to confiscate these or kill their fellow citizens would undoubtedly divide the military. You are talking about the most numerous and heavily armed militia group in history against a fractured version of our military (that still took years to defeat most of ISIS which at it‚Äôs peak barely had 100000 total members)....I think the part of this that irritates me is that everyone always ignores that if the government wants you dead our homes can be the target of a drone strike just as easily as anything else...I'm pretty sure that if firearms existed back then the Roman's would have has them too and would have just gunned him down in the streets. A better question would be ""how many swords and spears did Jesus have"" to which the answer would be zero because regardless of what kind of weapons technology existed in his day Jesus was all about kindness forgiveness and non violence. Shockingly guns are entirely antithetical to that philosophy and the man would be pissed that you'd try and use his life story as justification for using them.I was thinking the answer would be : just enough for him to be the good guy of the story become a martyr and still be revered 2000 years later. \sBasically what you are saying. \sAlso I'm not religious.Stupid cuck wouldn‚Äôt have done anything about it. He knew he was sent to die he predicted how and when it would happen he didn‚Äôt do anything about it and still acted surprised when he did eventually breathe his last.[deleted]No....but if several people have guns....we're golden. Half them fat and old fucks would probably forget the safety lmaoAlso the population jesus had to deal with at that time was probably a few thousand. If your only going after government officials maybe 100. MaybeWait. Is the response saying Jesus should‚Äôve used guns to defend himself? Do ppl in this sub not understand Jesus? \s\sThe point Hogg makes stands. Plenty who thump their chests at being Christian are the furthest from Christ.What......i think you're on a different page than the rest of usYou are 100% correct.It wasn't the govt though.Yes it was. The romans were the government.Of course an AR-15 wouldn't prevent you from being murdered by the American government.\s\sOf course no amount of AR-15's would. In reality your defensibility from the State is negatively correlated with how many AR-15's you own. By stockpiling arms you are effectively opting in to being surveilled more than any other American.\s\sThey can kill you and make it look like you had a traffic accident. There is nothing you can do.\s\sCivil defense or defense against the **United States Government** is hands down the worst popular argument for private ownership of guns.[removed]Look at Myanmar right now. Imagine if the population there had access to firearms.\s\sIf the government started mindlessly slaughtering everyone then sure no amount of AR-15s would work against that. But a tyrannical government doesn't seek to kill everyone it seeks to control everyone which means it won't exactly start firing drone strikes and nukes at everyone. It will seek to do what Myanmar is doing right now and suppress people and against a couple regular soldiers AR-15s can definitely work.Jesus used love and compassion as his weapon... you dumb bitch.Lot of good that did.Imagine thinking a few AR-15‚Äôs is stopping the government from killing you.An AR-15 would protect you from the Government. Right...Pretty sure you can own as many ar-15s as you like and it's not gonna do shit to stop the government from drone striking you into a fine red mist if they wantedTIL A semi auto that fires .22 caliber can protect me from government drones and tanks. Sounds legit.\s\sWhat's the matter honey? You forgot about reality when you were pretending you had a need for an AR  beyond just *wanting* one? I get it reality is tough sweetie. Do try to control your feelings. üò¨Yes owning 600000000 AR15‚Äôs can match up against drones tanks napalmExcept Jesus told the Apostles not to fight the Romans to let them take him. \s\sBecause you dumb fucks supposedly believe that his sacrifice on the cross redeemed mankind. It‚Äôs literally the basis of your religion. \s\sBut your real god is money toxic masculinity and Ayn Rand.You really showed all the Christians on this Christian subreddit.Yeah Jesus told them to go against their instincts because he had a mission of self-sacrifice not because he abhorred self-defense. \s\sLet me guess...you are your own god but your ideology just happens to line up with 95% of media and government nanny-state talking points? If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôll gladly apologize because I don‚Äôt want to come off like an angry asshole. Enough of that already in your comment.Bingo. Reading through the other comments is such a trip. Jesus promoting or condoning violence against anyone via antithesis to him. These people are a whole new level of stupid.Clearly not as many as the romans. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬ØHe should have complied.Isn't that Jesus the guy who said something like ""But now if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and if you don‚Äôt have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.""?That answer can apply to literally anyone though since you wouldn't be able to stop the best funded military in the worldTrue but tell active duty to fire on todays citizens and that official or officer is get wreckedRice farmers and goat herders disagreeThat would hold more water if the story wasn't ya know made up.The government didn't kill Jesus god did.No he told jesus that he had to die. Jesus just thought pissing them off was the quickest wayIt could also be argued that the government didn‚Äôt kill him but carried out the wishes of the people who wanted Jesus crucified. Jesus was found to not be at fault but when everyone wanted him dead ol PP washed his hands of it.But I fix helicopters üòî**Without Pay** just like everyone else who ‚Äúflattened the curve‚ÄùCan we make that 2 weeks turn into 2 years as well?BUT WHO WILL BUILD OUR PRISTINE ROADS ISABELLAI'm a government employee and I felt this.

For the US. A big militairy is necessary. For most european countries a military can also be small to non existent.Freedom of association only extends to people I agree with silly. If everyone had freedoms even if they disagreed with me who would I oppress?Start with me. I dare you.Of course that's why it's ""freedom of association"" and not ""obligation of association"". Because I can choose who to associate with!I‚Äôm sorry but what is this in reference to? Is it the gay guys who wanted a wedding cake?People get really angry about gay guys wanting cake[deleted]I heard a great counter to that whole thing on Twitter. The reason libertarianism is important to not force a person or business to provide a service to another - like requiring by law that a bigot baker make a gay cake - is because you'd then be forcing a black baker to bake a KKK cake. \s\sPeople forget about liberties when it suits them.\s\s#VoteGoldi still don‚Äôt understand why a gay couple would want to buy a cake from a company that doesn‚Äôt support their right to marry. so stupid to me. like who cares if they don‚Äôt give you cake. just go on yelp and tell everyone they‚Äôre anti lgbt and they‚Äôll get what‚Äôs coming. the law doesn‚Äôt have to be involved with everything.For the lawsuit idiotExactly. This is how the free market is supposed to workBecause some people want to compel others to behave the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way. They know not what they ask of their government. They assume these powers will only be used for ‚Äúgood.‚ÄùGet what is coming? I hope you're being sarcasticThis is the jump leftists don‚Äôt want to make. Just like being against police unions also requires one to be against all public sector unions.I don‚Äôt know that this is the same jump. (At least I don‚Äôt think so)\sUnions create leverage. Leverage to a pipe fitter is better pay and more time off.\sLeverage to the militarized police is qualified immunity ever expanding fuzzy asset seizure/forfeiture etc.\sThis meme\sYes.\sUnions of steel workers v.\sUnions of people who carry guns and are allowed to kill us under ever expanding circumstances with no repercussions?\sMaybe not quite.Yooo this is my favorite comparison to make what are you talking about.[deleted]> This is the jump leftists don‚Äôt want to make\s\sShould ""refusal to wear a mask"" be determined to be a [biological trait solidified during prenatal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_and_sexual_orientation) rather than an entirely-voluntary state of being that costs a couple bucks to fix then sure we could call that a ""jump"".  I ain't exactly holding my breath for such a determination though.\s\s> Just like being against police unions also requires one to be against all public sector unions.\s\sLeftists (myself included) are against police unions in particular because they seem to consist predominantly of corrupt cops defending other corrupt cops (more so than even teachers' unions and that's saying something) and represent a profession that already has abundant power (through monopolized violence) over normal citizens.  That is: just because all individuals have the right to voluntarily associate with one another and collectively negotiate for better terms of employment doesn't mean those associations are always just or that they (and the members thereof) are beyond criticism¬π.\s\sFurther: even if I happen to oppose teachers' unions (in their current state) on similar grounds of rampant corruption at least parents/students have *some* opportunity to ""vote with their wallet"" and switch to e.g. a private school (with a different union) or homeschooling.  Police unions offer no such choice; if you don't like them well tough the unions' members still have jurisdiction over you unless you move.\s\s----\s\s¬π: That said public sector unions are frequently not voluntary at all (often extracting dues even from non-members and making such extraction a condition of employment) so from a left-libertarian standpoint they should be abolished and replaced with *voluntary* associations.""bake a cake with the phrase 'mandatory mask orders are unconstitutional.'""\s\sLogic fail meltdown.They can legally but I still think they‚Äôre a shitty service and will never buy a cake from them (assuming I‚Äôm capable of buying a cake from a bakery across the country)Sounds like the free market just workedJust go to a bakery who will bake your gay cake. It's a free market after allThe gays shouldn't have to. Every business owner must conform to any dopey request or any demand made by their customers.>It's a free market after all\s\sIf only.I'm not arguing with the idea that a business owner should have the right to refuse service based on their convictions but just for my own sake is there a line to be drawn? \s\sWhat if they live in a rural area and the town only has one bakery? Can someone refuse because of skin color or other religious affiliation?\s\sI'm libertarian through and through but these are questions I have always had. Hearing other's opinions on this would be helpful!If you do the vice versa this applies to conservatives as well.Yes we knowWho caresI support gay marriage and rights but a business has the rights to refuse to make something. They weren‚Äôt refused service the baker told them that you can have any cake. He said that he won‚Äôt make the custom cake because of his religion which is a perfectly valid point.\s\sHe has the rights to do that and the couple have to go buy from his competition. It may hurt his business but he should the rights to do so.By your logic the baker would also be allowed to refuse to make an interracial marriage cake if it conflicted with their religious values. Would you argue that they have that right as well?The gay couple who did this *purposely* went looking for a lawsuit. Either for the ""fame"" or a hustle or whatever their awful motivation was.\s\sMost gay couples wouldn't care.irrelevant conclusionYa it‚Äôs called freedom. Seriously all places have signs that say no shirt no shoes no service. That seemed to be perfectly fine. Now gay cakes and masks seem to be an issue. As long as it‚Äôs not a public place they can do whatever the hell they want. They own it.Finally my whites-only diner can re-open!No shirt no shoes no service is about health and safety risks not personal beliefs. Wearing a mask and social distancing is also about health and safety risks and not personal beliefs. Discrimination based on personal beliefs is illegal for obvious reasons. Suddenly we have black only and white only restaurants and people refuse business based on racism and bigotryThey sure can. As long as it's not the government enforcing a mask law.Alot of people in this thread seem to be REALLY missing the point here. Its not really about wether you should or shouldn‚Äôt be forced by a business to wear a mask. Or if a business should be forced to serve whomever demands their service. Thats just window dressing to convey the idea. \s\sIts the hypocrisy. Its the fact that in the case of the baker reddit was ALL for forcing his labor to bake something he disagreed with on a personal level but now they are okay with businesses denying service to those that dont want to wear a mask because they agree with it. \s\sThe point of the meme is that this shit cuts both ways. Either its okay for a business to deny service or it isnt. Either you let the market decide or you don‚Äôt but you cant have your cake and eat it too.It's not Hypocritical because the motivations and surrounding circumstances are different.\s\sThere's a difference in refusing service because doing so poses a danger to employees and customers and refusing service because you don't like where someone sticks their genitals in the privacy of their own home.\s\sIt's like saying ""If schools have the right to ban people with guns from entering then they also have the right to ban black people from entering""\s\sYou can not equate the two.They can also refuse to serve racist and people named Albert.They can also ostensibly refuse based on race transgender religion association etc.People will bend over backwards trying to convince you one is okay and the other isn't simple as OP put itThere's a difference in refusing service because doing so poses a danger to employees and customers and refusing service because you don't like where someone sticks their genitals in the privacy of their own home.\s\sIt's like saying ""If schools have the right to ban people with guns from entering then they also have the right to ban black people from entering""\s\sYou can not equate the two.Doubling down on dumb?Just out of interest: do you guys think businesses should be allowed to refuse service based on race ?Race and religion are protected under the constitution. Who you fuck isn't.I think they should be able to discriminate based on anything. They‚Äôre only hurting themselves if they won‚Äôt let me purchase something. If I went to a restaurant and they said we don‚Äôt serve straight white males I‚Äôd say ok thats your loss there are plenty of other restaurants to eat at. I also don‚Äôt believe many business owners would actually discriminate against people of certain groups. I have faith that most people are good at heartProtecting people from a disease outbreak that has killed over 100000 people = allowing a business to discriminate against people based on who they sleep with?Fucking isnt protected under the constitution but religious freedom is.I don‚Äôt think these two things are directly comparable. Not wearing a mask is a choice that potentially endangers yourself and people around you. Being gay isn‚Äôt nobody makes a choice on what their gender or sexuality is.\s\sOne of the major goals of the civil rights movement in the 60‚Äôs was getting black people equal access to services. Most people agree that denying service to people based on race is morally wrong so discrimination based on sexuality should be treated in the same way.\s\sTo say that a baker can deny any service to a gay couple sets a dangerous precedent that any business can discriminate against people based on any arbitrary trait. If the court case went in favour of the baker that would have gone against many of the core values of the civil rights movement and allow more widespread discrimination under law.The court case *was* decided in favor of the baker in a 7-2 decision in the Supreme Court. Masterpiece v. Colorado.Not wearing a masks endangers people who choose to go near the non-masker.  If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable being near non-maskers then don‚Äôt go near non-maskers.\s\sThe entitlement of this concept that someone should be required to wear a mask for the benefit of another persons comfort/safety is ridiculous.Your sexuality may not be a choice but the way that you express yourself certainly is. If you are expressing yourself in such a way that someone can visibly see that you are gay transgender etc then they should be able to judge you however they want and be able to refuse you their service. You may argue then about ‚Äúfreedom of expression.‚Äù If someone for example a neo-Nazi were to enter your place of business expressing anti Semitic views (e.g. a Swastika tattoo) you may want to refuse them service if you are offended by their expression of themself and their views. This should be allowed because you get to make the decision of who is allowed to receive service in your place of business. Similarly if a gay person comes into your business expressing themself in such a way that offends you you should be able to refuse them service. They have the choice to express themselves however they want and if a private business owner does not agree with their expression they should be allowed to deny them service. It‚Äôs not discrimination based on sexuality; if it were it would be more overt. Discrimination based on sexuality would be something like requiring employees to disclose to their employer their sexuality and then the employer reacting to this negatively. Refusing a service isn‚Äôt discriminating based on sexuality but rather the expression of that sexuality.just wear a mask pls.[removed]Businesses can discriminate however they want the people will just avoid them if the disagree with the racist/ sexist/ otherwise discriminatory actionsInsane that we have to spell this out to people.CorrectGreat comparison OP\s/sThis is actually a decent comparison. There is two major building supply stores in my town. One requires people to wear a mask the other doesn‚Äôt. The business that isn‚Äôt requiring people to wear a mask is seeing more customer than ever before and a lot of people who used to shop at the other business are shopping there now. In the same effect if someone doesn‚Äôt want to bake you a cake another business will gladly take that business. Free market ‚Äî works. The problem I have is when it becomes a government mandated thing but I think businesses can have the freedom to deny customers based on X sure.All business have the right to refuse service.\s\sBut this is a false equivalency between discrimination and public health/safety. The baker isn't at risk of catching the gay.Ok I'm a moron. What's the baking a cake part mean?Its a reference to the baker that refused to make a special cake for a gay couple on religious grounds. He won the SC case btw. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission\s\shttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/narrow-ruling-supreme-court-gives-victory-baker-who-refused-make-n872946But the supreme court ruled they can refuse to bake the cake?Yes the gay couple violated his first amendment rights. And since he was a private business he had the right to refuse service to whomever he pleased.This is true but this gets posted a lot by bible thumping conservatives and doesn't really have a good message.Supreme Court disagrees.they can refuse to bake your cake and 100% should be allowed to but also i think it‚Äôs stupid for any bakery to do thisObviously. Problem is that the people you're talking about are relativists and care for nothing except their own gain.Mid-2020: The ""Bake the Cake"" controversy is pretty damn low on the list of priorities right now.You could refuse to bake the cake and also miss out on potential profits. Tbh you‚Äôre better off just baking the fucking cake. More money and less problems.They also can fire you for having an opinion they don't like or defund your video from advertisements. \s\sFree speech does not exist in the workplace.I don't believe these ideas are related but I do agree to both.imagine thinking you have the right to another person‚Äôs labor lmaoThis also extends to race creed gender political ideology etc. Doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with doing it and frankly it only hurts business but I should not be allowed to force someone to serve me.false equivalencethis is like saying if you can take a driver‚Äôs license from someone who is blind you can take it from a black person under the exact same pretense.I‚Äôm sorry is pastry chef afraid that he‚Äôs gonna contract the big gay?Nah famI mean homosexuality isn‚Äôt an infectious potentially deadly disease but aight. The constitution literally says people can‚Äôt be discriminated against because who they are and their god. I might not sue but will I tell everyone ‚Äúhey these Bakers are some bitches that don‚Äôt like standard business‚Äù uh yeah. You could could make a local bakery file bankruptcy from them losing business(in certain placesüòú)Slowish burn I guess Idk dudeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èA gay baker would never be allowed to deny service to someone for being ChristianAh interesting it‚Äôs like the coke meme earlier the idea being that if a company is homophobic we should rely on a moral educated consumer ssd that will no longer support it for its immoral viewpoint?One is discrimination based on personal beliefs and one is discrimination based on health and safety. Unless you are saying that the dangers of covid 19 are based on personal beliefs as wellIsn't all knowledge based on belief?No.Just because they should be allowed to do something doesn‚Äôt make it any less fucked upIn general I agree a business should not be forced to serve anyone they choose not to that said when a business owner buys the ""Government"" liability shield that is an LLC S-Corp etc... I feel like an argument could be made that shield could come with some caveats such as not discriminating based on race religion gender etc....But these arnt the same thing....[deleted]Yup this is true and you know as much as i do there is really no such thing as libleft. They are as authoritarian as thier authleft counterparts...only thing is the authleft admit it.One is discriminating against someone because of their lifestyle the other is because of advice given by the government that applies to everyone? Sorry but these aren‚Äôt the same.What if your lifestyle is anarchism?It's not advice if it's mandated and enforced...Well thats the free market but because of freedom of speach we can critique his racist ideals and we can choose to bully him.>we can critique his racist ideals and we can choose to bully him.\s\sGay is not race.Masks would fall under the same category as no shirt no shoes no service but the wedding cake thing is clearly discrimination based on your religious beliefs. You aren't being discriminated against by not being allowed in a store without a mask any more than if you weren't allowed in for being shirtless.gay people dont put a business at risk of death\s.\s\snice one though guys.Weird neither do healthy peopleIt's about freedom of association.[Masks are a placebo.](https://www.rcreader.com/sites/default/files/Denis%20G.%20Rancourt%20PhD%20April%202020%20%22Masks%20Don%27t%20Work%3A%20A%20review%20of%20science%20relevant%20to%20COVID-19%20social%20policy%22.pdf)I‚Äôve been making this exact reverse argument. Every time I hear someone complain about a store not serving people without masks I just ask ‚ÄúGay cakes?‚ÄùI get your point. However that business does not have to state why they won‚Äôt service anyone. Of course freedom of religion is a right. Being gay isn‚Äôt a health risk. Also that baker could have simply said sorry we are booked. That way no bad pr for their business and that gay couple can‚Äôt say they were denied due to sexual preference. That way the baker wins without losing business and that gay couple has zero basis for discrimination. Wear a fucking mask!Because your sexual preference  is a choice just like wearing a mask. Also think of the risk to your health if you were to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.\s\sEdit\sWow I thought I didn't need a /sarcasm tag on this comment because the absurdity of it was obvious. Guess I was wrong.Do you need a /s or are you just that wrong?Lol imagine people willingly choosing to be discriminated on a daily basis by idiots like youIn one case the business is refusing to serve someone because of a potential safety issue. In the other case the business is refusing to serve someone because they don‚Äôt like the customer‚Äôs personal decisions. Terrible comparison. I still believe that businesses should not be able to discriminate based on gender race religion or sexual orientation. Why? Because discrimination based on those points just does not help anyone in anyway well maybe except for a few idiotic business owners who want to deny service for that in the first place.What is this trying to say? They can refuse all people that don't wear a mask but they're not allowed to refuse white people that don't wear a mask. They can refuse all people that want a cake but their not allowed to refuse gay people that want a cake.Objective hazards vs subjective people don't get it not serving a cake to a couple of dudes hooking up is just hateDiscrimination based on ‚Äúnot wearing a mask‚Äù is very different than discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation.Shut the fuck up and put your masks on you scum. ""Refusing to wear a mask because I'm a fucking moron"" is not a protected statusYou're misinterpreting the law.I mean it is a libertarian subreddit... most laws are dumbThen the law is badWhat law are you referring to?Bruh that shit happened like 5 years ago. No one cares about it anymore. Stop using it as an exampleConsidering that the supreme court is expanding the interpretation of anti-discrimination laws it is very relevant. Not to mention it is relevant simply because there are still plenty of people in this country who don't value freedom of association. Rather they feel the need to force people to provide their labor for others even if they don't want to. Companies should be allowed to discriminate as they want to and we should be allowed to boycott them (and probably should.)Bruh slavery happened like 148 years ago get over it.How about you guys read about what actually happened in the lawsuit against the bakery. The bakery originally said they would make the cake and by the time the wedding was supposed to happen and it would have been too late to use any other service they purposefully denied making the cake. It was a blatant act of bigotry fueled by hatred towards someone. Not ""expression of religious freedom.""Claims made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.Yes totally see how one business discriminating based on sex is exactly the same as another business trying to protect the public and their employees from a heath concern. Bravo.One is a public danger one is a dick sucking enthusiast. That‚Äôs a stretch to compare them tbh.You don't choose to be Gay or Black. You CAN choose not to wear clothes you CAN choose not to wear a mask. \s\sBut most people aren't to pleased with the idea of some 70 y/o nudist with a leaky Willy pissing on the merchandise. That might scare customers away some gay couple asking to have 2 grooms slapped on the top of a cake isn't really going to do that.\s\sAnd (almost) every business owner wants to get back to the status quo some think that opening up everything is going to make that happen. Others realize that limiting the spread to the best of everyone's ability is the correct way to move forward as long as they (and the economy) can scrape by.\s\sThey have a vested interest that you don't hamper their business by doing things like extending the pandemic infecting their loyal customers and their employees including themselves. \s\sEveryone has a vested interest that this pandemic is over by taking precautions I protect myself my family friends as well as strangers. In the long run everyone wins on that. If only more people would realize that and choose to do what they feasibly could achieve.\s\sAll people are being asked is to protect everything by wearing a mask. Be kind to your neighbor bake that cake and wear a mask. \s\s- some evil lib-lefty.One has to do with public health the other had to do with public ignorance.This is a surface level comparison. One example is business prejudice against an identity group and the other is prejudice against people who are a potential contagion to those they could come intact with including people who work at the store.conservatives are hypocritical they were all in favor of the master peice cakeshop when the cakeshop discrimated agianst the same-sex couple but if any cake shop discrimates agianst any christian event conservative christians are going to call ""persucation"" and that they are facing ""persucation"" for christ and file lawsuits to stop discrimation\s\sor any business discrimating agianst trump supporters and conservative christians are going to say they are ""persucated""I really am shocked at how many ""left libertarians"" I have to explain this to.  Some are actually surprised when they realize this.Ancom is a logically inconsistent ideology change my mind.Won‚Äôt try you‚Äôre right.I think anti vaxxers get more right...Flat-earthers of economics is more accurate I think.You're not wrong.not so fast on the anti-vaxxers bro.\s\sever the flat earthers are almost always in on their own joke.\s\s&#x200B;\s\ssocialists on the other hand are simply pathetic.This 100%Eh.

People should be saying they are fighting for equality of application of rights but its not as easy to sway people with that and pretending you're fighting the government to get them to change the law and give rights make the cause seem so much more worthwhile so that's why this wording is used. \s\sLibertarians should be focusing on rights as in freedoms not rights as in entitlements. Who is this guy? He said something cool.The guy is brilliant.\s\sHis Wikipedia page\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell\s\sHere are some of his best quotes.\s\shttps://www.brainyquote.com/lists/authors/top_10_thomas_sowell_quotes\sRead civil rights rhetoric or reality by him to defeat any argument for affirmative action \sRead civil rights rhetoric or reality by him to defeat any argument for affirmative action \sI usually agree with this guy but I think he missed the point here.I think that the way the phrases are used is to defend or push for privilege for said groups.  I think he was alluding to that but didn‚Äôt communicate adequately.I believe in equal rights...equal property rights...That's like saying a ""hate crime"" is only a crime -- ""motive"" matters in any criminal prosecution.  \s\sA guy slapping another guy on the ass  -- such as someone from his team that is his friend while they're laughing together while playing football game could IF taken out of context be considered an assault when it's not intended to be; however \s\sa guy leering at and making lewd remarks to strangers passing by on a public sidewalk and slapping them on the ass would be an entirely different story.[deleted]It‚Äôs 3 days old. If you post anything of Thomas sowell i will upvote it. Every time.It is a contradiction people either want equal rights or they want rights for special groups. They can't have it both ways. \s\sIt goes back to one not being about to not discriminate without discriminating. Can I hug this one?It's a bad question it presupposes that choice is something provided in nature when in fact choices come from people. Choice is something a person provides to themselves (giving yourself choices in life) or provides to others (as different opportunities).\s\sIf someone says ""I have no choice"" they are actually saying ""I am not giving myself a choice"". That is if the question is about working for food they are not giving themselves a choice to starve.\s\sThe use of the word ""free"" (as in free market) is also only meant in a social sense and not meant as an escape from reality/nature in fact a free market lets reality/nature work its way into the system making it visible and allowing it to be controlled.\sTHANK YOU!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING INTO WORDS!I don't think Hunter gatherers hated Hunter gathering. Lazy ppl invented farming cuz they thought it'd be easier than hunting *snortle* the problem is Federalists who feared populist agrarianism more than anything else. 40 acres and a mule? I'd rather raise food than go to hobby lobby or taco bell for 30 hours per week deal with shitty customers obnoxious bosses etc. All for minimum wage + food stamps...Even ignoring the conclusion in the comic for a moment if ""freedom"" is the kid's primary concern how can forcing others to support his parasitical existence increase ""freedom""? Because although he and his degenerate comrades might feel more free while living it up on the fruits of other's labor (like thieves after a successful job) those who are forced to provide for them are certainly less free. The sign he's holding is logically inconsistent.\s\sWhen pointing this out to leftists they just hand wave some post scarcity bullshit. Until we're pampered from cradle to grave by a self sustaining robot army that does literally everything they have no point whatsoever.The very notion of ""post scarcity"" is good for a laugh every time. I've yet to see a good explanation for how something like that could possibly work. [I think this is relevant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY4yJoSSMZM)To be fair a large chunk of jobs is just making junk that doesn't contribute much to survivalBecause our economy is efficient enough that it can support more than survival. Not exactly bc the profits are used to do just that...This be so /r/shitstatistssayThink? Libertarians sure do a lot of thinking for poor performing students at community colleges who are only able to understand the simplicity of Austrian Economics and Ayn Rand lmao. I am convinced that if more of you were intelligent enough to read other philosophers you would immediately turned off by libertarianism. There is a reason why libertarian intellectuals are rare and almost nonexistent at elite institutions today. Ayn Rand wasn't a libertarian...Thinks Rand is a libertarian lectures about intelligence and reading. \s\sYou rekt yourself son.This is Political Facebook Page levels of bad bait. ""You guys are stupid! If you were less stupid you wouldn't be [X thing important to the page identity].""

I wish I could tell you that things will get better for you in the future but that's a bit too optimistic to be completely honest.Uh oh someone is a little upset Because universities are liberal and want professors to be pushing liberalism.

Socialism has crippled it.  Sure your dentist and prescriptions are free but the poverty is just too sadI am going to tell you this my Cuban boss at the time told me. If I earn $5k a month and pay $1k to go to the dentist it is still a lot better than earning $30 a month and having the dentist for free. It means I am paying really $4970 to go to the dentist.Dentists are free because the teeth are unused.I can't be wrong it must be ***the people who actually lived through it***Guys I love communism so much that I bought a hammer and sickel flag from amazonThis guy is barely *sentient* enough to be aware that the word he was looking for is *SENTIMENT*.Communists are not sentient beings‚ÄúWithout knowing a damn thing about it‚Äù is pretty rich coming from someone who grew up in Miami as opposed to Havana.I live in Tel Aviv Israel.

Imagine simping for Castro (who's sexist and racist) or Mao (who caused death of millions of Chinese people).Imagine being so stupid that you believe those two things.What makes this better is that Cuba was ""the revolution within the revolution"" where they were supposed to have learned from the mistakes of Russia and China and were gonna do communism right this time.The people in that subreddit were saying that the only people that came from Cuba were the wealthy high class but  just go ask any Cuban (my family included) to find out that we were just normal low-working-middle class people.And everyone with a little bit of common senseCuban immigrants are so based. I knew a couple who came over during Operation Pedro Pan or wet foot dry foot and they were super coolWell gee I wonder why a bunch of Cubans who were ether deported or fled from a shitty communist dictatorship might not have a favorable view of Communism having lived and suffered under it.

Social democracy is a completely different thing except to a cohort of young Americans who think Bernie Sanders invented both in 2016.European countries are mostly ""Social Democracies"" UK tried Democratic Socialism in the 1960s and it failed.\s\sUK still has free healthcare (Which I think is an acceptable position for a government to take) while just completing two aircraft carriers.I am a European and many people I know think countries like Norway Finland and Germany are socialist. Not true at all. The european countries that actually try to be socialist live pretty badlyas a fairly centrist brit this acc kinda seems to be the case though i wouldn't say national defence but rather military influenceEuropean here. We COULD afford more defense but we won‚Äôt because ‚Äûwell USA will do the job we are not part of the NATO we have such uncomfy Terrain no one wants us to invade Europe is at peace and we don‚Äôt Need an Army what do you mean the nearest war is only 600km away from us??‚ÄúYou in a country near Ukraine?This. Just this. If I hear the term ""democratic socialism"" one more time I will flip. It did not exist does not exist and will never exist because any regime that introduces socialism is not a regime willing to let go of power and organize free elections.Also literally the entire point of the US is that you‚Äôre not a slave to the majority just because it was voted on.It starts as Democratic Socialism but soon becomes International Socialism with the hammer and sickle or National Socialism with the other thing. In either international or national case socialism means camps for dissenters. And not the fun kind.I live under free market capitalism that's why I can't open a fucking business without giving a shit tone of money to the state or choose where I go to school or decide where I go to the doctor. Because my country is violently capitalist I have to pay about 60% of my hole money to the state and they then choose which business they support and which they force to close and I am not able to enter in determined business sectors because they are already controled by the state... Yes a very beautiful capitalism we have in my european country...Sounds like ItalyIs it Germany?Dutch person here. Yes this is very much true. We literally lease tanks from Germany because we can't buy/produce our own. Some soldiers don't even have helmets due to our low budget. Police officers also suffer from a low budget. It sucks.I believe the Germans sent you guys tanks back in the late 1930's. \s\sI'm joking! But it sounds like a serious problem. I feel bad for you guys.The Bundeswehr? Last I heard it was in a pitiful state down from its 1980s Cold War peak.Of course this would happen if your defence minister is just ""party puppet"" without any military knowledge or anything. Which cares more about trans people rights instead actually buying fuel for the army not even talking about spare parts.   \s\s\sAlso keep in mind that % of the military budget spend bureaucracy of the Dutch army is one of the highest in the world. This money is practically just wasted on nothing. If not that then with defence budget that high you could afford to equip 2 modern divisions within 5 years.    \s\s\sKinda sad not gonna lieHolland sucks you don't have enough tanks. this won't make you feel better but\sHungary sucks more. We literally have entire counties where there is no ambulance at the main hospital at night. the air force mainly consist of like 11 gripensI don't see any problem with that less military less useless jobs.German here. Can confirm.What's up with Merkel wanting the US troops in Germany to stay?THIS and when trump demanded they pay or we pull out they lost their shit and claimed russia would invade them lolhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thesun.co.uk/news/5177666/russia-military-drills-invasion-europe-vladimir-putin/amp/?espv=1\s\s\sCan you blame them? LolYea Trump demanded that the EU pays the US for military assistance. Makes no sense because why would we when\s\s1. You Americans have a corrupt elite that enriches themselves off military contracts\s\s2. We could just spend it here\s\sGermany (which is not as socialist but still more than the US) spends 7% of its state budget and 2.5% of its total GDP on defense (3.5% US) this with no imperialist moves no active wars for many many years and no conflict with Russia.\s\sSweden is pretty armed they have their own Leopard 2A6s and their own fighter plane manufacturer (SAAB) who also make Finland pretty strong.\s\sI don't see where Europe lacks military spending. Only very small countries like the Netherlands spend too little but then again so does Mexico because they can't defend themselves against their much stronger neighbor anyway.\s\sPoint out where the EU has failed to be sufficiently militarily present. Don't name the Ukraine that one is impossible to solve militarily without wiping out the entire European population.Redditors have problem with understanding what socialism is. Socialism literally means people own means of the production (in reality states owns them) and that there is no private property. If you have a country as Germany which businesses are 86% privately owned it is not a socialism. Plus I have experienced public healthcare I don't want to pay for that shit anymore. Everything government does costs more and is less efficient. They talk about the best healthcare in the world but they compare it to other public healthcare. So they compare shitty thing to another more shitty thing and then they present the shitty thing as something good it's still shitty. They think that if you have public healthcare you are set for life. No you are not. If you get cancer you will get ÀùfreeÀù radiation when you get in the line but you will still spend shit load of money on medicines that these public services don't provide. I know I had two cases in my family and we had to pull all of our connections to get them radiation and we have spend shit ton of money on medicines for them. If you have shit that you would probably survive like flu yeah but everything that is more threatening to you you ae fucked. In my homeland you had people being scheduled for an CT in 2 years and they had strong head pains and doctor told them they have to urgently get examined. But yeah let's give money to these people so they could enrich themselves and provide us with subpar services.Where do you reside?Yeah I heard the healthcare was pretty terrible and I‚Äôm worried about that. I really hate it when they say the us healthcare is horrible compared to Europe‚Äôs when Europe‚Äôs is a lot worst than the usa healthcare. I heard stories of Canadians going to the USA because the healthcare in Canada is terrible.People on the left support social democracy and then people on the right accuse them of being communists. The misunderstanding (often intentional) of what these terms mean goes both ways.[deleted]Not to mention the fact that their public healthcare system has no need to innovate because they rely on private US companies to do thatTrust me Americans once you have to pay 65% in taxes you won't be calling your country free market capitalist anymore. I bet you also call Bernia Sanders a capitalist right?\s\sWestern Europe is market socialist. Sicerely: A Western European who wants to move the fuck out.I mean if I pay 65% of my salary in taxes but those taxes cover things like healthcare and education I would normally have to pay out of pocket for I‚Äôd rather that system to be honest.And if ur us: oil (Norway)Fun fact also ~~Nordic~~ Scandinavian nations have almost unfathomable per capita resource extraction. It's almost like supporting a welfare state nation is easy when oil is shouldering the cost.\s\sWorked great for Venezuela too... Initially. Oh well at least these openly capitalist nations have the common sense to know that they can't rely on the privilege of oil (and externalised defence) forever like Venezuela tried to and at least they're trying to diversify their economy.Finland doesn't have oil isn't part of the Nato and has a comparatively large military.You know the Norwegians don‚Äôt directly fund welfare healthcare free education etc directly through oil profits that they extract right now right? You know they knew back in the ‚Äò60s that it would run out eventually? They knew back then that oil had a volatile market price?\s\sTo get consistent returns for effectively forever they use diversified investment funds to generate returns from oil profits to use in the future. Essentially as long as the world economy doesn‚Äôt permanently shit itself Norway will always have the income they have now.\s\sIn other words Venezuela spent the oil money directly on social programs. Norway invested said money on diversified portfolios to generate cash indefinitely. They planned ahead Venezuela didn‚Äôt.Dane here. We have next to no oil mining etc. We do have wind though. Is that something you don‚Äôt have in the US?That‚Äôs literally only Norway what are you talking about?Outsourced in trade for opening up our European markets to American products yes. A fair trade. The US wanted to be the world‚Äôs policeman and they got to be it and in trade European countries relinquished control over their colonial empires. \sBesides two of the countries that are most often used as example for ‚Äòdemocratic socialism‚Äô Norway and the Netherlands built their social welfare state on the profits of the sale of natural resources (oil and natural gas respectively). That‚Äôs where the money came from not from outsourcing our military defence to the US. Another good example of social democracy Sweden spent an impressive amount of money on defence during the Cold War and so did the French and the Brits. \sI expect better from a sub against communism because there are so many good arguments to be made against socialism and communism.Exactly. Italy spent quite a lot of money on defense too. We still have a functioning welfare net (at least here in the north it works good)Honestly this whole thread feels like ultra'muricans circlejerking their undefendable position exactly like modus operandi if the leftists. Yes outsourcing of military and medical research to US is true to a degree but until somebody can provide relevant data that Europe would be invaded or couldn't afford appropriate defense or healthcare if US didn't have this extremely bloated and overpriced military and medical research complex I call bullshit.\s\sEurope tried socialism and (mostly) learnt from it US is trying unregulated capitalism which already de facto switched to corporate oligarchic feudalism but they are still too proud to come to terms with that it isn't the way forward either. \s\sJust leave NATO and sell us those few very specific drugs you developed for full price to see what will happen nobody is stopping you. Make a referendum about leaving NATO and pass a bill so that your companies cannot sell us drugs cheaper than they are sold in the US it's that easy.[deleted]Actually we can‚Äôt afford it.Couldn‚Äôt be more true here in the U.K. most of the gdp goes to the nhs and our military is a joke of what it once wasThe largest navy in Europe. 2 Aircraft carriers both more powerful than China and Russias. Highest rated intelligence agencies in the world second only to the US. What exactly are you talking about?Bingo all countries except like 4 are interconnected and have ...‚Äùexpertise or roles‚Äù in the global economy. idk why we pretend to not know this? Imagine the headlines if we were isolationist while China commits Genocide & Iran sponsors terrorism etc...Surely the significantly higher taxes in Western Europe is what pays for their social care programmes?\s\sThe legacy of the cold war is that most European countries have military links with the US but that doesn't in turn direct the type of governments these countries elect and aspire to.Democracy =/= freedomEuropean here:this is not entirely true. But it is in part true! Big part though!and also smaller populationThe EUs population is over 100 million larger than the US what are you talking about?As a European the defense part isn‚Äôt true European counties finance their welfare systems from selling natural resources and by paying shitload more taxes than in the USAnd would have raise taxes even further for them to meet their  Nato commitments!I live in Sweden and I'll have you know we don't rely on anyone. Democratic socialism is completely different from communism there's a reason why we were as weary of the USSR as the US wasAnd have smaller concentrated populationThat's not true. I speak from the perspective of my own country (Italy) and we do have a decent military while also having a welfare net.Bullshit. During the latter half of the 20th century Sweden had a huge military compared it's population. During all of that time it was never involved with NATO or any other major alliances and they still procude their own figther jets naval assets and is a leading nation in armament manufacturing.\s\sAll this while as I'm sure you know having one of the most generous welfare systems in the world. And the reason for this is not because they have some form of abundance of resources to draw upon. \sWhile the steel mining is important the success comes from industry innovation and generally good system.\s\sJust look at Finland. It uses what is essentially the same system and has seen just as much if not even more success.\s\sSadly it seems modern politicians are on a good way destroy this legacy because of what's basically SJW policies but that legacy was *not* built thanks to the U.S.Its specifically called social democracy wich is different from democratic socialism\s\sSocialdemocracy is basically just welfare states. like the Republic of Weimar\s\st. yuropeanBeep. Boop. I'm a robot.\sHere's a copy of \s\s###[The Republic](https://snewd.com/ebooks/the-republic/)\s\sWas I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)Also a large chunk of jobs financing and their funds reside in or from AmericaIt‚Äôs not socialism but Switzerland can afford it without outsourcing defense to the us.And health careCapitalist economies with strong social safety nets and social programs is exactly what American progressives want. No one except irrelevant Twitter leftists wants actually socialism.\s\sAlso European militaries are perfectly capable of national defense. We keep troops there out of our own interest in maintaining pseudo imperialistic military dominance around the world. Most countries militaries are just there to protect that country which European countries by and large could do without a single American soldier.I mean who are we meant to be fighting why would we need to build even larger militaries than we have? The British and French are nuclear powers with some of the best conventional militaries in the world that they continue to use for their own geopolitical ambitions Finland is not under the US umbrella and holds a sizeable military to deter Russia while pushing forward some of the more charitable social programs in Europe. European nations can largely compete with the Russians militarily and beyond them there really isn't any other threat. It's a strange unsubstantiated American exceptionalist position to claim that European nations are only capable of the social programs we decided to have because of some nebulous US benevolence. Especially given they are the only power to actual call their NATO allies to their defence.Damn I just discovered this sub and i love ithave to disagree you should see the fucking tax rates in said countriesGreek here. The part of the USA reliance is absolutely not true. We spend the few billions that we have in the military. The part of democratic socialism is true though .Put this on the dog that hurts you in other ways formatIs there a source for this information?I don't care how they got it bro I just want to to take a sip of that sweet prosperity. I don't know what non-politicians are trying to achieve trying to crack the code. Does it make it easier to choose the right candidate or something? I get curious too sometimes but I imagine I'll never get anywhere near knowing how if I'm not directly involved somewhere in there. So not too curious.TrueWeird I don‚Äôt remember Americans ever sending troops to Spain to aid us. I do remember when Spain sent troops to aid the US in the mess you made in the Middle East though.Big if trueBollocks! Sweden Finland and Switzerland aren't relying on american military help. France has nuclear weapon so it is protected enough.I agree with the first part but it seems like they can pay for welfare for lots of other reasons like a lot of free trade over time especially before the welfare state.\s\sHow much of their national defense have they outsourced directly to the US? That is the defense they explicitly asked the US for help and assuming they would invest only as much as they need for their defense or the value to get equivalent defense or even what the average country in their condition spends on defense. Not assuming they would spend the absurd proportion of GDP the US spends.\s\sIt doesn't even seem like they don't even need much defense. Despite the high taxes on the middle class they have a lot of free trade no military-industrial complex and other countries don't hate them that much. Even if it's expensive it's one more reason the US is the one being not very smart here again.Shit take claiming that the 0.2% gdp difference in military expenditure is gonna make or break a welfare state is fucking stupid. \s\sThe reason why those nations are able to utilize those systems isn‚Äôt a simple one there‚Äôs not one catch-all reason why it works. \s\sNorway has oil Sweden has stupid high taxes etc etc but they all have ways of collecting the revenue and then receiving the benefits of that expenditure later.\s\sAnd you can hate the personal costs of free education you can dislike how many tax dollars are spent on it but there‚Äôs no denying that free post-secondary has a massive positive effect on a nations over-all economy. A more educated work-force generates more value for the nation and the Nordic countries have wagered that fronting the cost for education pays out long term with more educated individuals earning higher income and paying more tax dollars as a result. Democratic  socialism  is oxymoron.Socialism reque dictatorship to be implemented.I keep telling people like no it is not democratic socialism it is literal capitalism with big welfare services. And yet they tell me I was wrong. I‚Äôm glad this proves a lot about Nordic Countries.And also because they tax their citizen atleast 40%Nvm they pay about that amount my 2nd point still stands though(escalating costs) I'm also not entirely convinced that public Healthcare is at the forefront technologically Denmark a country in the top 5 according to the numbeo index although it offers public Healthcare has a significant element of privatization in the medical sector.\s\sAs an example the cost of:\s\sPsychotherapy\s\sPsychology\s\sFertility treatments\s\sDental care past the age of 18\s\sMEDICINE \s\sare all treatments that either aren't or are scarcely subsidized.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism <‚Äî the definition of democratic socialismThat's a lot of extra words to explain socialism thoughBut people in Europe are against the USA military ""aid""....You just described democratic socialism retard.Come back when you're 18So your saying defense against aggressors is the only problem with welfare and without that barrier welfare is a good thing? Did you even try to follow this nonsense to any logical conclusions? This is ignoring the fact you are likely using one definition of demsoc that is contrary to the the definition used by demsoc Americans and nearly no one argues has anything to do with the style of government in any euro state... there are so many logical fallacies in here it is painful.People call that democratic socialism.Is there a source for this?we have capitalism and it sucks (but under communism it sucked even more)As if all countries with universal healthcare are in the NATO or similar. This meme is complete nonsense and just a weak excuse for why the US can't accomplish something the rest of the First World had.The meme is half right. The US spends ~16% of the current budget on military and Bernie and AOC are idiots for saying Nordic countries/Europe is socialist and making young people think those places are such.\s\sTax to GDP OECD\s\shttps://images.app.goo.gl/Bwu6iVcjjZDHnrCh9\s\sHowever the main reason is the US still has pretty low taxes. Many European countries have more social safety nets because they tax everyone more than the US does (not just the 1%) through broad-based taxes like VAT and lower threshold for the top marginal income tax rates.bSorry guys I'm as anti-communist as it comes but this particular argument is just an absolute bullshit pack of lies that fox news peddles out as an excuse for your politicians not to give you a return on your tax investment.\s\sMy country the UK already spends the NATO 2% target of GDP on defence and intends on spending further still yet we can still afford nationalised healthcare and an expansive welfare system. The only reason the USA has any military presence here is because of post-cold war adventurism and a desperate need to justify a bloated military budget. Any US protections offered to the UK outside of the commitments to NATO are mostly negligible and are there exclusively to fit the USA's desire to be here seeing as it's almost exclusively in the form of air bases but the UK deals with its own rapid air response and defence capabilities. \s\sThe only thing stopping you from spending that money somewhere else is yourselves not Europeans. Dont blame us for your politicians mishandling of public funds.Exactly!I'm pretty sure that Europe would be fine on their own.No no no our ""large"" welfare systems have nothing to do with the US. It's not that the US doesn't have such an extensive welfare because it has to protect the rest of the world or whatever Americans think their God-given mission is so they have to spend that money on the military. The US could afford the same welfare it just chose not to - it's just a different model. I can't believe Americans are trying to make our welfare which is our important achievement & advantage look possible thanks to the US while aggressively declining to introduce similar policies **in** the US.\s\sThis being said we're definitely market economies and commies need to understand that.I‚Äôm a socialist. No one thinks the Nordic countries are socialist. Please stop with this massive be straw man.This relies on a pretty fundamental point of ignorance.\s\sIn order to believe this you would have to assume that privatised healthcare is cheaper than nationalised healthcare. In reality it's actually the other way around. The US spends around twice as much per person on healthcare compared with developed nations.EU is neither democratic or capitalist???????So we can't have M4A because military big? Sounds like a great reason to be in one of those scary socdem Nordic countries lolIt's pretty racist to want to live in a Nordic (white) country. Why commies gotta be so racist all the damn time?‚ÄúLargely outsourced‚Äù don‚Äôt act like Europeans begged you guys to spend such a ridiculous amount on military lmao. You do that to feed your rich not out of the kindness of your heart but whatever.The cold war was a thing you know.They did it was a result of WW2 you know when everyone militaries in Europe were seriously damaged along with their infrastructure and ability to defend their economiesThen why is wanting to pull troops out seen as a far right extremist position?This is largely incorrect. First of all you're talking about western & Northern European countries because nobody is proposing adopting the ""Ukraine model"" in America. And the thing about western European countries is thag they don't actually face legitimate threats to their security. Russia is a paper tiger even in Eastern Europe the idea of a Russian attack on western Europe is laughable. So if you understand the actual security situation of these countries you'll realise they actually overspend on their militaries relative to the security challenges they face. American military infrastructure in Western Europe exists for one reason only which is mainitaing America's world-empire.\s\sWestern Europe are not democratic socialist countries true. But America absolutely could afford their welfare systems it comes down to will. So while ""we can't have welfare because we protect Europeans"" is a nice story to tell oneself the actual reason is ""Muh personal freedom - > personal responsibility"" Republican ideology. Also maintenance costs for that whole world-empire thing of courseJust posted this image on r/socialism.No one cares loli mean to counterbalance this european countries spend much more than the US (as a percentage of GDP) on foreign aidThe US is the only nation in NATO to ever call its allies to arms.AS SPANISH that is Studying a lot of history:  I can say this is fairly accurate the MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR: the Marshal Plan and ""El Milagro Espa√±ol"".\sThe Marshal Plan was Not meant for military usejust to fix economy it was going to help Spain to but there was a fascist dictator so money wasn't sent untill the cold war. This is because Franco (the dictator) described himself as anti Communist the US saw the geostrategic value of Spain and decided to invest in it this economic change was literary called ""El milagro Espa√±ol"" = "" the Spanish Miracle"" this change was very important because the system completely changed from a European Fascist North Korea to a fascist/liberal totalitarian country. And since Spanish people were able to communicate with the exterior they found the huge benefits of Democracy.This post is 3 months old so i don't think you'll even reply but i don't think that is 100% true. I live in Finland which is in fact not a NATO country or in any other military alliance with the US. That's why every man has to serve a year in the military cause we actually need to defend ourselves. A extensive welfare policy is possible even with a relatively powerful military but it requires they country's population to be constantly growing at a high rate so that you always have more young people supporting the aging population. That's why our country is going in to debt our birthrates have plummitet. There are very valid criticisms of welfare states but just claiming that they are only possible because of reduced military spending which would only offer saving of 3-5% is not the way.This is not entirely true.\s\sIt is a part of the reason but they also collect more taxes and some nations have less corporate taxes(to allow companies to reduce taxes) to allow high paying jobs and tax the income of the high paying job people.\s\sThey tax smartly and spend wisely that is the main reason. The engine that drives all these are capitalist only. Even in nations like France and Belgium with 70% govt involvement in GDP the government too acts in a fairly competitive way.\s\sAlso Europe is always in a tug of war between privatization and socialization. Privatization will increase GDP growth and Socialization will spread that wealth across the population.I totally agree with this. But there are expections Finland and sweden for example are officially neutral and largely fund their militaries by themselves.I am anti communist but this post is totally wrong. Finland and Sweden are not in NATO and still have incredible welfare politics and relatively strong military forces. As for my country (France) yes it is a NATO member but we can count on our military to defend ourselves (we have a permanent seat at the UN security council and atomic nukes) AND a strong welfare system. My idea is that the person who made this post and the ones who upvoted it don't know anything about Europe. You can be anti communist have a strong military AND a generous welfare system.Thanks for your inputNo educated democratic socialists or communists believe that the European nations are socialist. \sThey have large social safety nets but they are at the core capitalist nations."

I love how most politicians are willfully oblivious to this shit until it happens to them. And do take note that since DHSs (and specifically TSAs) inception there's been a push to get them not just at the airports but in every bus station and train station in America.
