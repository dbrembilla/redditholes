    "# RedditHoles - A study in  internet Rabbit Holes\n",
    "\n",
    "## An introduction to Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a social media platform organised in communities, rather than individual connections. This makes the experience on the platform quite different from other Social Networks and closer, in a way, to the one of forums.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### u/User\n",
    "A user (also called redditor, usually referred as “u/” followed by the username) can make a post (also called a submission); posts (also called submissions) can be links, videos, pictures, polls or text. The OP (Original Poster) as well as other users can comment and vote (either upvote or downvote) the post if they find it interesting (so it’s not exactly like like/dislike features of other Social Networks). Finally, users can give posts awards by paying for reddit coins; these recognise the contributions of a post or comment. There are hundreds of these, from a generic gold or silver award to some following internet lingo, such as the “F” award (used ironically to ‘pay respect’). \n",
    "\n",
    "Users can mark their posts as spoilers and multiple types of flairs and markings such as OC (Original Content), Spoilers, +18 and so on. Some subreddits might have rules for posting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users can be humans or bots. Bots have multiple uses, from auto moderation, to answering with quotes from movies and books, waving flags to other utilities and fun uses. \n",
    "#### The average redditor\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit users, according to [data from the site itself](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising/audience), are more than 50 million with more than 100 thousand communities. They are mostly male (56%) and have between 18 and 34 year old (58%). \n",
    "\n",
    "### r/Subreddits\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is structured in subreddits, communities that group in various ways the interested users. Subreddits can vary from cute pets, to political parties, to recipe advice. Subreddits are usually referred to as “r/” followed by the name of the subreddits (in our case, we will study “r/conspiracy” and related subreddits). \n",
    "\n",
    "Subreddits can vary significantly. They can have rules for posting, different levels of moderation and bot acceptance, all depending from the nature of the subreddit. Rules of subreddits can have different nature; some subreddits may require the content of a post to be marked, some require sources to be linked, some can have no rules at all. This ambiguity makes Reddit a much more decentralised and open Social Network in which some of the cut down on fake news and trolls which happened on sites such as Facebook or Twitter has not yet happened at the same level. \n",

    "In order to access data from the Reddit API, we used the [`praw` python library](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw). \n",
    "In order to use that, we need:\n",
    "- a Reddit account.\n",
    "- a Reddit app ([here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) you can create one). Here you'll find the client id under the app name once you create it, as well as the client secret and the user agent, which is your app name.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Our objective is to watch how a piece of news or a post is shared between different subreddits. While most social network would measure shares of a post, Reddit is built in a way that if a link is shared in the platform, it is possible to retrieve how much the original link is shared through subreddits. As an example, if an image from imgur is shared, we can use its url to search for the same object on Reddit.\n",
