\s^(Please stop by the rest of the) [^Wholesome ^Network ^Of ^Subreddits](http://old.reddit.com/user/awkwardtheturtle/m/wholesome)  ^too.Awh so sweet ❤️She's gorgeous thoDid anybody else read ""Vagina"" or is it just me?My grandfather had a picture of me at my kindergarten graduation when he passed in prison after trying to escape Vietnam. I never met him and I was a teenager at the time. I'm much older now and I still think about him and the desire he had to see me some day.\s\sYou have an amazingly special moment. Cherish it.Damn i live with this girl. Like im a lodger at her placeI want the story!Look two comments aboveYour grandpa hasn’t aged a bit!These two pictures were taken at the exact same time what the hell? He's just *holding* an old photo.so... you're legal?Show viagianne.The best leaders understand that a leadership position is one of responsibility to and for others and that authority is just one part of leadership. Far too many get it wrong and overly focus on authority.Jail cells are built to make the prison industrial complex money. Thousands of falsely accused rapists and people who just got arrested for being homeless...I can love like this someone please call me to use[removed][removed]Damn..... this makes me feel like I matter. Hey I MATTER! She suspends the white kidsr/nothingeverhappens[removed]“It’s not your fault you’re flunking out and not trying at all in school. We live in a society.”Yeah but some kid at my school got in trouble for mimicking jerking off in front of a girl. What do they do with him?You do matter. Make us proud.Telling a child that the surrounding society is constructed in order to keep them down especially when the exact opposite is empirically true is tantamount to child abuse. The rest of the message is quite nice though.I wish i had that growing up in my school system. “Society built down around us”\s... what does this mean?Society can be great but jf you are dumb(ie don't pay attention in school) you get a shitty job. If you commit a crime jails have to be built for you. Everything was going well until they realized you were a problem. I hate this meme of “high school dropout” = “criminal fuckup.” Guy I knew in high school dropped out because he was not smart enough to really cut it. But he was a great hardworking guy who got into house painting and now has more than ten guys working for him. He’s married to a woman who keeps the books and stuff and he has 3 kids and makes more money than I do who went to an Ivy League school. Smarts are not what life is built around.I just shed a tear. This is inspiring.My “safe school counselor” was named mrs lopez. she was a bitch i hope she’s 6 feet under authority is not a thing to lord over those who are subordinate to. authority is a responsibility for the collaboration and the successes of others. good authority lifts up instead of pushing down.[deleted]Dude chill out it's ok to be supportive of children If this actually worked someone would have noticed 20000 years ago and just used ""pep talks"" to drive society into a utopia.\s\sSomeone find Melinda Gates and show her this meme so she can stop wasting all that fucking money on curing disease and just use those billions to hire a fucking pep talker for every school.[removed][removed][removed][removed]gonna be a hell of a succesfulbdrug dealer You shouldn't be in the same room as Marie Antoinette. You would behead her with that edge.[removed]As a teacher..different students need different things. Often a suspension does not help. Suspending a child that doesn't want to be at school to begin with doesn't make sense. She wants them to feel safe and valued at school and wants them to know that she cares if they succeed. Its a more personable approach. If a child doesn't want to be at school the solution is to foster an environment that they *do* want to take part in and give them a reason to why it matters. It might have worked for you but if the child doesn't have involved parents a suspension just feels like a vacation for acting bad. Its a way for the school to just get them out of their hair and hope parents take the reins. And how many kids do you see taking suspensions as free days out of school? There were kids in my school who tried to get in school suspensions because you'd have to do less work.\s\sYour experience isn't typical of everyone else's so don't use it as an absolute. You're definitely right about some people but not allI think she's essentially saying ""You don't suck. Things around you suck but you can be different"". At least that's my interpretation of it. And for what it's worth every time I was suspended for cutting class it just reaffirmed for me that it wasn't important I be there. You put my thoughts of this in words I agree 100%Retribution is a stronger motivator than fearAhh exactly what I needed this morningO captain my captainNot arguing with your point about authority figures could extended it to doctors cops lawyers etc.\s\sBut I'd say it needs to start with the parents more than anything.Yeah...kids tottaly talk like this. The most wholesome of memesI get that people can go through a lot of shit that isn't an excuse to break rules...Photo and interview credit as far as I'm aware: Brandon Stanton www.humansofnewyork.com\s\sI either have complete respect or disgust in people depending on how they treat children. This person seems to be one of those people you'd want to trust with such an important job. Brandon Stanton’s Humans Of New York is truly inspirational and keeps me going everyday. There’s so many more interviews he does with people of all ages and outside of New York. \sBesides the website he’s also on Instagram and Twitter. And there’s a Facebook Watch series of this. I highly recommend everyone to check it out!He also has a Patreon which if anyone can afford a couple bucks a month I highly recommend. He’s so incredible at finding causes in need of attentionThanks for posting this. One of the few things I missed about Facebook was seeing these stories.I love you ms lopezNow that is what I call a teacher !Really great moral thoughtsTHIS IS NOT A MEME\sReddit stealing from instagram. And balance was restored in the Universe\s\sEdit: it was meant as a joke since everybody is talking about how instagram steals from reddit. Although I agree that keeping the username makes it completely different.I think we need to stop calling it stealing and just accept that it's the internet. We would have to do that about 4.38e+18 times more to get everything prefectly balancedOk? Who tf cares? Are you new around here?It's also on his Facebook page...My principal tried sending me to alt school after I told her my ex girlfriend was having her new boy toys harass me because my ex hit her with the ""he's creepy and I'm gay""The students name? Albert EinsteinMy principal would call me a failure and send me home.Having a no suspension policy is a terrible idea.I wish l had a teacher like that in my school [removed]Yeah let's shun children from society because they're having emotions (or even abuse) they can't process. Let's just put every child jail the first time they mess up instead of trying to correct the behavior while they're young with love and understanding. Obvs /s[removed]Onions?Ms Lopez a real oneOh god the waterworks started to fall at the last sentence. I'm so happy for him and his class. Anyone who can teach these baby boys that society was vuilt to keep them down but they can navigate aroubd it is a Godsend!\s\sSigh I also started crying because my principals never expressed that we mattered. They just had their favorites and that was that.Despite how uplifting this was its likely that the poor and disadvantaged kids still continued to get in trouble and failled to capitalize on their unconcentrated potential.[removed]I hate this meme of “high school dropout” = “criminal fuckup.” Guy I knew in high school dropped out because he was not smart enough to really cut it. But he was a great hardworking guy who got into house painting and now has more than ten guys working for him. He’s married to a woman who keeps the books and stuff and he has 3 kids and makes more money than I do who went to an Ivy League school. Smarts are not what life is built around.We need more people like that in this world We stan Ms. Lopez.Teachers should be just as appreciated as ambulance workers fire(wo)men and police officersTeachers dont want to be as appreciated as ambulance workers trust me.\s\sSource: am ambulance worker am not appreciated.\s\sAlso you can just say firefighter since thats the name of the position not fireman or woman.Who are all also underappreciatedIt's easily one of the most important jobs that exists and deserves so much more funding. I've been told by the right that it's a horrible return on investment. Which is ridiculous Just as appreciated as police officers? So you want people to hate all of them for no fucking reason?Depends. I have seen only like 3-4 teachers in whole life as student for 19 years who actually wanted to teach me something and I was one of those first benchers who actually listened in class did assignments and bothered to read the material in advance. May be if they were paid more they would care more but that’s just a guess and not an actual result of higher pay. Teachers should be appreciated way more than police officers. Teachers will never shoot your dog.Yeah but instead we get jipped by some “you’re being bullied but just deal with it” chair sitter-innerNot arguing with your point about authority figures could extended it to doctors cops lawyers etc.\s\sBut I'd say it needs to start with the parents more than anything.Is this a meme?Every school needs a person like thisHow in the fuck does this have upvotes Unlike my principal who gave me detention for telling a harmless joke""Society was built down around us""\s\sSociety made me deal drugs! Society made me steal and murder! How about we teach kids that when you get in trouble there are consequences for your actions instead of giving them an excuse to continue getting in trouble. She's inspiring a new generation of troublemakers. But he has a good on...It’s just Socioeconomic factors goy.Ms Lopez sounds like a saint. I feel that the problem is people mistake why they have power and why people should have authority. Its to help those around them not to make them support the authoritive figureWell said!!!How is this a meme? Did a reddit user just steal something from instagram???I think it’s a good idea not to use suspensions and detentions willy nilly. I think you get better results when you’re more cautious in your use of them. Suspensions are meant to protect the other kids from the ""problem"" kid. I don't know how much utility they'd have for a kid as young as this one appears to be. \s\sAnecdotally I got suspended a bunch of times in high school for dress code violations. I would like to apologize for the harm caused to my fellow students by being forced to see my exposed midriff.Love Ms. LopezI know this comment will most likely get buried but can someone explain who she’s referring to when she says “society was built down on us”? I'm not crying you're crying!Suspension is an ineffective method of discipline anyway. Right? Who sees a kid making bad decisions and thinks “yeah we should keep him OUT of school”What would you suggest happens instead?\sFor instance if kids are physically fighting what should the consequences be?Or you just don't break the rules. If a kid doesn't care this teacher is giving them a free pass.That's the type of educator I want to be.We need to teach so much more than just what the books say. Please be one the world needs you. Here’s a couple of books that will give you strategies to be a more effective educator especially with low-income students. Realistically the strategies are great for any kid as all kids can use some support and empathy from the adults in the lives.\s\s“Reading and Reaching Children Who Hurt” by Susan E. Craig - How to more effectively teach children who have experienced trauma (Adverse Childhood Experiences). His experience is the goal of the strategies given in the book. ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Reaching-Teaching-Children-Who-Hurt/dp/1557669740)) I haven’t read it but she also has two more recent books “Trauma Sensitive Schools” [K-5](https://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Sensitive-Schools-Communities-Transforming-Childrens/dp/0807757454) and [6-12](https://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Sensitive-Schools-Adolescent-Years-Resiliency-ebook/dp/B0762BHF7L/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1549140705&sr=1-3&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=Susan+E.+Craig&dpPl=1&dpID=51Jllg6S-qL&ref=plSrch) \s\s [Trauma Sensitive Schools: Approaches that Work](https://traumasensitiveschools.org) - A project by the Massachusetts Advocates for Children and Harvard Law School has free books (downloadable pdf). One focused on the background and the second is about implementing a school-wide approach. \s\s“Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria” by Dr. Beverly Tatum - Covers the theory of racial identity development and how to support positive racial identity in an educational setting. ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Kids-Sitting-Together-Cafeteria/dp/0465083617))\s\s[removed]I think the lesson should be both nature and nurture because it’s not as simple as you seem to think especially when it comes to poverty. Many unwanted behaviors can be explained and understood by someone’s upbringing and how that affects their mental health. \s\sAmerica’s long history of violence discrimination and imprisonment of blacks has resulted in some pretty shitty circumstances and growing up in poverty as a black kid can absolutely explain certain “bad” behaviors. Someone growing up in that environment is more likely to have low self-esteem for many reasons including the fact that their schools don’t get enough funding they are more likely to be abused there is no parent or leadership presence they don’t have access to nutritional food or nature etc. \s\sSo it’s important for children to have a leader who can explain that there are many societal systems which have evolved over the past few centuries and lead to the creation of poor predominantly black neighborhoods in every American inner city. \s\sHowever that doesn’t mean that people are absolved of personal responsibility. If anything it means that you need to grow up with more awareness of your actions since you are more likely to be negatively targeted for your appearance and the way you speak for example. \s\sSo of course it would be appropriate to teach these kids that their actions have consequences and then implement those consequences. The issue is that traditional punishments used in public schools just aren’t effective for behavioral issues. And unfortunately I have no idea which consequences would be best to prevent specific unwanted behaviors while also boosting confidence in the kids. \s\s\s\s[removed]Came here to see if anyone shared my same thought. Thank you. Growing up with a victim hood mentality is not good. It makes you distrust and even hate people. Everyone is born into different circumstances but everyone also has the freedom to improve their position in life. Kids need good role models and instilling things like this can be very counter productive. Let’s teach kids that hard work and discipline are the keys to success. i don't see it that way at all. she's telling the kids to not succumb to a system that's built against them; to not give up in the face of overwhelming circumstances. she's reminding them of their worth when others in their life may not.\s\sthese are good worthwhile lessons.\s\sedit: these downvotes are confusing me. are these not good lessons?*principal\s\s*Principle* typically relates to numbersHello!

\sI'm not crying!! Good. Tried saving the postAt the same time at some of these schools the kids don't care and almost always have a problem with authority figures.I don't think it's happening at this school and have you considered that it may be the parents causing that behavior? Kids don't tend to just not care and have problems with authority out of nowhereWhen you screw up it's because society is built up against you. Take no responsibility for yourself at allShe suspends the white kidsThese are reasons I became a teacher.💕Sorry but what Ms.Lopez is teaching her students  isnt true.\sShe shows the students that if they break the rules their is no punishment because they have a disadvantage in the society.\sThe problem is this only applys for her school but not for the life after school.Gotta love that most these redditors who are in love with the principle's actions haven't went to public schools in poor areas. It's not some fairy tale where these words of encouragement fix them there are legitimately shitty kids that really don't want to be at school and in turn ruin it for everyone else. Mostly fighting in the class/being completely loud an obnoxious/driving the teacher insane and making it at a complete burden for the kids that actually want to be at school to learn and move forward with life. But that's okay it's how society was built down around them they definitely don't need to be punished with suspensions to restore peace to the classroom.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sNot to mention the countless times where model students get corrupted by their peers or face getting shunned/bullied because they take their education far more serious then their friends.We need more teachers and principles like this. If everyone had educators this great just imagine where we could be nowMs. Lopez woke AFI have a pretty (somewhat) similar experience when I got into a fight at school. Well I say fight but I just punched the kid a bunch. I won’t go into the details of said fight but I wasn’t a bully or anything. He set me off. Anywho I wasn’t a city district kid I payed tuition and no tuition kid had ever stayed at that school after getting into a fight. My principal believed I was a good kid though so he said he would decide what to do after my two week suspension and asked that I write an email/letter on why he should let me stay. Well I did that and he did indeed let me stay without even having to go in front of the tribunal. Very grateful for his judgement that day.Ms lopez is a real oneWho's their principle? Tariq Nasheed? This world needs more everyday heroes like Ms. Lopez.\sThank you and always remember that you are appreciated!This is pretty old but the awesome news is [this resulted in raising over a million dollars for his school.](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_6604722)Because of this Humans of New York post his class all got to go to DC and meet Obama too. This article was such a pleasant read. Awesome story Hey Mr. Scott whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Make our dreams come true!holy crap thats nutsBro I'm crying rnWhy am I crying in the club rnKinda makes you upset though that the only way schools that need funding get said funding is through something going viral. Every school should get the same opportunities  I heard about a teacher doing this in one of my podcasts (but I feel like it may have been in the Bay area)- I wonder if this was her! It seems to be a really positive and effective way to explain our history of the incrimination tactics in the US. Damn this post made me want to cry and then I read your comment and now I really want to cry (good cry lol)It is odd that the government can’t provide enough funding for schools but plenty for slave labor prisons they traffic guns and traffic drugs. that’s some freedom writers shitAsian children doesn't get half the pampering yet they are still extradinarily successful academically. Maybe we need another approach with inner city children instead of lowering standards. Hard truths often affect the most change. More power to me Ms LopezI’m so so grateful there are people like this in the education system.  All kids need encouragement like this but I can’t imagine how impactful this kind of leadership could be for young black children or kids from low income areas who are too often deemed troublemakers. More of this please!But if a child frequently makes trouble shouldn’t they be deemed a troublemaker? It really doesn’t do any good to have no consequences for rule breaking. That is one cool principalI’m gonna disagree with this.  She told this kid that drop outs are destined for jail.  I get that that’s a motivational tool but she subconsciously telling kids that drop outs are pieces of shitCame here to say exactly this. Glad I’m not the only one to think about this. Like ok if school isn’t for you just go straight to jail. How wholesome. I work with prison offenders. This is good stuff.This is the best way to handle a child needing discipline!\s\sAbsolutely love this.Telling them they are a victim and not reprimanding them?Anybody else notice how the inside of his sweater looks really comfortable? [removed]This strawman is ***not wholesome***#canwegetsomerespectWeird my teachers just told me I wouldn't amount to anything.I’m sorry. People like that shouldn’t be teachers. I hope you didn’t listen to that and take it to heart. I believe in you! ❤️Actually that will produce much better and stronger people. Humans love challenges and proving people wrong. Holy crap that's Bryan Stanton's People of New York from 2017's PSATI don’t understand the no punishment thing though. If a child is acting out and getting into trouble (regardless of race) they should still be punished in some way like a referral or detention or something. It doesn’t really do much good to let kids run rampant with no consequences. meanwhile my school suspends people for having earbuds in during lunch I’ve never even met the principal in the 3 high schools I went to.Hell ya growing up with a victim complex will get you far lmao...[deleted]he was real thoStill amazes me how educators get paid less than their worth to society (imo).Unfortunately there are large sections of society that under value the worth of teachers and many other important professions.I like this sentence grammatically because it doesn't actually matter if you say ""their"" or ""they're""Yeah I think it'd be cool to be a teacher but it's just not a viable career path in the US.And that there are some awful educators out there who go their whole careers doing awful shit to their students with no repercussions.We get paid pretty well in Ontario and while wages are obviously always on the radar they’re definitely low on the priority list for us. We’re far more concerned with class sizes and teaching load. \s\sLess funding = bigger classes sizes = significantly less time available per student = less prep time = more marking time = etc. \s\sOur contract ends this year and the Ontario government still hasn’t responded to any requests from unions for contract negotiations for the coming year. The rumblings of canning full year kindergarten and increasing class sizes for kindergarten are an incredibly bad omen. \s\sI said it before the election and I’m saying it again now: the first thing the Conservative governments do is slash health and education funding. Keep the populace stupid and sick and you’ll rule forever. It’s going to happen this fall. Its mostly because administrative bloat. Money that should be going towards educators actually goes to The Assistant Business Manager in Charge of 1st Grade Pencils. Its horse shit.Worth and value are two different things my man[deleted]It's because there's a shitload of teachers.  It's an incredibly oversaturated market.\s\sAlso public sector doesn't pay shit regardless. Blame our government for refusing to pay good wages.Something I've always wondered are they really getting paid less than their worth? They only work 9 months of the year and still get a lot of benefits. Seems to be a decent enough gig. The majority of people are - work life is as it always has been: wage slavery. And we still think it's a good idea to suspend the bad kidsI know what you mean and I agree but technically everyone is paid less than they're worth (to someone whether it's society or a business) otherwise it wouldn't be profitable to hire them.I feel like once upon a time teaching was a well paid respected job and somehow the bank employees lawyers doctors and computer programmers pulled out ahead of teachers pay-wise and respect-wise.\s\sI was born in the 1970s. My dad was a teacher and my mom was a stay at home mom. My dad's income was able to support us all and they also sent all 4 of us kids to university. We weren't rich rich but we were more well off than a lot of people in our town. Remember that there is a serious investment by powerful people in this country to disparage and underfund public schools. One of the reasons educators are so poorly treated is the propaganda machine that includes fox news right wing (and some centralist) politicians  and other media outlets who have been saying teachers are actually overpaid and they don’t even work 3 months out of the year and a whole bunch of other bullshit. \s\sThe reason is simple: poorly educated populations are easier to control and easier to lie to. Its much harder to manipulate elections and pass legislation that harms the majority of Americans if the populace is well educated and informed.how to pray with authority\s\s&#x200B;The principal in my highschool told the boys that men rule the world. Then he told the girls that we can make the boys do whatever we want using our wiles. It's not illegal to tell kids this which is awesome.If I remember correctly Obama saw this post and invited the kid and Ms. Lopez to the White House.All of the feels At least 8 of the feels...That is some modern mister Rodgers shit. Telling children that they are valuable and important is a wonderful thing to do.How is this wholesome? She’s literally telling them they were destined to fail. She should promote responsibility not an excuse to use as a crutch.😇😇😇I just pictured her like oprah pointing at kids going ""YOU MATTER AND YOU MATTER! AND YOU AND YOU!!""O captain my captainGeez I wish this was the norm not the exception. [removed]I hopeMaybe im just emotional today but this nearly made me cry. Just like that.Reminds me of the principal in The Wire.  Chief of police rounded up all the street thugs and corner drug dealers and hauled them into the local school gymnasium.  Tried yelling at them they just yelled back he couldn't control shit.\s\sThen the principal comes out who recognizes all of them calls them out by name and they respect the shit out of her.  Not fear just respect.  I like Ms. Lopez to! We all matter no matter what someone may say about us. Our circumstances build us. Yeah and in this kid’s circumstance he was told he’s a victim and given no punishment. What do you think that will do to the kid?JESUS CHRIST! He is wearing a hoodie!! Someone shoot him\s\s\s\s\s/sYeeesh how did all those other comments get removed but not this one? I mean he easily could have had an rpg or something. I personally felt like my life was in danger so better safe than sorry ^^^^/sEvery school needs to have atleast one teacher like thatFake news What makes you say thatyea Im sure its that easy to get highschool kids from broken homes to suddenly get motivated and turn straight. ""Hey jimmy you matter"" omg it worked hes cured! \s\sMost of them will just laugh about it after.Hey you might be right maybe they do just laugh about it later. \s\sBut for someone who may have never been told something like that it leaves an impression. As someone who never received positive reinforcement growing up it's amazing how much difference a few words from someone who cares can make. Why are you even in this subreddit if that's how you feel about the world? If you're trying to make yourself a happier person this is not how to do it.Meanwhile my principal bitches if we don’t sit down in the cafeteria Society was built down around them? What? My history teacher tells us stuff like this but instead of motivating us he says that we’re the problem with society because we only care about fortnite and sex instead of our lord and saviour Jesus. wow. that made me tear up“It’s never your fault that you’re in trouble just blame it on society” is a shitty perspective to imbue someone with\s\sThe other stuff she said was pretty cool thoI came in to post about how NY voted to kill babies....\s\sBut I won't and I think she was making the point that society expects you to fail and maybe even wants you to.That boy is a star! [removed]This is good but a lot of the stuff on that page is not take HONY with a grain of salt. Fuck who’s cutting onions at work?!very nice but how is this a meme?Thats a principal that actually cares about the future generations I thought only white people make this face?no it just means he's ready for office work.. :/ its a general we're all stuck here face.This principal ensembles one way of being a leader of the next generation. What does she say when the white kids get called to her office?i hope everyone in the world gets to see this love you all.You rock miss Lopez 🤘🤘I'm not crying you're crying.Parents are responsible to teach the same message.I’m not crying. You’re crying!Huh. I was thinking for everyone education succeeds a jail cell is built. It's just in the shape of a cubicle a white picket fence and debt. Get out while you can. You might still have a chance to live a little.\s\s""...Then all Denmark's a prison...A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons.""My fourth grade teacher called me out in class and told me I wasn't special and would never get anywhere in life. I live in the heart of San Francisco and make almost $200000 a year. That doesn't matter as much as the fact that I've been through some horrific things in my life but I'm still here and have people who love me. Ms. Lopez is shaping the future. HONY did a follow up story on Ms. Lopez after this interview. She is incredibly impactful community leader it was wonderful to see her leadership. Happy this is recirculating!Lopez 2020I wish I met Ms. Lopez in my school time. I could have really used this kind of positivity and guidance. If anyone has any more interest in this story check out “Bridge to Brilliance”. It is a book written by the principal Nadia Lopez about her school and the kids in it. Very uplifting and a good read. It wasn't all that long ago when kids were being humiliated caned or struck on the hands with a ruler by their teachers. Happy to see that's all in the past but I can only imagine the psychological damage that was inflicted on young pliable minds.\s\sI remember back in Catholic primary school I was around 6-7 years old. The teacher singled me and another two boys out because we were struggling with our times tables. She stood us up in front of the class and made us try to recite them from memory. Obviously I couldn't do it and got stuck half way through the whole class laughed at me and she got her kicks. Humiliated I went home to my father and asked him for help with the homework. After a short while it was his turn to call me an idiot get angry and then leave the table.\s\sI still can't do my times tables ;/\s\s  Hey if you ever feel like learning them PM me. We can work on them together! I also struggled with them and was held back a grade because of it. I had teachers make jokes about how slow I was because I was always the last person to finish tests. I even had one teacher basically tell the whole class I was the only one who failed a math test.\s\sI'm so fucking glad I'm an adult now. i also grew up in a situation where society at large was telling me how special i was but my direct authority figures were constantly at their wits end with me. today i feel like myself and have built up my intelligence on my own terms but the fear of being stupid or oblivious to something is always in my mind. always. i have pretty terrible self confidence.There’s a fantastic lesser-known horror/supernatural book by Orson Scott Card called Lost Boys and in it one of the kids ends up in a class like this. The teacher basically hates him for some reason. After the father learns about this he confronts the teacher and it’s just *such* a satisfying scene for anyone who’s ever had a teacher like this. \s\sI asked him about it at a signing (this was before his brain broke and he became a foam-mouthed superpolitical jackhole) and he said that most of that whole arc was pretty much what actually happened to his family. He later described it as his “most autobiographical story.”\s\sMay all the gods bless the good teachers. Hey man I was never able to learn either!! It’s all good [removed]Exactly My old elementary school’s principal is racist. Which causes other kids to fear her instead of being influenced by her. Not trying to put any negative things here just trying to show the difference between people.Jail cell? Fuck right off this is bullshit you shouldn’t be teaching kids. Some kids actually see suspension as a social boost don’t get me wrong it’s not Kids ((in general) do not understand the implications of being suspended.I can honestly credit a lot of my upbringing or my decision making skills due to my Principal in Public school. She definitely made me think twice about everything I do. \s\s*tips hat* thank youThis isn’t wholesome at all. How they separated blacks and whites. Then took all the jobs and defunded their schools. It directly created the school to prison pipeline. The government the US government is responsible for that. And you all want to hand over your guns. Sounds like an amazing principal not enough kids especially those struggling to make it are told that they matter as an individual and it can be powerful. She definitely sounds like an amazing motivator and teacher she takes each infraction and makes it a learning opportunity. Everyone gets a trophy jeez these millennials [r/HumansofNewYork](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansofNewYork/?st=JRNWKDGS&sh=684a7aed) Instead of suspending students for breaking rules in schools we should be taking them on field trips during school to theme parks and buy them food and ice cream.My principals made up new rules so they could get more kids in trouble over random bullshit.And then everyone stood up and clapped...Might be unpopular but I don’t think telling childeren that failing school would make them end up in jail is true.You can tell the people who are criticizing this one quote are not helpful advice givers. If you're someone who gives good advice you know when to apply ""tough love"" vs. when to say ""it's not your fault"". As a kid who grew up in NYC schools I know Ms. Lopez also pushes these kids real hard to do the right thing in this particular instance she was showing the touch that we want all of our educators to have. I would hate to be one of y'all kids maybe that's why the average redditor has shit self esteem no one ever helped build you back up.I just tried to hit the heart and like that shit.It seems like my school is the complete opposite of this. They don't spend enough time on our education and are constantly polishing the detention systemI wish my schools worked like this. A few weeks ago I got myself into detention for being sarcastic.These comments are showing that people treats these kids like thugs before the children can even understand what that is. Lids are sponges and they will react to things the way they are taught to and take what people think of them to heart. She’s showing them they have a chance to do better and break the cycle. Whether you believe that society discriminates or not it is a great message for ALL children. Do better become better. That’s what she’s saying. What an incredible spirit! Inspirational! She's lying though.i don't use this work often but...cringe. This is not a meme. Over here trying to double click it to give this a heart and I'm on Reddit that's how deep this hit me.  Thought I was on Instagram even though I only opened it 5 seconds before.  Take my upvote for the love of this post take it.And then we he drives drunk and kills people. He can claim affluenza because he’s never received punishment from any of his mistakes. Genius!Something tells me the black kid going to public school in New York won’t be able to claim the affluenza defenseI'm not crying. IM NOT CRYING.I mean... dropping out doesn’t mean you go right to jail. Exaggerating to youth can also be dangerous since they’re still making sense of their world.Great I love when principals teach kids at an early age to blame society for their shortcomings and that negative actions won’t have consequences because it’s “the system’s fault.” [removed]*we live in a society***BOTTOM TEXT**Reminds me of the principal in The Wire.  Chief of police rounded up all the street thugs and corner drug dealers and hauled them into the local school gymnasium.  Tried yelling at them they just yelled back he couldn't control shit.\s\sThen the principal comes out who recognizes all of them calls them out by name and they respect the shit out of her.  Not fear just respect.  That made me tear up. Wow.I love her Make that women superintendent of schools...not just her distract but every single one.she sounds like a hero and we need more of her[removed]How did you take that from that message? If the outcome is to fix bad behaviour and that works I do not see how that approach is gonna be a bad thing?Her message is that when your black you are under more scrutiny so you need to behave even better than white people[removed]Ms. Lopez is clearly amazing but as a teacher a harsh truth we educators learn is that this stuff only works if the kid is willing to listen. Now there are lots of factors that affect if a kid is able to listen to and internalize this kind of stuff (homelife socio economic status etc) but there are kids who would hear that and then just laugh the second they leave the room.\s \sI’m absolutely not trying to downplay Ms. Lopez or this post but it’s a very hard lesson you learn as an educator. \s\sThe reason I’m pointing this out is because I don’t really like the “every teacher/principal/etc should be like this” mentality when there’s examples of amazing educators. It puts unfair pressure on other educators trying to do their best or have different methods and it also invalidates the fact that teaching is a long journey of constant reflection and self improvement. \s\s“Every ____ should be like this” makes it seem like it’s just a switch and not years of workExactly right.  This won't work in every situation.  And for some educators this strategy won't work at all.  Horses for courses.  There are no easy fixes.  *Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** victorysongs! ^(hug)This is so nice <3 As always you should try to help when you can and if someone is receptive to it.\s\sBut there are some lost causes.  That's just reality.  There's no amount of help that they'll take or use.[removed]what a bunch if fucking “deep” mumbo jumboThis is all well and good and probably one of the best ways to handle these things but there are also supposed to be consequences to actions. I wonder how the school does in that department. Every time I read this it gives me such a warmth feeling. I remember seeing this when it made it to a newspaper cover titled ‘A million dollar baby’ after the original post by HONY unleashed a massive fundraiser. I love wholesome memes but I don't think that if a student does something bad the principal should say ""it's alright society made you this way"". Like we need people to take responsibility for their actions. Not put blame on something else. \s\sPlease don't crucify me.""And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school a new jail cell gets built"".

\sAnd as with all things it's not just the quantity that matters. The quality is what truly shines.Am only worried about tishaltynn!He looks way more excited to be in the pictures as She does lolHoly shit. I remember when this happened. I can’t believe he actually flew to wherever the hell this girl is and did this! What a guy!This is the kind of publicity that nobody can buy his agent probably said was a waste of time and now twenty times as many people know who he is--all new fans most of whom will watch shows when they see he's in them.Man of his word I respect that a lot!Orestimba High School is sort of near Modesto / San Jose CA so unless he lives in that area it definitely was a trip he had to make. Unless she met him down in Los Angeles or something. Pretty awesome I’ve never seen an actor do something like this. Girl?  That chick looks to be in her mid 30s.I remember when it happened too 29 Oct 2017.🖒I didn’t know who he was but now David Harbour is one of my favorites. Demaris is seriously hot!!!’This is so good!Horrible hand position HarbourJim HopperShe looks 30+. [deleted]I'm guessing these are college senior photos. [deleted]Sad weekend?Riding someone's wave... SmhThe band need in me noticed his proper holding technique......I was late to the show but lived it . Every role is huge quailty . The kids are amazing actors Trombone nation represent![deleted]Things don’t get much stranger than this Respect your comment. There IS a lot of very scary things being said and done in the US (sorry I’m assuming from White House you mean MURICA) \s\sLocal votes are key but many don’t feel heard (maybe that’s changing idk) the majority of us are protesting calling or visiting our representatives and just good ole participating in our right to vote \s\sBut as a single Hispanic mother who is a teacher in my own school district I grew up in....and I feel/see the struggle everyday \s\sLet’s not bring down this happy photo session with political shit. I wished I had awkward pics and a shit prom. I absolutely LOVE it when I see celebs take time to awknowledge students bc they’re all my babies. From Texas to Cali to Florida to Maine idgaf. He brightened that girls life of only for a moment. Yes that’s a big reason I vote is to not only save my job but try to support these 200 to 300 kids of mine who just need someone ANYONE to say you’re awesome and you matter \s\sThis isn’t a distraction it’s a celebration of life and how teacher parent or even a celebrity taking a moment out of your busy life to make someone feel special is heartwarming. ❤️❤️  \s\s(Also sorry if you were making a joke or reference and it over my head) and I’m kind of upset he didn’t go FULL band uniform. Like feather hat and them big gold button official uniforms lolDid he play ice god of Hungary on the trombone?That's awesome for him to do.This guys is awesomeIt's really hard to dislike him. I mean I'm not trying but I imagine if I were to try it would be **really** hard.Bitchin'This is so amazing. I love him. [deleted]According to r/strangerthings David Harbour used to play trombone when he was younger despite holding it weirdly in this picture.Username checks out.Username checks out!Is this not the guy from epic meal timeThe pom poms got meI thought he was charging $25000 to get a school pic with him and was wondering what makes that plenty of good haha.I want him to be my father! Just adopt me right up!You just need to have telepathic powers and bleed from your nose whenever you use them. Sooo...is she single? Asking for...me.Not a meme but definitely wholesomeSlide grease saves relationships lolDid he fly to Canada for this? School looks like Laurier or Waterloo Nope. Newman CA. 'Orestimba Warriors' is what the shirt appears to say Google says that is in California.I needed to wake up to thisWhat a cool dude! Hats off to being down to earth!Who is he?  He's sexyActor plays one of the main roles in stranger things. OMFGI respect the same expression in 5/9 photos He is an absolute treasure.awesome...I had that exact brand of trombone at high schoolIt's great how she looks like she's about to break out into laughter in every picture!Gotta love a man that keeps his promises.She’s at least 30!\sit's worth fighting for Mr. FrodoSo if I understand your title OP a celebrity taking pictures with a fan is some kind of higher good in your mind?[deleted][deleted]she looks 35 how is she still in highschool Miranda already looks Hispanic thoughMixed with Deb from Dexterhttps://imgur.com/59vVRpUThanks you just caused me to actively search for iCarly and Dan Schneider related subredditsHe delivers again!!!!He is *nothing* like Papa.Senior in high school? I remember HS senior looking a lot younger 30 years ago. She looks between 25-40 years old. Yes but she is very pretty!!Not to brag but I used to go to the same coffee shop in the east village as David Harbour and he was the most polite respectful generous friendly person in the entire shop. I read this 4 tines backwards confused as fuck before I realizedAs a trombone player this makes me happy. Dude paid up. Respect. I saw this on his twitter ages ago - the rest of the Stranger Things cast were retweeting it left right and centre. So glad he actually did it! ""ages ago""\s\sOctober 29th 2017\s\swhat.The entire Stranger Things cast is pure gold. What an absolute legendwhere is the meme in this exactly?Where people share the photo virally. Isn't this the guy who used an award acceptance speech to encourage violence against his political opponents?This is too wholesomeAnyone else thinks she looks a lot older? Could easily pass for like 27Exams man examsI thought it was his wife before looking closelyI saw the pictures first before the tweet and I honestly thought she was in her late 20s or early 30s.Yeah that doesn't look like a high school student at all.Yeah I had to do a double take after I read ""senior pictures"" I always found that americans look older than they are.College senior photos probably. If she came into a bar I wouldn't have carded her. Still look at him like a creepy serial killer from a walk among tombstonesI love the obnoxious dad/annoyed daughter dynamic in some of the pictures.This guy is amazing. Gotta respect a man who keeps his word.U/greenetangerineWhy the fuck does she look 50I don't know anything about him outside of his Stranger Things role but for him to do this for a fan makes him a good dude in my book. The inclusion of the trombone is hilarious.He was fantastic in The Newsroom.Also had her and her family stay at a nice hotel in LA before they all got to meet him pretty cool of him.He's in Quantum of Solace.All I know of him outside ST is he wants to punch some people in the face. This is nice though.> The inclusion of the trombone is hilarious.\s\sI'm looking at how he's holding it and he holds it the right way for playing. I wonder if he plays/played trombone at some point. Playing devil's advocate.....wouldn't we all be a bit nicer if we were rich and had a job that afforded us a fair bit of free time i know for sure i would be.\s\sEdit: seconds after posting it dawned on me lots of people are in his line of work and are still douchebags so actually well done.He's a really cool dude. I'd love to have a beer with himAlso a crooked cop in The equilizer.that's where I recognize him from! he legit looks like a trombone player I know from collegeHe is also going to be the new hellboy FACT: Stranger things have happened!this made me do a smileit would be wholesome if he answered 0 tweetsWho is David Harbour?Stranger Things The Newsroom.\s\sUpcoming Hellboy. [deleted]Jesus this guy is just so damned **likeable**!!Can't wait to see him in hellboy Pretty dick move to call dibs on the trombone thohttps://youtu.be/tKdcjJoXeEY""Punch some people in the face"" What a handsome girl. Dem cheekbonesThey look great together. Yeah and that shirt Who is that dude?He plays the sheriff in Stranger Things. Stuff like this always reminds me of a nice quote I saw online ""if you turn off your TV and go talk to your neighbors you will find out the world isn't as terrible of a place as everyone thinks it is""Until your neighbor brings up politics :(I like how his condition is that he GETS to wear the sweatshirt and trombone. Like it's for him.I wonder if he played trombone in high school?""Haha I totally screwed her over!""Trombone player here. Came for the trombone stayed for the wholesomeness.Trombones are the shit... No idea 2ho he is but I'm honored as an ex trombone player to see a trombone in a senior picture. It's like he was prepared for this already and had a list of conditions already prepared.Note to self: always have a list of conditions and be absurdly particular. Just browsed her twitter feed and I don’t see any indication that this was faked. She looks like she pays taxes been married twice and has a mortgageThis is pure unadulterated goodness. I love it. Wow. Their sweatshirts are so clean. I wonder how they achieved that.This man is a treasure to the world.This is gonna be the pinnacle of this girls life ! All down hill from here lol Dick\sDoes he play trombone or did he just want a prop? They both look awesome in these pics glad they had fun.This is so ducking good 🙏Good on a picture on the internet with text with it\s\sThat's your definition of goodShe looks old AF. I'm probably going to frame this and put it on my wall just so people ask questions [removed]Well. This seems to break the rules. Who pissed in your cereals this morning jeez What a nice guy.oldest high schooler ive ever seenThe only thing I can think of is the fact that my school suspends anyone who wears ripped jeans Tide Ad?You did good kid I'm out of the loop. Did she win a contest?No read the tweets at the top. She got over 26k and he was true to his word :)I guess you could say stranger things have happened beforeOK I just fell in loveThat's nice of him. 👍Wow. Celebrities need to do more of this You can see how happy this made the girl by looking at her smile. She can’t hold in her excitement!I love him so much.  He also plays Shep in Revolutionary Road one of the most depressing movies of all time. He broke my heart in that but I have such a crush on him now especially since he actually seems like a real life decent human.

He was a little better than me and had an MLG gamertag.  I was like great here comes the shit talking.  But no he messaged me to say the round was a total blast and thanked me.M: Major\s\s\sL:League \s\s\sG;GenuineI found a guy in the Dark Zone in The Division who actually wanted to cooperate and get loot together which was rare.  No mics.  We were doing good but at one point had to run away from some other guys.  I thought we got separated and I turned around and some dude was chasing me.  Without hesitation I unloaded into him and killed him.  But it turns out it wasn't somebody chasing me.  It was my coop buddy and I gunned him down in cold blood.\s\sWas a long time ago and I still think about it to this day.True gamerAaah that‘s what I really enjoyed in Dark Souls as well. \s\sThere was always intense excitement when you found somebody that was actually on the same level as you. (as in it is a „fair game“.)Eyes up guardianD1 rumble was the best. Those games like you described when you and another are top 2 by far and it’s super tense who will get the 25 first. Had a few like that and ended up adding the other after that.If the tag was just “abstract” it was me and gg!    this is what happens when you recruit spartans from canada.Hello I'm a Spartan from Canada 👋🇨🇦Thinking that their avatar is the person who wrote it (a badass spartan) makes this really funny for some reasong(old)players like this deserve the best lifeThis is inspiring I'mma stop teabaggingMost wholesome assassin ever!I completely obliterated a guy in Fifa 18 won 12-0. The player I was playing against sent me the most unexpected message ""thanks for playing with me buddy"". I added him to my friends list for being humble and recognizing it was merely a videogame. I wish more people were like him.Yeah I really only play botw and Minecraft creative. What’s teabagging?Using the kneeling or crouching movements of your character then standing over a defeated opponent which crudely mimics placing male testicles on them. In the bedroom such an act is known as ""teabagging"".I been there before. I can definitely relateI learnt my friends address and sent him a hand written letter that was calling him “a bitch ass little shit” because he stole the stuff from my minecraft chestI've been out of the online gaming world since ~2010 so I may be a bit out of touch but please tell me that his reasoning was for actually feeling bad about being a bit douchy and not because Microshit considers teabagging as bullying or some shit.Meanwhile my username is ThunderousteabagSpeech 100That is literally me apologizing for everything 😂😅I had someone t bag me the other day so I then spent the rest of the game hunting that guy down murdering and t bagging him. He messaged me after and said “reported bitch”. This was on xbox so I reported his message and he got a nice communication ban. Dont start shit you cant finishin the first half... i’m gonna lie.There should be a wholesome gamers subreddit bc our gaming community is toxic af sometimes and we need better examples of gamers to balance that shit out.r/wholesomegamersPerfectly balanced as all things should beClassy afBULLSHIT !!\s\sNOBODY DOGES BULLETS IN HALO...you just take em to the chest and deal with it.Like a man.EEEEEK I USED TO KNOW THIS GUY I THINK?This reminds me of a time whenever fortnite first came out and a guy who was sitting in a bush killed me and I sent him a pretty mean message and he responded with something like “well I haven’t won yet and just want to win my first game” and I felt so badI can barely believe it.Halo fans vs cod fansCanadianAh so that explains the turd you dropped in my mouth.We need more people like this in the world if we did there would be world peaceNot all heroes wear capes.Had I known all the times I was nice to strangers online I could’ve gotten 30k karma oof I’ve made mistakes.I got two thousand Karma actually but still now u can be Cash Money.lolGrifballAw people are to innocent these daysHow is this wholesome this is sarcasm if I’ve ever seen it “ oh yeah sorry it looked like I was putting my balls in your mouth I was just tryin to dodge bullets”Have u ever played halo?

He was actually young (you can probably tell from the message) but I was like 16 andso tbh it was kind of boring.\s\sThe last thing I heard his mom say was ""why are you playing with a man"".Probably one of the sweetest messages I have ever read.it's called tactical crouchingOne Word: Fucking Adorablehe might have been trolling otherwise it was politeI don’t think he was trolling he’s a little kid I don’t think he would go through all that trouble just for a “joke”Friend that personI sure did.r/gamersbeingbrosLolWhat a gentlemanThe use of “assassinated” and the period tooI was pretty nasty at FIFA for a while but I quit playing because it was just not enjoyable for me. I usually still get it way later in the year when it's dirt cheap and I like to just casually play online matches very rarely.\s\sI always feel bad in Divisions though because I'm a Div 1 player matched with Div 10 guys or whatever. So I try to send messages to people I play either at HT to give them a tip on what I'm seeing and targeting or after the match to compliment some aspect of their game (as long as they weren't assholes) and give some advice as to what they can do immediately to see an improvement (versus something more involved like learning formations and tactics and using them situationally). I also always make sure to send a message after I lose to anyone saying ""Great match"" or whatever.\s\sIt's led to a lot of awesome responses and interactions with players of all skill levels. I do it because I was burnt out on the constant aggression and whatnot when I quit and a little bit of humanity like in this post tends to be the difference between ""this guy's an asshole"" or ""damn he's just really good and clearly not meant to play in this division so I shouldn't be too bothered"".""Report message"" as too sweet <3Not all Xbox players are saltyTeabag is always intentionalAW!Caboose 100YeetWholesomeGreat sportsmanship. A lost art...A CanadianI know this guy he’s the nicest guy onlineSound like a perfect example for r/accidentalteabagKiller whales are known to be stand up mammalsThere one guy I absolutely hate playing with in BF4. He always hides in the highest and/or farthest point on the map and always has SCAR-H except in Zavod map where he uses Saiga. Once asked him to pick something else and on the next map he replied to me ""oh look I have a different gun"" (no exact quote). Map was Zavod and gun was SaigaSo many upvotesGood orcaWait people do that as something else as a joke? I learned about tea bagging like thats an immature jokeSometimes people who suck at gaming (on the slight chance that they get a kill) they would hone the opportunity and T-Bag u. To prove their “dominance”Remember seeing this on 9GAG 2 years ago maybe 3Whats 9gagjust commenting to make it reach 666 commentshow did tbagging go from an essential part of multiplayer to a virtual hate crime i still dont get. Lot of people say well kids play these games yeah well if you're letting a kid play a game that's rated 17 plus you kind of have no argument thereI am so proud of this community*flash backs to playing ctf and having team members waiting for the flag carrier at spawn only to kill them so they can return the flag*So BeautifulI live halo so muchI got called ""biggest n00b on teh world"" which was the nicest message I ever had.*\sTactical crouching*What a good personLmaoDon’t know why but I want a bananaCanada 100Huzzah! A man of quality!Was playing gambit in destiny 2 and this dude kept invading and me and him would get into intense fight where one of us would just barely get the kill and when me and my team just barely one he added me to a group chat and I audibly said ""great another hate messsge"" bet he then asked me to queue up with him and now me and him are good friends101 or in english lolThat’s how you know they’re not 14Some folks are gentleman before they even know what it means to be one.This is really not entirely true though I've met so many fair younger players in Apex Legends. I even won a match with like a 10 yr old. He was so fucking cute always getting scared of being attacked. But when we won he thanked us for carrying and told us we were great. Truly wholesome. :')I got a message chatting shit to me over FIFA so I told this kid his dad had loins he then told me my dad has a hairline like Bas Dost quality response!I imagine hired killers sending this message to the families of people they killedRespecc 100Such a polite killer.This is proof there are still gentlemen in the worldReported... For commendations.This is just the cutest!Make this a sub rslash gamersbeingbrosSpeech 100Wow what a reeeeeally nice person.Aw memories me and this guy on Destiny 1 got in a fight over tea bagging. I thought he tea bagged me so i sought revenge and tea bagged him. He too sought revenge. At the end of the match he messaged me angrily and I called him out on starting it. Turns out he was actually having trouble getting his dodge ability to work and it’s mapped to the crouch key. The initial teabag was a complete accident. We partied up and started hunting people who were purposely tea bagging others and serving them teabag justice! In the hypocritical form of tea baggingI added him ;(r/blessedimagesRepeat offender'Tis but assassin's etiquette.\s\sAs counterproductive as it may seem.True Assasins understandThis is a genuine person irl too i betI’d assume I mean he went out of his way to tell the guy he’s sorry about T’bagging.\s\sThat’s a gentleman.I once got a message of a really close game where it was basically me and 1 other guy going at it and he ended up winning but messaged me saying ""sorry about your teammates"" even though his were also really bad. We ended being friends a few weeks later after playing with each other.How long have you been married?Lol either that could have been me or i had a really similar situationxbox 360 kids: 0\s\sxbox 1 kids: 1000Canada 100But what about the other persons head‘Report Message’Too kind to be true.The man has classLove the auto generated name and how well it goes with the messageDespite your assumption I actually used my Noggin for the caption.This is the first time l've ever seen anything positive from the Xbox messagesI was playing rainbow six and got fuckin obliterated by the enemy team  one of them invited me to their party and now we’re friends**CANADIAN 100**This is a very professional stance in the gaming world. 👏👏👏I recently had a guy apologize for calling me trash in CoD 3 years ago. I was pleasantly surprisedSurprising for Call of Duty.I once received a message in Dead By Daylight that said: “If it looked like I was teabagging you it’s because I was.”They had usI got facecamped once and they sent me a message saying ""could you smell my breath""After playing both league and DbD I can honestly say league is far tamer compared to the toxic cesspool that’s Dead by Daylight.I have one that was less funny but I still feel kind of proud of for coming up with to a degree. This one guy killed all my friends but I just barely escaped through the hatch and survived the match. After the round ended I messaged him saying: “You missed a spot bitch lol”. \s\sI thought it was funny at the time.Its dbd what did you expectI don't know if you're messing around or not but I got a true story \sI beat a guy on UFC 2 a few times in a row he started cursing and messaged me some nasty misspelled words I asked him if it was accidental he then responded with ""No  you a bitchass i meant it."" \sI completed my question with  ""Was it accidental from the fact that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table Mankind  was taken to your mom's office in the city's hospital which caused her to receive his mandible claw  mandible dick and a friendly mr. socko  finale which ultimately caused your birth within a getto home that harmonizes with your illiteral ugly-face   incompetent lackluster created character?"" \s\sThe Canadian sent me a friend request and an apology.As a survivor main I can only say “Sorry not sorry”.

My memory of the names of the places are foggy but I remember trying to run solo through Emain Macha (a PVP area) and I kept getting killed again and again by other players. After something like my fifth try I accidentally got too close to some mobs which if they caught me would have one shot me.  A group of enemy players rescued me and escorted me through the zone defending me against the other faction (can't remember the names of the factions but there were three) and some other mobs until I was in range of a group of players from my own faction and was therefore ""safe"".\s\sI remember posting about it in the forums and on my server and several guilds started making regular runs through the PVP areas defending solo enemy players (particularly low level players). The idea was that it was much more satisfying and fun to protect an enemy than to gank one.I do that every once in a while too cause I absolutely hate tea-baggers because 80% of the time it wasn’t even that good of a kill like “got him with dynamite I’m definitely carrying this team by killing that noob” so I like to extend the courtesy that no I was not teabagging I just don’t like having the lowest K/D ratio on the team.I do this all the time while racing in forza I crash this shit outta someone then message saying sorry my controller died.REeeTyped all out on a controllerI feel like this guy is a Canadian.I was teaming with someone in an FFA mode (don't worry it's allowed) and I accidentally killed them.

I kept killing this one player because I was just messing around in the game world and was sent a message by them asking if I could please stop because they were trying to get a trophy. I immediately felt bad and stopped and then began protecting them from any other players who were trying to kill them.\s\sEdit: thank you for my first gold!You sir turned from a Grim Reaper to a Guardian Angel real quickI had a guy crush my fleet in Ogame back in '05 and the small fight resulted in me gettimg a relatively small moon (from the debris etc.).

\sI am a creature of habit. I don't like new things in an unfamiliar environment I'm very set in where I do my shopping that sort of thing. Every day on my way in to work I stop by the same convenience store to get a drink a bag of chips and sometimes a peanut butter cookie from that ""Grandma's"" brand. This has been an ongoing thing since I was promoted to another department with normal working hours probably for about the past two years. The same person is usually at the register. She's an African American woman who is often on a bluetooth headset having a conversation with someone in a language I don't understand it sounds African she may be an immigrant. All I really know is that even with the language barrier that whomever she is speaking to is someone she cares deeply for with all of her soul. \s\sAnyway I took vacation last year. Vacation for me is a week of not leaving my home playing with my cat getting some cleaning done and probably playing a crap ton of video games. I came back the next week and when I got to the register I found myself being chastised because she did not see me all last week.\s\sI was very taken back and it was a feeling that I'm not used to experiencing. I don't think a lot of myself in fact I think incredibly poorly of myself and in general consider myself a bad person for the thoughts I have sometimes. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder if my mother and others would be better off just having the insurance money from my death. It was.. foreign to me that someone noticed I wasn't around. I've often assumed that if I died in my sleep it would be a couple of days before someone realized something had happened to me. \s\sBut no... the kind woman with her bluetooth headset who always has my items bagged by the time I've swiped my card notices it if I don't come in at my usual time. And what's funny is that when she isn't there I find myself annoyed with whomever is at the register because I have to ask them to do things she just does as part of her job to make her day better for her customers. I couldn't tell you anything about her other than that she has a genuinely kind smile and has very lively conversations in a language I can't understand with someone whom she loves very much and that somehow this person telling me to have a good day makes me feel like any other person in the world: the people I find myself wishing I was.People care.\s\sI don't know you and I'm a grown ass adult who just had a tear come to my eye while reading this.\s\sGood luck stranger. Hey. I know how you feel. Brutal feeling for sure. People do care though. Life is just busy.\s\s\sI had a total implosion from this feeling once. I was like 6 months single out of an 8 year relationship and in a city where literally all of my friends I hung out with regularly were her family members (brothers cousins) so I was suddenly just alone. They still loved me or whatever but it was awkward so we just cut ties. \s\s\sI was finishing my degree so I just did math all day and worked in a kitchen all night. I had supported her through her school and she was supposed to do the same for me but that didn’t happen. As a consequence I didn’t really have time to branch out socially while finishing my degree as I had to work to put myself through school. Outside of work talk in the kitchen the only people I spoke to were bus drivers baristas and the girl who scanned my pass at my gym every day. I wasn’t really conscious of this though I was just going through the motions.\s\s\sOne day while doing math alone in my room I had this crazy moment that came totally out of nowhere. I mean I was so focused on my school work I wasn’t thinking about my life at all but my brain suddenly on its own switched gears completely and I realized all at once I couldn’t remember the last time someone was happy to see me. I just felt this deep aching loneliness and broke down crying. It was so weird I didn’t know all that empty was there until then. It showed me how important a social life can be for people. I didn’t realize it until I felt it’s absence but I think a feeling of belonging in a intimate community like a tribe is deeply important to a healthy and fulfilling life.That s beautiful and sad. May I offer a suggestion? Ask her what language she's speaking.\s\sYou might do nothing more than that. You might have a short conversation. Find out some interesting things about where she's from. Or just chat about the weather. Connecting to another human especially someone who noticed you exist can be very powerful when you feel bad. Hey there internet stranger I don't know you but you matter to me too (✿◠‿◠)Want to seriously change your world?  Tell her how much that little interaction of hers meant to you.  Its astonishing how people will just open when you do that.\sI made someone in my class realise a similar thing. She's a genuinely wonderful person. Warms a room by being herself and has helped me through some dark stuff. But before we started talking properly I got her on Facebook and next day I noticed that again she had come in late and that she didn't hang around at lunch. When I messaged her about it she spent 15 min asking how I noticed. That was when I realised how little she thought of herself and made a promise to show her the person we all see which is so amazing is the real her. And that she's looking at herself with a negative bias. Reading your story gave me more hope that I can succeed in that task incidentally she is trying to do the same thing for me.[Well then....](https://i.imgur.com/iPEFV7c.gif)Ya got me all teary eyed over here. You sound like me. I have a bus driver that knew I was always running to the bus and he’d see me across the street and give me he thumbs up like I see you I’m waiting for your late ass and it seriously just made me feel like maybe I am seen. Maybe someone sees me!! And they’re gonna wait for me. Anyway I feel you. These moments you share can really keep you going. It’s real nice to be seen.Not right now but I have definitely spent times of life where I wondered ‘if I slipped in the shower and died how long would it be before anyone actually came looking for me?  Work would just fire me and classes would just assume I dropped out.’  Cities can be very lonely places.If you fall so you cover the drain and you live in an apartment it might only be a matter of hours before they break down the door/use a master key to come see what's causing the flooding/water damage.\s\sWeird work that they wouldn't at least call after you first not that that would help of course. Definitely understandable that they wouldn't file a missing persons report.\s\sSorry to be so dark. :/ You probably do have people even if they're ""only"" familiar strangers who would miss you if you died.This makes me think of when you're on a long road trip and you drive a stretch of 50-100 miles with the same car/s and then you or one of them gets off at an exit.\s\sFarewell fellow traveler. Male nurse who took the 2 o'clock bus every Friday 5 years ago I hope you are doing well.I work at a gas station and it’s amazing. All of the morning regulars know each other just from coming into the gas station for coffee and cigarettes in the morning. They chat while they make their coffees and tell each other to have a good one before they leave. Sometimes they even buy each other’s coffee or pop. They don’t know each other from anywhere else but the gas station. It’s wonderful. Mornings are my favorite parts of working midnights. I work at a grocery store and mornings are the best!Yeah I have a similar situation except I work the overnight at the gas station and that’s when the crackheads show up to buy their glass roses and chore bores. It’s truly touching the way they yell at me when the prices on their cigarettes go up as if I had anything to do with the change. It really is beautifully odd.  I have a clockwork schedule in the AM and for the last ~two years when I stop at the gas station this older retired guy is getting coffee at the same time.  With no more interaction than small-talk waiting in line it's eventually morphed into him giving me a fist-bump practically every morning and some variation of 'Give 'em hell today kid'.  He's like my morning hypeman.I have placements as part of my training that last 6 weeks at a time. Just enough to develop familiar strangers and have them torn away when I start somewhere new. 💔We all just gonna ignore that profile pic? AlrightI have a similar story. \s\sBack in college one of my classes I sat next to this one kid who was foreign he was Marshallese. Anyways he would always get there before me and he always had his stuff on my desk. And he’d move it when I eventually got there. It got annoying after a couple of weeks. And it was too late to find a new seat because while we didn’t have assigned seats everybody kind of sat in the same spot everyday so there were no open seats. So I just dealt with it. We didn’t talk much if at all. But he’d do it everyday. Have his stuff all over my desk and when I’d sit down he moved it to his desk. \s\sThen one day I walk in I was later than usual and some girl tries to sit where I usually sit. Next to this Marshallese guy. And the guy says “sorry this seat is saved” . I come over and he goes “hey Daniel i saved you a seat”. I felt like an ass thinking he was just being inconsiderate putting his shit on my desk he was making sure no one would sit in my seat. I talked to him more after that. I did that in college too. I’m a non-traditional student (aka old when compared to the 18-22yo) and I noticed these two girls that had to basically sprint across campus to get to our class and they really wanted to do well so they wanted good seats for the lecture but it was just hard to get them because they would barely make it to class on time. They didn’t know I heard their laments nor did they know that was my first class of the day so I could get there whenever I wanted.\sThe next class they sprinted towards the front before looking dejected because everything was taken. I motioned for them to come over and moved my stuff. The rest of the semester I saved seats for them and I think we only ever said “Thanks” and “no problem” to each other. I’d do it again in a heartbeat. “We still don’t talk to each other sometimes. Best friend I ever had!”I once worked with a guy for 3 years and never learned his name.  Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.So no ones gonna mention the thicc trump profile pic?Wholesome travelling friendsThere was an older black man who was a sign holder for a phone company a few blocks from my house who id trade a wave with for years. I was known as the “the surfer white boy with the music” around my area because of my 3x 12’s crammed in my small 2002 civic trunk and a 14 ft paddleboard that was almost always strapped to the roof ([for reference on how silly it looked](https://m.imgur.com/90igr6y)). I was a social worker and paddleboarded every day after or before work for 1 year straight so often times I’d just leave it strapped on my roof.  \s You could hear me coming from a while down the street so he was always ready to throw me a slick “you da man” finger point and I’d return em. I went to California for 3 weeks to visit my dad after I finished my AmeriCorp term earlier (had 3 weeks paid vacation) and upon returning finally met him one day at the store. He thought id been attacked by a shark or drowned and was worried about me was a pretty eye opening moment that someone who didn’t know me could feel any feelings towards me.A good friend of mine and I went to the same university and worked upstairs there at our internships together. On our lunch breaks every now and then we would walk downtown and grab sushi to go. The same girl behind the counter was  always there to take our order. The more we got sushi the more she would accommodate us with free tea a friendly smile a more casual attitude etc. I ended up graduating a semester early and moved to Alaska. My friend told me that after I left the girl asked her once in shy broken English “Where is your friend?” \s\sThat was the only time I had ever heard of her saying more than two words.\s\s6 months later I visited town and my friend and I  decided to go back there for old times sake. When she saw us walk in together the girl’s face lit up and she yelled “Together again!”\s\sI still have no idea what her name is or if I’ll ever see her again but I miss her in a weird way.It's weird how I only need to see people's faces once and even after 4 years without seeing them I would know them but never talked to them not even once.There was like a 40-50 yr old dude who'd sit beside me on the bus every morning...(for context bus has 2 rows of 2 seats back to back) and id much rather put my bag on the seat beside me if no1 is sitting there.\s\sbut no ..like im pretty sure there aer empty seats but he'd scour the bus for me and sit beside me every..single..morning.\s\sI now catch the bus 30 mins earlier just to avoid himThis is a thing. It's called familiar strangers.\s\sFrom Wikipedia: Familiar stranger...\s\s"" *A familiar stranger is an individual who is recognized by another from regularly sharing a common physical space such as a street or bus stop but with whom one does not interact. First identified by Stanley Milgram in the 1972 paper The Familiar Stranger: An Aspect of Urban Anonymity* ""\s\s*I Would like to thank you all and express my thanks that my anal warts comments were overrated.I have about a half dozen people I regularly see at my home station or who get off at the same part of the platform in the city as me. I don't know their names. We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down I'll go to war for them.I had tons of these when I lived downtown in a large urban center. This one dude and I had almost the exact same sleep schedule and our dogs had synchronized bladders. Almost every night I’d be across the street with my dog and I’d look up and he’d be kitty corner away from me with his corgi.\s\sOur dogs always and without fail would scream at each other but for whatever reason he and I never interacted. We’d kind of exchange sheepish looks while our dogs barked their faces off and then we’d each haul them away in opposite directions.\s\sThe song and dance went on for almost two years and then I moved. I hope he’s well. A Swanson familiar. \s\s\s“I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.”When I studied in Europe I'd pass the same prostitute in her van every afternoon. I never did more than say a hello as I'd walk by. I was going to wish her well on my last day before leaving but I forgot she doesn't park in her usual spot on the weekend. I wonder if she ever wondered about me and why I disappeared.[deleted]Milgram made several interesting studies. Apart from the one you mentioned and the famous Milgram experiment he also examined the six degrees of separation theory.\s\sEdit: now that I think about it several sounds like a lot but he did some interesting experiments.I have placements as part of my training that last 6 weeks at a time. Just enough to develop familiar strangers and have them torn away when I start somewhere new. 💔In public I couldn't be chillier. \s\s*He'll miss me? Man I've grown sillier.*\s\sBut he said he missed me\s\sIt felt like he kissed me\s\sNot friends but this stranger's familiar. This is my morning gym crew. Theres a core like 10ish of us and another 10-15 that are seasonal and always change. But the core 10ish of us..no idea who they are but we’re the everyday 6am crewNeat I like thisIn my way to school i always see the blue hoodie man the bicycle guy 2 to 4 dogs and sometimes the red hoodie guy.Screw this.  That guy in the black Tahoe and the woman in the little silver car I see in the drive thru line at McDonalds almost every single day....Monday morning they are gonna know my name and breakfast is on me.  (unless they are ordering one of those McCafe things that backs the damn line up.  Focus people one biscuit one regular drink per person.  You want to get fancy walk your ass inside.)\sI don’t know if this has already been mentioned but it reminds me of this a bit: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/7rDjDThis is crazy. I've always wanted to know if there was a name for this concept.  \s\sLike at my gym I probably have 150 familiar strangers where I don't know them personally I don't even know their names I never talk to any of them but I have a feeling like we all know each other type of thing I feel comfortable around them because I'm just used to their familiar energies and their presence.  \s\sThank you for finding an actual term for what I've been experiencing for years.I had this with a lot of people in my gym a couple years ago. One of the reasons it's so hard to pick it back up is that I've got social anxiety and now I don't recognize anyone there anymore.I like the word “propinquity” Which before the internets was how couples mostly ended up together. Propinquity. If I see somebody every day I start saying hi after a while or at least hit em with the nod of acknowledgement upon seeing them. I saw this guy in a early 2000s Audi A4 on the road everyday coming home from work. I rode my motorcycle everyday. I noticed him so I started waving at him. After a while he started waving back. So I start doing crazier things like pointing at him doing like the anime double peace signs to him even standing on my pegs and waving to him. He started doing his things too. Almost a year this goes on then I got transferred. That poor guy probably thinks I died in a wreck or something.  I’m still alive Audi bro.I had something similar happen to me except a little different.\s\sI used to commute to West side of Los Angeles on my motorcycle everyday for 5 years. It's one of the hardest rides to do because its two hours a day in what I explain to people as two cheese graters setup and look down the middle thats what splitting LA traffic is like and I would always spot the same brown Mercury Grand Marquis more of that old woman gold color. I would see this same car going almost the identical route as me and would catch her car in traffic from time to time. So after doing this commute and occasionally we would wave at each other and one time I stopped at a light on my way home before getting on the free way to see her right next to me. I opened my helmet a bit and said ""Hi I'm gotfondue I always see you in traffic!"" She smiled and laughed and said ""yeah me too! small world!""\s\sAfter a bit of time passed I ended up getting a new job but never really saw her after that. Until 3 years later at my new job which is down the street from my house I saw her car in the parking lot. Now you're probably asking how I knew it was her car she had a very distinct licenses plate that stuck in my head. So I left her a note to call me since I was the random motorcycle guy in traffic. Sure enough I got a call from her and we had a good hour long conversation about what we were doing and all that jazz. She said to me ""I am so glad I found out you're not dead! I would tell my husband 'I wonder if that guy that I saw in traffic finally died' so I am really glad you're not dead!""\s\sReally made me smile! That was all.This made me smile. Its always a good feeling to be remembered by someone. A little extra special when you don't even know that someone. :pI used to get the bus to work and there was this girl that used to get on the bus too and I'd always look out for her as I had a crush on her. \s\sThis went on for a few months always waiting for her to get on the bus. I was plucking up the courage to speak to her but I know in the morning on the way to work that people aren't in the best of moods.\s\sUnfortunately I then got made redundant from that job and so had  stopped taking that bus I was absolutely gutted.\s\sMany months later I was at a club and there she was the girl from the bus I had a few bottles of liquid courage by this time and so now I started talking to her. The best thing is she recognised me from the bus too and said she had a crush on me too. We hit off straight away we've now been together for 2 years. Why was the fact that he was indian important?Sorry I'm drunk but this is just so beautiful? I criedI had a ""highway walking"" buddy. I walked the highway in my little town to the library about four times a week throughout my childhood. He was always on the opposite side of the highway walking the opposite way of me.  We always nodded to eachother but other than our highway walks we had never seen eachother before. Odd considering my hometown has a population of 350-ish. Well one day I walked to the library about half an hour earlier than I usually do and found him sitting right next to the computer that I always use if available. I said whats up and started a conversation. Turns out he leaves the library as I'm on my way. Familiar strangers. When I was working the early early morning shift at Wal-Mart this guy would come in just getting off of work buy some liquor and go home. He'd always come into my check-out though and we'd talk. He called me Phoenix-Girl (we were both from Phoenix AZ) and in my head I called him Cheech (he looked and sounded a lot like a young Cheech Marin). Then one day he stopped coming in. I don't know what happened to him - maybe he lost his job or something. I just know that he was gone.There is even a popular book about such a thing... Girl on the Train or somethingI once commuted with a guy; never knew his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.There is an old guy who gets on my bus home from work each Tuesday and Thursday. I think he heads to the pool club because he always has a pool cue carrying case with him. We always smile and nod at each other and I dont know his name but he looks like a Colin.\s\sI havent seen Colin in three weeks and I genuinely miss him. Bumping into him on those days made me happy. Like a reminder Monday is gone and Friday is just around the corner each week.\s\sI hope Colin is ok.I lived next to this 80-year old for a year at my apartments and I would only see him occasionally due to my work schedule but I always made sure to say hello and wish him a great day. \s\sIt came time for me to leave the apartments and move out of state the day before I left he stopped me and wished me luck and basically reassure me that I would do great things in life.\s\sThe conversation kept going and it turns out he has no family or friends close by. I wanted to cry right then and there I regret not talking to him more. But I’m currently sending him a post card and wishing him well! \s\sCheck up on the elderly even if they’re just neighbors. It could make their day. When my family and I lived in Japan we stayed in a home in Ikego for a while.\sMy bus stop to take me to school on base was right next to a convenience store across the street from a line of homes facing it.\sEvery day at around 6-7 in the morning I would stand out there to wait and watch a businessman get into his car to go to work.\s\sAfter the first week or so he started bowing to me before he would get into his car and I politely bowed back. Sometimes we waved to one another but mostly we stuck to bowing.\s\sOne day months later it seems he was going to be gone a while I assume a business trip of some sort. His wife came out to see him off. After he closed his door and drove away his wife turned to me and gave me a deep formal bow.\s\sIt suddenly struck me then that he must have told her about me and the routine we shared. The fact that two (three technically) strangers could share such an emotional bond has never ceased to impact me.That is the best and somehow so Japanese. I love it. This is probably my favorite one in this thread. I have a couple relationships like that but it has never occurred to me to tell anyone about it. That's very heartwarming to hear thanks for sharingThere was a homeless guy in his 40s(?) with a big beard and in the same clothes etc who sat by where I get breakfast on the way to work. Every morning I would get him a coffee with milk and 3 sugars and a bacon roll. He would say ""thanks have a good day"" then I'd say ""no bother see you tomorrow"". I didn't know his name but he always seemed happy and grateful to just get breakfast. \s\sThis became a routine for almost a year then one day he wasn't there. Then the next and the next. I contacted the nearby shelters to see if they knew anything but I got nothing. I started feeling genuinely scared something had happened to him so I started asking any homeless people I met if they knew anything. But without a name I wasn't getting anywhere. \s\sA month or so went by and I had lost hope TBH but I still went for breakfast at the same place. Then one day when it came to paying a man stopped me and said it was on him. It took a while to register who it was but it was my nameless homeless friend he was in clean clothes and shaven looking better than ever. After having a chat it turns out he got a job after years of trying on the early shift at a local factory. He had just saved enough to put a deposit down on his first rented flat. He was there to repay me for getting him breakfast all those times. I have never felt happier for someone we still get breakfast time to time and he is doing well to this day :)This is a beautiful story. You both sound like great people :) This is so amazing and encouraging Thank you for sharing this. Thanks for sharing your breakfast. I live in FL & work at a restaurant.. we used to have this homeless man Gregory come in every day and order a soda and just sit at the bar and watch tv for hours to escape the heat. It’s so damn hot so we didn’t blame him and didn’t mind either. He always kept to himself. He had a couple bags that he would drop off at the host stand and we would make sure no one touched them. It became so routine we would just comp a dish and his soda for him every day. Then we were (indirectly) hit by a hurricane last season and everyone had to evacuate. No one saw him after that. We were all really worried and decided to raise money so that if he did come back he would have a little financial cushion. \s\sWell he never made his way back.. and I thought of him very often and worried about him. My late brother was homeless for a while at the peak of his mental illness and Gregory reminded me a lot of him. I was scared something happened to Greg as it’s a very hard life. \s\sUntil a few weeks ago. I’ve been going through a hard time and heartbreak so I’ve been seeing a therapist. Her office is on the opposite side of town an area I typically wouldn’t visit but it was the only practice I could get in. Well I was ubering the 40 minutes home and as I was sitting in the back seat starring out the window thinking about life we came to a stop at a light. Who do I see sitting at the bus stop? Gregory. \s\sI couldn’t help but smile really big. Maybe his circumstances haven’t dramatically changed it seemed like he’s still living on the streets... but he’s safe. Okay this one got me to cry. I’m so happy your friend got his break I always love story's about homeless people getting back up its amazingAwn I teared.Your story made me smile. Thank you. :-)Please tell me this is real :')Ducking onions You are great dude!""The 5:22"" by George Harrar is a great short story like this. LeVar Burton read it on his podcast.\shttps://pca.st/u95u\s\sEdit: LeVar not LavarThis is how I met my wife.Fun story I guess: I was commuting via CalTrain from San Jose to SF in the Spring of '08 and I noticed her on the platform at the same times. She always had a group of girls with her and I was alone. We saw each other often and would make eye contact but it was hard to get to talk; crowded trains and so forth.\s\sI ended up being able to sit with her group right across from her in fact one morning as the crowd was all rushing on the train. I was trying to think of the right thing to say and I got a text from a friend right then that Fidel Castro had given up power. I was genuinely shocked and I said out loud ""Wow it's the end of an era Fidel Castro just gave up power in Cuba."" She laughed and said ""Wow."" We laughed and didn't talk again for a few weeks. Finally one morning she had no friends around her and I struck up a conversation. Eventually I asked her to dinner we stretched dinner into seeing ""Be Kind Rewind"" and that was it. \s\sWe're together 10 years this past April and married 5 on Labor Day :)I'd love to hear more about this story!You guys need to grab lunch or a coffee. This could be a great friend for life! \s\sReminds me of the lady that ordered pizza everyday. One day she didn't order and the delivery folks got worried and called 911. Evidently they saved her life.I used to take the train to my very early job and sometimes I’d fall asleep on my way. I always sat in the same place and a woman who didn’t speak English always sat in the same place across from me. Without fail every day that I fell asleep she would wake me up at my stop. We never spoke otherwise but I always felt like she was my friend. How would she know it was your stop \s\sEdit: never mind I realized she just saw you get out at that stop when you weren’t sleepingActually this happened to me in highschool too I've fallen asleep in the bus and an old lady woke me up just at the station of a prestigious school saying it's your stop. \sIt made me feel really nice thinking she has that high expectations and waking me up. \sI rushed at the door and stopped as I realised it's not mine. It was the next one where there are bad schools. I felt so bad for ruining her expectations This inspired me to talk to my stranger today. This post had a strong impact on me.I have a bum foot.  I have compensated for it my whole life but now my back is falling apart because of it.\s\sAnyway I was on crutches for a couple months as a college freshman.  There was an older policeman with my university police force who drove a van getting several of us to classes in the morning. I was around a lot of older people as a kid and had been taught to respect them listen to their stories and be pleasant.  The other kids didn't really interact with him.\s\sOne day he looked at me kind of surprised and said ""I want your foot to get better so you don't need me any more but I'm gonna miss you!""  I told him I felt the same way.\s\sA couple weeks later and I didn't need him any more but I've never forgotten him.There was a girl I used to pass on my way to work every single morning in the same stretch of sidewalk. One morning I decided to say ""Hey good morning"". She looked at me kind of disgustingly and started walking on the other side of the road or at different times after that. Super lame! And no I'm not some sketchy looking creeper.Happy cake day!!!My mom used to go the same gas station every week to fill up. This is in Wisconsin and one morning it was snowing and she couldn’t find her ice scraper and the man from the gas station said “take one you come in everyday”.\s\sMy mom went back every week for another couple months before he just wasn’t there one morning. Turns out someone tried to rob the store the night before and shot him and he didn’t make it. It’s amazing the impact people have in our lives by simple gestures.Never knew each others names. Best friend I ever had. I still don't talk to him sometimes.I have the same morning routine as this one cute girl of going to the gym every morning and then eating breakfast at the same place. 5 more months and I might get the courage to speak to herI love this so much.This reminds me of a group I used to see on my way to drop my son off at daycare. Every morning I’d see two older woman walking arm in arm while two older men walked side by side behind them. They’d all be laughing and chatting and were out even on cold or rainy days. I always noticed how happy they looked.\s\sAnd then one day the two men and one women were walking three abreast down the sidewalk clinging desperately onto one another and sobbing as they walked slowly down the street.\s\sThe three of them continued their walking routine for as long as we lived there but I never saw them again without feeling a pang of sorrow.Jesus christ that's so subtly dark Reminds me of 5 people you meet in heaven by Mitch Albom.[deleted]I guess it's just the right amount of identification to share a story about?Because you get more fake internet points when you talk about an interaction with a minorityITT humanity relearning how to connect with each other. Check mate smartphones.There was this homeless man who I always passed by on my walk to work He always chilled at the same spot so l practically saw him every single day for a couple years. I never said a word to him sometimes I wouldn't even look in his direction. One day on my way to work i noticed there was a vigil where his belongings used to be and I dont know why but i was suddenly overwhelmed with sadness. I never saw him ever interact with anyone! he never asked for money i dont think i ever head him speak a word. but here was this vigil filled  with candles flowers letters and a couple  rosarys for him. He probably never spoke a word  to any of those people even so his death was still mourned and he will be missed by the strangers that never spoke a word to him simply because he was part of everyones (including myself) daily routine. R.I.P stranger hopfully you're in a better place. wherever that place may be. Something similar happened to me in college.  Jumped on this bus before class and saw this Hispanic mother with her daughter. I sat across and smiled at them but the daughter was shy and didn’t respond. That’s okay no worries.\s\sSo went to class had lunch on campus and maybe a meeting went back on the bus. And what are the chances but the same woman and daughter were there hours later - the little girl recognized me and had the most genuine smile as she realized the coincidence and tried to tell her mom. Our minds were both silently mind blown but in total silence. Always makes me smile when I think about it.No matter how alone you feel you've touched many people's hearts just by being. 99% of the time you'll never know how or how much or to whom but unspoken love and affection fills every inch of the space in-between us.Post is wholesome and all but can we take a look at that profile picture?Coool story and all but why do you have to state that he’s Indian? Why you got white in your name?A buddy and I were recently thanked by a convenient store worker on his last day he was moving from the area for being nice people. We frequent the store multiple times a day and never thought anything of it. It really astounded us that we were thanked for something we considered someone shouldn't be thanked for just being what we considered human. Crazy seeing how much without intention people can influence others by their simple actions.https://i.imgur.com/tkUDNSx.jpgRip xbox I love this kind of thing. It makes surroundings so comfy. What is that pfpI love this and the fact that everyone on this thread shares similar experiences 🤙🏼I used to have a bus ride like this. There was this nice dude and his daughter that would share most of the same route and time (he'd get off a few stops earlier and drop his daughter off at preschool then continue to roughly where I worked too). We'd make a bit of small talk from time-to-time.\s\sOne week I had to go in early and so we rode at different times. When I resumed my regular schedule he explained that's it's common in Chinese culture for children to refer to parents' friends as ""Uncle"" regardless biological relationships and when I was not on the bus after a few days she asked her Dad ""where's uncle?"".[deleted]I also have a commute buddy. Never spoken to him. I feel like I should but it's just one of those weird things I think would be awkward. The best part is the other day I ran into him in the middle of the day on a weekend! \s\sAnyways for those who know Vonnegut I consider these sorts of people part of my Karass.If you talk to him once you will have to talk to him forever. ""I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes."" -Ron SwansonRon Swanson must be a bit Finnish.I like that the picture of her has trumps face superimposed. Thickest trump I have seen yetIf I looked like that I'm sure people would miss me too. When someone says something like this I always wonder what the nationality of the person had to do with anything. I think it's just a way of giving him a little life while showing they know nothing about him because they haven't spoken. It doesn't matter if you then imagine him looking like Gandhi Geronimo or an old Indian friend of yours he has a face now and is a little more of a person to you. For some people he might speak in an accent although he didn't to me.Whether fact or fiction it is still a story. The better you know the characters the deeper connection you will feel to them.  Character driven stories would feel pretty empty if we didn't have a way to see them in our minds eye.  \s\sHonestly though I think you made this comment to try to imply it is somehow wrong or racist to include someones race in a story. As though the author of the story included ur to shock the reader.  as  though an Indian man would be friendly is strange?  \s\sMaybe you can explain it better to me since your the one who brought it up.  What exactly is negative about mentioning their nationality to build the character? It is an honest question because I don't currently understand it.I think it's best not to overthink this it's just short way of describing what the person looks like.When someone asks something like this I always wonder if they’re trying to start an argument and show others how superior they are. Please note MissMatieMae15's post history. This comment is in my opinion uncalled for. Especially by someone showing such low class. \sedit to add: How could mentioning someones nationality possibly be wrong? It's just a description of a person and if you think listing an objective characteristic is bad maybe you should look at yourself. It paints a portrait instead of imaging a fucking blob you imagine an Indian man. Like adjectives are a thing There is this one regular I see on my commute almost every day. Every time we see each other it’s always sneaky eye contact. Like looking at each other but not actually acknowledging each other.\s\sI feel like too awkward to say anything now so whenever it happens I start laughing to myself so I look like an even crazier person so yeah.I can be socially awkward/anxious but sometimes will just think fuck it what do I have to lose and interact with that person. And have always felt better for doing it no matter what the outcome.Next time you see them show them this tweet and say “After reading this I thought I should introduce myself.  My name is Roses and Tulips it’s nice to finally meet you.  I hope you have a nice day.”Just shoot a quick smile with a slight head nod. Basically the ""Hey"" that you give to some that you know and like but not well enough to stop and talk to. It sounds like you both are curious about each other but are too shy to make first contact. \s\sWorst that can happen is that their brain will go into socially awkward overdrive and they'll quickly look away. You tried no one died and you can still ignore each other from the corner of your eye if need be. Or maybe they'll smile back before you both go back to being too nervous to talk and that can be your new ritual. \s\sEither way it's a net positive. I know exactly how you feel I had the same thing with a girl who worked across from me every Tuesday. I had a hunch that the eye contact and sideways glances weren't just coincidence but told myself it was all in my head to make myself feel better for not having the guts to go and talk to her.\s\sOne week I made a snap decision to just go over and say hello it wasn't like me and I was way out of my comfort zone. As I was walking over I didn't even know what I was going to follow the hello up with.\s\sIt was a bit uncomfortable at first but it turned out she'd been hoping I'd go over and break the ice because she kept bottling out of doing the same.\s\sThis year we've been together 10 years and had two kids together. I sometimes wonder how different my life would be now if I hadn't made that snap decision. Looking back I know if I'd given it just an extra second of thought I wouldn't have gone over.I had a summer job and I would take the same bus after work to the train station. I always greeted the bus driver when I got on and thanked him when I left.\s\sOne day I missed the bus and took the next one. The next day he asked where I was yesterday. It turned out that that particular route was driven by two buses so from then on out if I missed my bus I'd intentionally skip the next one to catch him.\s\sMy summer job ended in August and he told me that he'd be assigned a new bus line in September. (I also learned that bus drivers have no say in this process!) This was about four years ago and I've since moved back to that city. Every time I see a bus I wonder if I'll see my friend again.There’s this license plate that says “I ❤️ Bacon” and I see it at least once a week on my way to/from work... it’s been a few weeks and I’m worried the driver has either A) moved; B) changed their plate; or C) met an ill fate. 😕 Hope the bacon lover of metro Detroit is doing well! 😄My office building has a restaurant on the ground floor and every morning I go in to get a small bite to eat...a banana diced fruit omelette etc.  I've worked in this building for 5 years now and while everyone is polite and friendly there's one woman in particular (usually working the cash register) that I talk to every single day.  \s\sShe's originally from Mexico but has lived here for around 10 years.  Over the past two years she's been teaching me new Spanish words and I return the favor by teaching her English. It started with me just asking how do you say bananas or strawberries but now we're way off  the menu.  We have such a warm bond despite the slight language barrier... I know all about her family and how her kids are doing in school her parents back home etc.  It makes my day every morning to talk to her and we both notice when the other isn't around.  It's now to the point where most of the staff talks to me like a real person instead of a transaction (there's several thousand people working in this building so most are just a blur in the crowd).  \s\sThere's another woman who is one of the lobby security staff who I talk to on a regular basis.  I'm in my 30s and she (~50?)  has two high-schoolers so she's been asking me for advice on how to deal with them when they break rules how to motivate them to get a job or good grades what colleges to look at etc.  Again I get a smile on my face every time I see her.\s\sOne more....I also met one of my best friends at the train stop... Same deal we saw each other every day going to and from work and eventually one of us introduced ourselves. We've actually discussed it and can't remember who talked to who first but we've been friends for 7 to 8 years now even with a 10 year age gap.\s\sIf you see the same person everyday talk to them.  Not just a bullshit hi actually engage.  Worst case the other is standoffish and you don't talk again and more than likely you'll make someone else feel happy.  You might even meet a life long friend.[deleted]I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never speak sometimes.i scrolled and scrolled until i lost patience and just control f-ed for the fucking ron swanson reference. [100% this is a ron best friendship](http://i.imgur.com/tkUDNSx.jpg) -- except it was ruined when the indian guy spoke but other than that total bff material. Why don't they carpoolI had this friend on a game called Wizard101 for like 6 years I never met him in real life but we would always arrange time to meet in the game and talk about life we met during a boss fight it came to the point where we became best friends we would legit buy in- game currency and stuff. One day I stopped seeing him and turns out he was a cancer patient. I still love you my Best Friend Nicolas Henry.This brought a smile to my face. We don’t realize what and who we have in our lives sometimes. For the last two years on my way to highschool this guy and me had opposite commutes we would pass by each other at certain point of our path.\sAt first this guy had REALLY long hair and had his head tilted to the left since the wind would constantly mess his hair up and he constantly tried to comb his hair.\s\sNow he has a scrunchie and some sort of pigtail but he looks much cooler and he has finally stopped constantly combing his hair.\s\sEven though we have never talked we smile at each other when we pass by :)[Best Friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes. ](https://i.imgur.com/tkzCzDk.jpg)There is this guy that makes sushi in a grocery store near me. I go there a lot because it's good. I don't know his name but just the other was the first time we actually said more than hi. Ask his name. It’s not weirdWhy does his ethnicity matter?\s\sEdit: go ahead and downvote me aurora it doesn’t make you less wrong. \s\sEdit 2: the more I think about this the more upset I get. This is the problem with our society you have to have or see a race to make a story relevant when race has no place or meaning in this story. You don’t understand the impact you have on someone else’s life until you aren’t there. Just because they never spoke a special connection can still form and I think that’s beautiful I moved to my first apartment about 3 years ago. Everyday before work I drive to the gas station across the street and this older gentleman would be there either gassing up his corvette or wiping it down. We’d never say hi how are you or anything for that matter. I noticed him every day and still do to this day. It’ll be pretty sad when we no longer “greet” each other in the mornings. I used to see a girl every day outside of a library for a few years never spoke to her then my family moved away. Few years later I get to high school and sit next to a girl start talking to her become best friends and she mentioned how close we could have been if we made friends those years back. I never made the connection until then and it was amazing. She said she missed me when I disappeared and I thought of her sometimes.When I was in high school working at a Piggly Wiggly an older couple opened a little bistro restaurant. I'd go over there on my breaks and they always treated me like a son. Then they were just closed up and gone one day. Met the man a few years later and his wife caught cancer and died then he moved. He told me that she always looked forward to when i come over for a burger and told her friends about me. Really good people i didnt even realize i had that kind of impact on themI once heard of the proximity effect which says that just by being in close proximity to people for extended periods of time you begin to develop emotional attachments to them... even bullies and their victims had some sort of emotional appreciation for each other over time... amazing what social creatures we areYou can't control who's part of your life but you can control who's life you're part of. I should start talking to my daily strangers. That's how I feel when I've been behind someone for hours on a long drive and then they exit. Feels bad man.You wanna know when your life is probably going in the wrong direction?  The person who would first notice that I’m not around anymore would be the Chinese lady who works at the liquor store.When I moved to a new school in fifth grade I took my bike to school a 5 km trip yet everyday I would meet these two older gentlemen. They would always be at the same place plus minus 50 meters taking their dogs out. Every morning for all those years. But then one year in 8th grade one of the guys was missing his dog. I immediately felt so sorry. Having thought about it all day I discussed it with my sister who was a year younger and she said she'd noticed the same thing. Empathy's a fucker.It's pretty neat actually. When i worked at a grocery store years ago (like 12) there was one lady and her husband that used to shop every few days. I began to recognize them (and them probably me) but the lady always looked grumpy.\s\s\sOne day i think i said hello and asked how they were since I had seen then fairly frequently at that point. Her demeanor changed instantly and she smiled at me and was quite personable even if it was a very short conversation.\s\s\sYears passed and i learned which family she was from [small town] and found it sad to learn that her husband died a few years back. But considering it has been over 12 years now i still remember her smile and realizing then that just because someone *looks* grumpy doesn't mean that they are at all. I still think about her even though she should have been ""just another costumer"" at work.Well said. \s\sSometimes two strangers have to eat the same shit-sandwich that live had served them. There's a powerful bond there.I started going to my local YMCA about a year and half or so ago to make a healthy life move. I attempted to go 5-7 days a week. About 6 months into this a retiree started coming in 5-7 days a week right at the same time as me. Back then I would  joke about “the fat old man” in the gym with me even though I wasn’t in the best of shape either. But we both kept at it and a year later I got in great shape and so did he. No longer “the old fat man” but “the old fit man.” I remember after Christmas past I was happy that he had dope new workout gear. The rare occasion I didn’t see him I worried about him. We never spoke a word to each other. Occasionally we would both check the TV for the hockey scores. Sometimes I wonder if he noticed me too. Many times the weight room would be empty near closing and it was just us working away. I moved away from my city a month ago. I hope he’s doing well. He gave me the inspiration to go in even when I didn’t want to because I know he’d be there. If you’re out there thanks Mr. Stealyourgrandma. I’m coming for your title in a couple decades. I have a habit of sitting in my car to unwind a bit after work so I don't drive home all stressed out.  Its beginning to become a daily thing to see this one guy come up and buy a cigarette from me. The first few times I tried to just give him one but he wouldn't hear of it so he paid me for it and went on his way. Its been going on every other day or sometimes every day for a few weeks. I haven't seen him since Tuesday when we finally asked one another what our names are. I'm starting to worry about my 'friend'.  I'm sure he's ok and its only been a few days but its weird how a stranger can appear in your life and become a sort of far away friend if you will. \s\sThere was also a man that I always saw walking on the side of the road. He'd be dressed well with a suit and jacket no matter the weather. He was just always around until one day he wasn't. I didn't see him for months and I figured that he either got a car or moved away. But a few weeks ago I saw him again and it made me very happy to know he's still around and doing alright. I think of him as my walking friend.  Love your perspective on life. I think it’s the “I’m not alone on this” aspect. You don’t know them but you know them... it’s a great feelingwhy's he gotta be Indian?Good lord I thought this was r/indianpeoplefacebook and already braced myself for something awkwardI wanted to see how you look like to better paint a picture of the scene. I regret zooming in on your profile picture. Can’t be unseen *.*I need an AskReddit thread on familiar strangersFriend got a mirror? Tmobile doesn’t let me see imgur links...I ship itI have a commute buddy. He’s a big gay man who I stand next to. We have never said a word to each other but we’ll always smile at each other when we see each other around the small city where we work and we time our getting up and going to the train in the mornings. \s\sIt’s a weirdly nice part of my day. He doesn’t work on Mondays though which makes me feel a bit lonely but he always comes back. wait how do you know he is gay if you havent spoken?in todays reactionary climate im surprised this didnt turn into a #metoo moment. ..and that is how I met your mother...Sometimes it means the world just to be acknowledged...and that is how I met your mother...My mother worked in a hospital and she would take night shifts constantly. And on the mornings when she was leaving work she would take the same bus with the same driver and almost always the same passengers (due to the time they were few like 10 or so).\s\sOne day she was so tired she fell asleep at the bus stop (it's common in my city for bus stops to have benches). She woke up with the bus driver calling her and asking in a jovial manner ""aren't you gonna go home today?"" Mind you that in our country buses don't have to stop in a bus stop if no one signs to the driver that they want to board *that* specific bus. So the driver went out of his way for that. Also we don't live in a ""safe"" country so my mother being asleep at the bus stop would in the early morning hours be an easy target for a robber or a rapist. \s\sTo this day she says this had an impact in her life.Awww I hope they became commute buddies and started chatting in the mornings.  I always need that time in the morning on the bus to wake up before work.I have a habit of saying pleasantries like “Morning ☺️” and “have a good one 👋☺️” to people I see regularly. \s\sSometimes my country makes me feel like I’m weird for doing that but then I look at the rest of the world and realize it’s actually just showing common courtesy.\s\s\sI live in the USApretty common in the south at least in my experienceIt’s actually weird for the rest of the world and more common in the USA for this to happen would be surprised at how people pick up on things was the same when i used to get public transport before i could drive and would expect to see certain people on given days after so many months of riding public transport i noticed patterns of people coming and going and i would know their stops and almost felt like having a small insight into their day to day lives wither it felt intruding or not. Made sense to me... might be a load of non-since to othersOn my commute there’s this really nice guy who works most of the late nights at the train station by my work. If I made the train in time because NYCs digital signage just isn’t updated at 4am he gives me a big thumbs up. I was struggling to swipe my card one time and he just let me go and gave me his same cheery smile and thumbs up. Some day I’ll learn what his name is.This is so sweet I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. \sBest friend I ever had. \sWe still never talk sometimes.''- Ron SwansonGrowing up in Bangalore India - my schoolbus each day for 9 years approached a speedbump on our way home and as it climbed the bump I would look out my same window seat each day and see this juice man fixing juices and lassis (indian snack drink). We gave each other a thumbs up at some point and it became our thing for almost a decade. When I gradauted school one day I went and said hello. We had nothing to talk about it. I think we both felt weird hahah I've progressed to acquaintances with 2 of my 'commute buddies'. One of them I've now known for 6 years and we started off just seeing each other at the bus stop every morning. We don't see each other much now but he confided in me when his mother and partner both died. \s\sReminds me of this really lovely Brain Pickings [post](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/10/12/big-wolf-little-wolf/).This is where we are now in this world. The most simple human personal interaction triggers a surge of emotion...wow what have these phones and technology has done to us.When I end up traveling along side the same car for hours and finally one of us in departing I always wave... it just seems to make sense to me. When I was working one of my first jobs in my early 20s I used to have this fairly long commute including a 40 minute train journey. \s\sThere was this cute girl probably around my age who I always ended up sitting across from every day. For me at least it wasn't even like I was deliberately sitting across from her; it was just that the train was still fairly empty where I got on so I had a choice and I liked to sit in one particular carriage and seat for reasons of convenience when getting off and legroom comfort. She was definitely cute and I would sneak looks at her though.\s\sOne day after several months (so we definitely both recognised each other even if we'd never spoken) I happened to be looking out the window and caught her eye when she looked up as I was turning back round. She gave me this really sweet friendly big familiar smile. I immediately panicked stared down at my book with a blank expression and was careful to never make eye contact again until I moved jobs and started getting a different train.\s\sI'm in my mid 30s now. I'm thoroughly well adjusted. I have a partner who I live with love more than anything and want to spend my life with. But I still sometimes think of that moment cringe and wonder what might have happened if I'd smiled back.\s\sEdit: oh one more thing. I remember her looking sad as I frantically broke eye contact to stare at my book. Hahahaha. Jesus fuck 18-25 year old me.[deleted]I keep hoping the other person in all of these stories is on reddit and sees themselves in one of these stories. For yours more than any other.Trains ruleI have a sweet story for you:\s\sMy cousin used to take the 615am train to the city every morning. If you’ve never ridden the early morning commute train then you should know it’s pretty taboo to talk. My cousin however being the awesome woman she is who makes friends everywhere got a decent sized group of people who were in the same car everyday talking to one another. This went on for years but then fizzled our like things do due to people moving retiring changing jobs whatever. However they all became such good friends that they all cane out for her wedding a few weeks ago! Indian man? Like Cochise? Or was he an American? I always go to this little coffee/doughnut shop right next to where I do laundry to get coffee and change. I was behind on laundry one week and when I finally got around to doing it this sweet old Chinese lady behind the counter who I had hardly spoken to asked me where I had been. Now we have full conversations every week and she gives me life adviceThis is touching when strangers ask about you where you've been what you've been up to when your life breaks up the shared routine. It's kinda weird but life advice from strangers just feels so nice to hear.. more so than friends / family sometimes. Guess it's the lack of familiarity that can lead to unbiased and earnest urge to help. I used to stop at a petrol station a few times a week on my way to work. I never really spoke to the lady that worked there beyond ""hi thanks bye"" I fell pregnant and she'd notice my belly grow over the months. We still didn't really speak but when I was nearly due I went in and she had bought me so many baby clothes as a gift. I was blown away! I go to a thai restaraunt in my neighborhood and I usually order a pad thai and some curry. After 5 times of ordering the same thing i picked something different and the lady at the till made a comment about it.Is that profile pic Trump's face on a lady with a hot body and long blonde hair? Or does she just have a very unfortunate face? Share food next chance. Bring something to reciprocate the love you felt.\s\sThe little moments matter most. That is beyond adorable! I hope they exchange names and stories after this.I'm still living for this kind of event to take place in my life so I can feel wholesome and hopeful againYou dont have to. Go on a trip in the public transit once or go and help homeless people. There are good people everywhere and you just have to look for themI met one of my best friends on the bus they'd get on like three stops after me and then the same exact commute to the college we were going to. After a week of watching him and me follow the same route i just sat down next to him on the bus one morning and introduced myself. That was over ten years ago now xDI had a similar situation that ended in sadness. I used to work for a tech company that meant I had to spend some weeks in Sydney Australia sometimes. Whilst sitting in traffic one morning heading to the office I saw a gorgeous Mini Cooper in the martini colours (martini racing more specifically) and I sat beside him for a bit so I made sure to comment how much I loved his car. Then I happened to sit beside him in traffic many more times after that. Lots of times it was because we shared the same schedule but then after months away I would return to Sydney and sure enough there he was. I liked the guy! I especially liked his car being a symbol of his creativity. \sThen I was watching news and they were reporting on a bad car crash that was caused between 2 Supercars racing. I saw the images and caught in the crossfire of the 2 racing cars was his poor little Mini Cooper in its martini colours. I never saw him after that....:( nooooooI work with pretty good honest and presumably decent people. I don't speak to anyone unless I'm spoken to first or if they are in my way and I have to wait until they are finished in able to proceed with my job. (SMAll talk)\sI'm a bipolar introvert. I greatly appreciate when people go out of their way to greet me sometimes. Thank you. I'm not really that weird and I'm not gonna terror attack or any crazy shit. I just been through A lot and I am socially awkward because of trust issues and shit. Thank those who aren't prejudiced and closed minded. Brown-man here can verify we get very attached to strangers we see every day. I used to drive past a lifted purple dodge every morning on my way to work. After a few weeks they started giving a little wave and everything. Then I got a new job :( I've been out riding my motorcycle alone wound up behind a couple on a bike and ended up taking the long way home passing my original turn-off in order to ride ""with"" them longer. When I finally turned off the woman on the back turned around to wave bye to me and it made me feel so happy. Kinda like when you're driving for a long period and you stay with someone for mile after mile and they turn off. \s\sThen you're faced with more miles alone and your buddy is gone.I love it when due to different rest stops etc. you end up catching up with each other later in the day. It's like seeing an old friend again.Yes! On longer interstate trips I’ve rolled down the window and waved goodbye to a few ‘buddies’ while exiting the highway. Usually for those that I could tell wanted a buddy too; traveling the same speed leaving room when both changing lanes and overall respect while driving together. \s\sI like to think the farewell meant something to them too :)I hate being the person that has to turn off. Sometimes when I'm on a common commute and if I found someone to follow I try not to take shortcuts and keep following them. I'll feel a bit lonelier when I'm riding my bike in the snow and the other bicycle's tracks turn off down another road.I left Jacksonville FL one day on I-10 and just fell in with a line of 8-10 cars doing a little over 90mph.  I figured there was safety in numbers and followed along....for over 200 miles.  We passed two state troopers that I saw who didn't move.  When I turned off in Marianna after a couple of hours the two cars in front of me and the one behind me all waved.  It was just one of those passing magical little moments that makes life entertaining.[deleted]Omg I’m not the only one! It’s this special bond when you always pass the same people together because you’re both going the same speed and have the same highway behaviors. I always imagine I’m in that final scene of F&F whatever it was where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker go their separate ways [deleted]This past New Years I drove up from Anaheim to the Bay Area and I followed this suv for about 200miles on I-5. We both had our cruise control set around 90mph and when she turned off I realized it was an older woman in her 70’s. I thought for sure it was a younger person like myself but nope! Grams had a lead foot and I enjoyed her draft for a solid 2-3hrs. Basically me when I was in socal for college but from the Bay Area; that highway 5..  \s\sWhen someone gets pulled over I say silent thank you to the guy getting pulled over for taking one for the team lol.Absolutely this! There’s a particular instance that stands out for me. \s\sI was driving home to Tennessee from school in Alabama for my first Thanksgiving away. Probably made it 30 miles out of town when I realized I had a new best friend. Middle aged guy in a white VW we were both maintaining solid speed weaving our way in and out of traffic. He’d pull ahead at some points and I’d follow then I’d take the lead for a little while with him drafting behind. Never a race just Magic Man and El Diablo headed North. \s\sWe must’ve driven together for 125 miles or so before a split came up and I saw the blinker of friendship flash before me.  I knew it’d come eventually but homeboy and I were tight! As the fork hits I speed up to throw him a wave. Just before we’re parallel I see him looking for me too. We exchanged smiles and he gave me the best Robert Redford nod I’d ever received. \s\sIt’s been nearly a decade since that Thanksgiving weekend but I still think about my VW friend on any long car ride. Some say I’m just chasing that high that I’ll never have it again. The probably right but fuck them. They don’t know Todd (I hope that’s your name) like I do. \s\sI’ll see you again my friend. One moment that stuck with me was during a 2 hour drive following/leading a stranger. 3/4 of the way there I pulled into one of those rest stops and a few seconds later she pulled up in the parking spot beside me. We both took a restroom break came out at the same time but I drove off a bit quicker without saying anything. I drove a little slower and she caught up and slowed down to stay together again.\s\sI gave a friendly honk before leaving on my exit but I probably should've said hi earlier during the stop.\sI drove behind a guy for an hour and a half at about 4am. They were clearly tired as fuck going over the line from time to time and I would Flash my beams on em to try and keep them alert. I felt like I was giving my dog away when they took their exit. ""When I see you again""I once drove from chicago to milwaukee (1.5-2hr drive) following one car and the car got off the exit right before mine. It was kind of mind boggling. I was was on a road trip with some friends and I noticed a guy after a while. He just cruised behind me for 100 miles passing traffic behind me when I would. Then I started to pull off and he followed. While I was filling up the tank he ran by and yelled “Wait for me bro! I just need to pee.” We sadly separated 150-200ish miles later in Virginia since he was heading to Charlotte and us to Knoxville. Such a beautiful friendship. Got a 1500 mile drive coming up for the 4th of July and I hope I get some new travel buddies! I haven’t road trip for awhile and forgot all about it. This thread has got me jazzed up. Maybe I should get a whiteboard or travel buddy messaging.Yes!!!! I thought it was just me! 😭😭😭😭\s\sWhen I got my first car and drove off to college (crying because it was my first big drive alone and I was gonna miss my mama lol) I learned the power in that simple thing. So after some time of driving the road over the years I’d hang back for other people if I felt like they were trying to pair up for some miles especially at night. \s\sHumans can be awesome. I did a 15 hour drive in one shot from fredericton NB to toronto a few times.   One of those times a dude drove all the way to Montreal in front of me.  When he merged to exit we both rolled down our windows and waved.  It was a real moment. \s\s\sThat's like 9 or 10 hours together btw.I work the afternoon shift 3-11pm and going to work I usually see some of the same faces but it’s a university bus so each day is different but it’s when I go home on the 11:20 pm bus that’s when I see all my people they all have their little groups they get on the bus with at the stops near there works and I usually have headphones on so there’s no talking between me and then but Each time one of them isn’t on the bus ride to go home I do always wonder where they are and then sometimes I get worried they found a new job and won’t see them again even though we’ve never spoken it’s just the looks and head nods and the fact we all are feeling the same way long day of work and all we want to do is get home and relax that I think makes us all feel one in the same. Marry himwtf I clicked out of Facebook after reading that post and it's the first thing on my reddit frontpageThis is adorable can't wait to see this one reposted about one million times.Wait has it been posted before?! :(That profile picture phewI had a friend like this in college. We suddenly realized our classes would change at the ebbs of the semester and actually exchanged names and numbers and were friends for another three years till we graduated. \s\sOddly he was an Indian dude too.At first I read it as “as an Indian man” and was really confused by the profile pictureThere's a guy I see in my town all the time have done for years. We never speak and I don't even know his name but we always seem to cross paths. I went for a weekend in Wales once and was sat in a chippy eating a pie and dammit he was about 4 tables away from me seemingly enjoying his lunch too!! CrazySimilar experience here. I seem to always bump into this guy on campus we even had couple classes together. I think we were group members for a short time as well. But we rarely talked to each other. A year after I graduated I went to an apple store to try some Apple Watch bands (thinking about purchasing one) and he was there buying an Apple Watch! So I am in a wheelchair and to get to college or most other place I would take handi transit which basically a branch of the public transit dedicated to people will physical/mental disabilities and old people that you can book instead of waiting at bus stops.\s Now usually I would have the same driver(s) for a few days/weeks then it would change but it would still be the same ""roster"" of drivers and usually I get on say good morning pay the fare and sit and wait in the bus until my stop however there was one time where I didn't have this on driver for about 2 weeks and I was actually kinda worried about him but he came back and when I got one the bus in the morning he said ""hey haven't seen you in a while"" and then we started talking more and it was nice.do yourself a favor and zoom into the total babe in the profile pictureThat's so sweet I love it when stuff like that happens.  I have been ""friends"" with a few homeless people in my lifetime and I have always worried about them and missed them when they up and took off hoping for the very best for them.  One man was always especially nice and I would sit and talk with him for a few minutes if I was early for work I knew him for about four years.  I really enjoyed getting to know him he was an interesting and intelligent person.  I think it's important to try to make connections with people especially those who are different from you in some way.  It's common in India for commuter to make groups of commuter friends. They hold seats play card games chit chat etc. He's surely not a stranger to commuter friends if he's a first generation IndianYup we dobut mostly within our own gender. Reminds me of the time I used to take a train to work. I used to talk to most of the ladies who regularly share my route but rarely to guys. There was this one guy who got down at my stop and we just used to give each other an awkward smile occasionally. One day I took my kid along for bring kids to work day and this guy comes up to me n says ""I didn't know you were married"". I reminded him that we've never spoken before and he was like "" yeah but I feel like an old friend forgot to call me for her wedding "". It was weird and funny. We then started talking a little more till I changed jobs.TIL. This is actually useful to share—thanks. Otherwise her saying the other commuter is Indian seems like a gratuitous (at best) detail.Those kinda relationships are the best lolHope for curries?In my freshman year of high school I had study hall and the only other freshman in there was a kid who I knew but never was really friends with and we didn’t talk the entire year but it was just like this. What happened to saying hi to people in real life? Most people aren't out to get you. Say hello make a friend. Found the non-New Yorker/northeasterner. \s\sThat's unheard of here.  Europeans will back me up on this too.[deleted]I’m with you!  But I live in the south (US)You hear of these stories and some actually have the courage to talk and they end up getting married and having great lives. That's how one of my best friends met their spouse and they have 2 kids now and live in a house in the suburbs. I met my SO at a bus stop. Now living in a house in the suburbs. I don’t commute with anybody remotely attractive That's the story of my previous boss too. She and this guy would always catch the same shuttle going to work but not talk with each other at all. Until one day for some reason the shuttle was shut down. She and this guy decided to share a cab together and now they're married with a kid in high school. This kind of stuff can get really crazy.  Stories like this where perfect strangers never speak but one passes away... the other just sits wondering what happened.For ten years I would wave at this old man that lived at the end of my street. Mostly when we were taking our trash out to the curb (which happened with an odd degree of synchronicity over the years) or when I saw him mowing the lawn and I was walking my dog. I could have drawn a picture of the guy I knew his face so well but I never stopped to chat with him or even learned his name.\s\sOne day I noticed his trash can was still at the curb two days after trash pickup. I went down took it up to the side of the garage and then knocked on the door to check in on him. An old woman answered and I asked if the man was OK because it was the first time I'd seen the can left out at the curb in all the years I'd lived down the street. It turns out he'd passed away the week before and to say the least her routine was a little bit off. \s\sThat was years ago and I still walk down the street every week to take the trash out and mow the lawn in his stead. Over cups of tea with his wife and dinners at our home I've learned his name was Gerald he was a Korean War veteran and he took a lot of pride in his lawn and his flower garden. \s\sAnyways I guess the point is... take time now and then to meet your perfect strangers. Cheerful :/i wrote a slam poem style piece about this happening for an english assignment last year after realising that i hadn’t seen one of my usual bus companions for a while. i ran into them at school a few weeks later and they had just moved house but it really made me think about the people you see but never meet. When I was in highschool my teacher would tell us this story about once a month or so and it goes something like this:\s\sHe used to be very very fat until the age of 40+- when he decided to make a change and start working out (worked amazingly by the way just five years later he would run all the way from his house to school and back three days a week and the rest of the week he would commute on a bicycle his house was 27 kilometers from school) any way after a few years of weightloss he started swimming in the mornings it was only him and people who were in their early seventies or older and there was one regular woman there no one liked she was really crabby and sny no one really went near her but he said ""I'm gonna make her my friend!"" So he sinoly started saying good morning to her every day he saw her and even though she always snubbed him he never stopped until he had a really bad day and forgot to approach her she noticed and approached him and asked him if everything is ok he opened up to her and then she opened up to him he never told us what she said to keep her privacy but they apparently became very close friends after that!\s\sJust goes to show no one is ever really lost and sometimes all it takes is a little warm human contact.Is no one going to talk about the twitter picture?This is such a tiny thing but it really hits me deep 😓 much love to ya brothaIs it just me or her profile picture is Trump photoshopped on a busty lady?it's trump on a kardashian. a tardashian if you will.[deleted][Foxy and Friends](https://i.imgur.com/50sh9I5.png)/r/ConfusedBoners Haha this is greatI love these stories! I run on a popular path in town and have regulars that always make the run perfect when I see them and a little sad when I don’t: electric skateboard guy cute old couple woman carrying aluminum bat Zumba break lady. \s\sPrevious posters are right - you notice more when they’re NOT there. And makes you hope maybe you’re a character in someone’s day too.This reminds me of my grandfather actually. He’s from cambodia so his English is terrible but he and his neighbor in America shared a very special friendship. A while back my grandfather took a trip to Cambodia and when he came back and I paid a visit his neighbor’s wife was telling me about how he missed him despite the language barrier and he was kinda down. It was really sweet to hear. And when he came back they got back to chilling on their front porch enjoying the weather like old people do. I feel the same way about my lunchtime gym bros that I see every day and occasionally nod to but they keep me motivated because I don't want to not show up. I know they'll be there getting in their mini workout without me.I have a very similar story that happened last night. I have a Korean-Canadian parking neighbour at my building and there is a bit of a language barrier so we never really said much to each other. Seems like a normal dude never any issues with him just never had a reason to talk to him. Last night I came home and someone was parked in my spot with their car on (probably waiting for someone) and my parking neighbour was out at their window telling them to move its not their spot. I pulled up as they were pulling away and after i thanked him he said that he thought i got a new car but when he saw it wasnt me he asked them to move. \s\sSuch a small gesture but it really meant a lot to me. Its kind of unexplainable but I love the unspoken connections formed with people. Same thing when youre driving on the highway with the same group of cars for a while\s\sEdit: fixed some grammar and changed Korean to Korean-Canadianyay to Korean man a class act Anybody save that post from a few months back where that Indian guy always put his jacket etc on the seat next to him in class and it was told from the p.o.v. of some other guy in the class?\s\s7:20 AM A train at 17tth there are people in that train that saw me going to high school for 4 years and I never talked to them. The I went away to college and after 4 more years I came back to NYC and I happened to take the same train to work...  A few people still took the same train. Well judging by the user's avatar of ""Trump head with red cap photoshopped into a busty blonde in a sports bra"" yeah I'm sure the other dude would definitely notice someone like that on the subway[deleted]I work from home.... i would like to believe some one has been lonely their entire life I find careful language choice to be the most important part of arguing as a couple. I read an interesting article about it year's ago specifically not cussing when talking with your significant other regardless of how mild or the context. \s\sIt sited some statistics I can't recall and made a compelling case for hostile words being more damaging than hostile attitudes. Something to the effect of your SO can understand you being mad but cannot understand perceived unneeded cruelty.\s\sThe point is I find word choice more important than anything else a focus on clarity and communication without attempting to put your SO in a position of actual opposition. I'm sure I'm not overly great at it but I enjoyed the write up and think about it often if my wife and I have any kind of meaningful disagreement.\s\sI wonder if he read something similar.Its fundamental to having a working relationshipThis was one of the first rules my bf and I put in place when we started dating. If we're angry or upset over something we have to talk about it not just yell or shut down or keep it from one another. Three years later and we've still never really had a full-blown proper argument. This shit works folks!Sounds like you lost the fightI am so jealous. My husband of too many years tells me I'm the root of all our problems. In spite of running both our businesses & making sure the bills are paid. I would love to have a partner against the world but it's not meant to be that way. I need to get out. If you feel that way you should. Everyone deserves to feel respected in their home. This is pretty much exactly how my wife and I have managed to stay together for almost 20 years. Judging from what she said her boyfriend teaches her I think her boyfriend is a lot older than her. How do you do this without making your partner feel like your talking down to them? Meanwhile while my girlfriend thinks that any debate or disagreement is an argument or a fight smh still love that weird girl thoMarry him.I tried this with one of my girlfriends and she just couldn’t manage it she couldn’t come round to do it. I used almost the exact same phrase as the one stated in the end. Goals :/ Awwwww cuteeeeeI’m terrible at this....wow I need to sort this out ASAP 🤦🏽‍♂️I’m a teacher and special education assistant in a school. I try to practice this every day with my students to create a more wholesome and kind environment. Nice to see I’m not the only one practicing this. Eleven years in and my husband and I have never fought. We discuss our problems. People never believe us or tell us it can't last or that we just haven't had any 'big enough' problems. We've had some pretty major shit happen. We just don't let it get between us.I tried that and the bitch cheated on me and left me lol got some tho :)Fucking daaaI try this tactic with my wife and it always backfires. Like she thinks I'm belittling her or treating her like a child.  I promise she's a lovely ladyIs he a yogi or something? Otherwise the teaching bit feels a bit creepy.So if he cheats it’s not his fault the problem is his dick.eh gangI need your BF to teach me and my hub. Keeper no doubtWhen my fiancé and I tell our families that we don’t fight they can’t believe us. It’s sad that so many relationships aren’t built around that stability.Most people that grew up with dysfunctional families are attracted to other people that grew up with a dysfunctional family. It's common ground. I grew up with an abusive mom and a non participating father. They hated each other and were awful to one another. Im married with a kid and constantly have to work on myself but sometimes it's still a challenge trying to not fall back into that same pattern of anger and frustration. It blows my mind that a lot of people have never had full melt down arguments in every relationship they've ever been in. It's because at least in American English fight and disagreements are often considered synonyms.\sNot fighting is reasonable. \sBut Anyone who says they never disagree is lying or suppressing feelings to avoid disagreements.Fights arguments disagreements heated disagreements..all different.\s\sThat said you are 20? Yeah I've never had anything other than maybe pushing a heated disagreement until much older in long term relationships.  \s\sI mean that's awesome and all but your post is pretty vague.  There is zero conflict in your relationship?[deleted]I’ve grown up in a dysfunctional family with parents who either never should have married or divorced shortly after marriage.\s\sMy parents constantly repeat that no relationship is going to be perfect. There will be fighting because of disagreements... it’s because of their marriage that I truly do not believe in “soul mates”. My grandparents posed no better idea of what a healthy happy relationship looks like. Where’s the “if you ain’t fighting it ain’t a relationship” people at? 😂😂😂😂😂What a good manHe teaches me...If you come from a background full of drama/conflict and your partner hasn't then you have lots of unlearning and learning to do whoever you are. Stigmatizing that (I'm assuming because gender roles?) isn't helpful. Dysfunction in your life is nothing to hold onto and if you can recognize that you don't have the skills you need good on you. Don't listen to haters.Yeah I got a weird vibe from this post. *yeezy taught me*Beseeches me? If the BF has to teach her that then the parents failed that or he wants the overly complicated onesWhat happens if her BF is the problemGood stuff🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼Trying to find a smooth way to show this to my SO...your bf should give me some tips my house is like a free for all when even a debate is brought up.Hear hear!Knowing this is one thing actually applying it is a whole other challenge. It can sometimes be so easy to lose focus on the actual problemMy ex got pissed at me once cause I was helping her dad fix his truck in a BRAND NEW Walmart T-shirt. He looked at her and said “Meja there’s more important things to argue about than a T-shirt”. She never got it. We were divorced 2 years later. See I never got that especially in politics. Why do we get so angry? we’re trying to solve a problem not beat each other. We just have different ideas of how let’s discuss not debate.Just a fancy way of saying he rolls me oneWhy is her boyfriend teaching her how to conduct herself like a mature young woman during verbal altercations or disagreements ? \s\sIsn’t this something that her parents should have taught her as she was growing up ?  If this female is only now learning how to behave like a young adult after being with her obviously mature and intelligent current boyfriend I shudder to think about how she behaved prior to meeting and dating her current boyfriend....... \s\sBig ups to her for being self aware enough to acknowledge that she needed to change and then actually making an effort to heed her boyfriends teachings and mimic his sophisticated behaviour. \s\sSome people stay acting a fool and never actually mature or develop the ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings without the unnecessary histrionics.  That statement applies to both the sexes men and women. My current boyfriend and I have never raised voices called names or even really been mean spirited when fighting. We do disagree and I’ve even been super mad at him before. We just take an hour or two to settle down and vent to friends then reassess the situation. 9 times out of 10 it was an honest miscommunication. It’s a lot of “it’s hard for me to want to reach out to you about x when you treat it casually because it’s not a casual issue for me” or “I know you don’t mean to but it hurts my feelings when you say/do x” and then “I’m sorry that wasn’t my intention but I can see how you interpreted it that way” This is beautiful and I wonder where he learned to do this. Parents maybe?Her bf sounds pretty manipulative - possibly a cult leaderI had a girl break up with me because I didnt want to fight with her. It was wierd. She wanted to fight about really dumb stuff really early on in the relationship and I just dont fight about trivial stuff. \s\s\sShe even told me fighting was a part of every good relationship. So guess what I did? I married another girl that doesn't fight either. Guess what we never fight. We talk through things and MAYBE have had 2 heated discussion before. Other than that we are cool as a cucumber.I always thought yelling during an argument was what everyone did (because of my parent’s type of communication) until I got into my relationship w/ my boyfriend and learned yelling is toxic and hurtful. I’m blessed he was patient and understanding and allowed me the time to learn how to develop healthy communication skills. Eh.Yeah I’m sure this would work for my girlfriend except somehow it would make her even more mad [deleted]I remember my ex telling me she looked through my phone behind my back because she thought I was cheating on her. After continuing the conversation for a few minutes she proceeded to get angry at me for not getting angry at her lack of trust. I've certainly made a number of people angry but I don't think I've ever gotten angry at another person in my life. Just don't got it in me I guess.this is what wisdom sounds likeDOUBT (X)Smells like bullshitI wish people treated politics like this. Is this girl dating a philosopher? Like what the fuckGagging also works.A wholesome meal the the wholesome veal?You wait till you have a real fight. Someone gonna die lol[Word cloud out of all the comments.](https://i.imgur.com/gLur7Js.png)\s\sFun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. EnjoyThe biggest word is S. I imagine as in /s.So is the most posted comment in this thread the letter S?Is there a subreddit for that sort of thing?\sThat was very calming to look at 😌I’m glad that Dons on there. Good guy. #SHOW SWAY!?!*Look babe. Im going to teach you how to stay calm.*I might as well just set the couch up as my permanent bedroom at that point.[deleted]“Listen toots I’m going to teach you how to keep your tits calm. Even when you’re PMSing and being even more irrational than normal.”\s\sIt works trust me. I said that to my gf and we never argue anymore. We don’t talk anymore either but that’s not important. Famous last wordsI'd be like... I'm going to teach you how to stay single.[deleted]He should start a podcast Her boyfriend smokes the devil's lettuceI read this before it was a woman who was told by her grandmother afterwards as an experience of more than 40 years of marriage.\s\sAlso i heard a small phrase that say:\s“Make it different or it repeats “If only..Y’all sound boring But how do you do it?Ahahhahahahaha. Yeah. I wish. Unless she fucked up. Something about the tone and wording here is giving me red flags. I don't know for sure that there is something off here but the word repetition and the ""teacher/student"" dynamic sets off some alarm bells for me.\s\sI've seen the beginning of abusive relationships and it usually starts with the victim changing everything about themselves. I hope that feeling is wrong here but I hope someone else who knows her and cares  has their eye on this woman. I tried this with my ex she liked to yell. A lot. I said let’s look at it like it’s not us fighting but us together against the problem. \s\sShe just said “that’s stupid”.\s\sOh Dutch women. 👍He probably smokes weed.Serenity now…..  Insanity later…. But what if one of you is the actual problem \sI bet one of those steps he taught was ""don't be a annoying bitch""Yes! My fiancé and i are the same way. You can work through a problem easier if you're not screaming at eachotherTeaching others to be considerate can be extremely draining and frustrating.BF covering for what your parents should have done from jump. Then your BF wouldn't have to feel like he working two jobs. \s\sBut hey - at least you're reasonable enough to learn and want a better relationship - so good for you - I hope y'all stay together as long as y'all can.  Why do you have to be taught these things as an adult? This sounds like a parent-child relationship lmaotHaT's TonE pOliCiNG.\s\s/sSounds like Thorfinn.or it's the problem versus our problemsWondering if I am the only one who did not find this so wholesome. it's a shame the BF has to do all the emotional labor to teach her that.\s\sETA: helping and coaching one another is wholesome and wonderful. It is her repetition of the phrase ""he teaches me"" that conveys the entire burden is on him.my thoughts too. its like i get it but on the other hand these are things a person shouldnt have to teach their partner. Is he... İS HE JESUS?""It's not us verses each other""I try to do this and my girlfriend ends up frustrated because she feels like fighting is the only way to let her emotions out and she gets mad at me for being so calm.I don't know you I don't know how you talk how you argue etc. etc. etc.  \s\sConsider that your idea of calm may seem condescending or robotic to her.  I fell into that trap a lot earlier in my life and still do from time to time.  Many men struggle to show vulnerability or sincerity myself included.  Because of that sometimes our idea of ""calm"" is cold and overly rational working to explain feelings rather than validate them.  \s\sGood luck to you friend.If your girlfriend is anything like me it’s probably the only way she knows how to “resolve” conflict because it was the way she was taught by parents/family growing up. I hate that about myself. My boyfriends parents have been together for a million years and they are so sweet to each other. I wish I had that growing up. She may need to let her emotions out in ways that don't hurt you and your relationship. \s\sThat's honestly the primary reason I don't fight or yell at my husband. Hurting him hurt me worse than whatever I was angry about. \s\sI usually play video games but any kind of creative and/or challenging hobby would help her alleviate those emotions without having to target them at anyone.\s\sSometimes I know I'm heated and will just ask for space for a while until we can talk rationally.\s\sI also was ""taught"" by him not how to communicate. My parents argued a lot and said that's what happens when you love someone. I never knew how harmful it really was and how beneficial communication is until he showed me. So I hope you can show her too. Chris traeger learned eventually with Ann sometimes it's not about fixing the problem it's about letting your feelings out about the problem. Realizing when it's one or the other is importantIf you’re angry and emoting getting *no* reaction from the person you’re disagreeing with is *infuriating*. It feels so dismissive. \s\sIt’s OK to be mad and argue. Fighting fair is more important than not fighting *at all*. Odds are if she's feeling frustrated and getting emotional she's not feeling listened to and your ""calmness"" is making her feel invalidated. \s\sIt's really easy to see our partners mistakes in argument style but much harder to see or admit to our own. Realistically our own responses are the only ones we have control over so they're the ones we should be focusing on. \s\sI tend to believe (although I'm sure it's not always true) that if one person decides to take responsibility for resolving the conflict things will turn out better.A thing I do when it's getting too far like that is leave the room text convo etc. Arguments that are too heated by either party aren't going to go anywhere so temporarily bailing and recomposing yourself and letting them recompose is importantDid you try telling her to calm down?if it really bugs you then maybe you and somebody else she knows and cares for should tell her that her method of emotional outlet is a little toxic and unhealthy..? wording it delicately doesn’t help sometimes so honesty might just be the best policy... and having a third party tell her something she needs to hear would make it feel less antagonistic towards her for herShe probably just needs to feel heard. I have had a similar problem with my partner and it feels like she's trying to fight and you are going ""I know I know"" but she just wants you to go ""yeah that sucks""\s\sI'm not in your situation but this the case for me.Was just about to comment something similar. Any time I try remaining calm & logical people take it as me dismissing their right to be upset I'm not I just don't see value in screaming at each other.That spells disaster down the road. Hopefully you have it more figured out than what you’re leading on in this comment. Relating 100% to this my man.Yep same its quite frustratinglol this is so trueI'm just curious trying to make a tiny little analysis off of your post.\s\sWhen you say that ""she feels fighting is the only way to let her emotions out"" is this something she's actually told you or is this your phrasing?This is how it was with my last boyfriend had to block him on all social media the other day because he felt the need to keep telling what a bitch I am:(( This is me and my best friend. I'm constantly debating cutting her off from my life and being done. Shes borderline emotionally manipulative but from her perspective when we get too close she pushes and I barely hold on. \s\sToday is a great example. I said ""hey goin to school early to work on my research"" and responded sparingly as I was busy doing important things. And she took this as ""fuck you I don't care how you feel."" So I get it like I wasnt really present for the conversation but I told her ahead or time I'd be busy and she knows I respond when able.\s\sSorry for venting I'm kind of fed up. I hope things are better with your girlfriend!This is exactly me too. Then she says I am making her feel like the bad guy when I was the one who created the problem in the first place. I do this to my husband and he gets all shameful and defensive. But then after sulking he realizes the problem is being dealt with we are not hurt and we're still going to have an amazing day. Partners!Sadly i know that exact thing myself. It was part of what ended our 8 year relationship. Currently trying to work out custody and parenting plan fir the 3 kids. Looking back she was a horrible person to meSame I dont know her or her family but It may have been how she was raised. Not that she was raised to fight or argue but that if she didnt react a certain way to a problem or situation then it meant that she wasn't taking it serious. \s\sFor example when certain things happen around me or in my family my mom might get worked up over it or be angry or something. If it's a serious matter I'd also take it serious like her but I'd be calmer about it and my mom would think I wasn't taking the matter seriously simply because of how I reacted and how I describe my feelings toward it. I just try to be a chill dude while my mother isn't. I've had to re-train my brain.As I have been on occasion one of those “girlfriends” I’m sorry. It’s not really rational but sometimes we want a passionate response to make us know you understand how important the subject is.  When you are calmly agreeing our stupid brain is saying “WHY IS HE SO CALM ABOUT THIS HE DOESNT UNDERSTAND!Same but with the wifey. That moment when you hold your emotions not to get angry at your gf and tell her your honest feelings but she gets angry anyways.I mean it can work some of the time but sometimes you have to work through whats actually upsetting you. This is a good philosophy to live by but imo impossible to abide by all the time...Scream into the air and rip off your shirt next time. Trust me[deleted]""You're just sugar coating things!"" Never got through to that one. Got cheated on too. Tried to blame me for it too. Thought I was past it but it's been hard lately. =(I've recently gone through the same situation six months ago. I know your pain brother of mine.I think this is a good mindset to have in a relationship. I tried it whenever an argument popped up with my ex and it worked pretty well. We broke up because i knew i sucked at everything including that relationship so i let her go to find someone better than i was. Were still on speaking grounds but we hardly talk. I honestly hope she finds someone.My boyfriend is this way we learned to “fight with love”. We may disagree strongly but there’s no reason to raise our voices or name call or down each other. And as a survivor of abuse I could never thank him enough for that. i kept waiting for this to be funny He shouldn't need to teach you how to communicate at a basic level you're an adult.I try doing this with family and friends just remember before saying anything bad\s\sDoes this need to be said\s\sDoes this need to be said at this moment\s\sDoes this need to be said at this moment from you I give that a monthHer parents didn't teach her that when she was a child?You shouldn’t need some man late in your life to tell you how to remain calmDude I can't be the only one who expected a turn in this postMANSPLAININGI never thought about looking at arguments like that but damn that seems like such a great mentality[deleted]Pickles will prevail![removed]I personally would love a cookie. Are you offering?This anger sounds like there's a story to uncover He needs a smarter gfLol riiiiight \s\sYou don't match tone you're provoking from family experience. \s\s For myself and fiance if she's yelling about something silly she probably has something worked up from a shitty day she walks into the bedroom for 5 minutes and the other 23:54 minutes are.\s\s\sBut c'mon.. y'all don't yell?\sI’m sure many of us yell but the point of this is that yelling in an argument is not as productive as rational discussion.Boyfriend is the easy stage. Throw in a few kids some pets a mortgage major life decisions to be made then we’ll talk. You’re not supposed to fight with a boyfriend that’s how they become husbands. You have a point there ma’am""It's not us versus each other. It's us versus the problem."" The implications of this logic seem far reaching and could potentially help the world It is the culture of blame and liability that have been building for ages.  We fear and avoid liability as a matter of daily habit and when something goes wrong we often seek out who to blame as a first course of action.  \s\sNeither attitude actually solves problems.  I consider assigning blame to be the opposite of taking responsibility.how do you need to be taught not to be an assholeThat's some shit you should have learned your damn self. Self awareness much?Fighting doesn’t always mean yelling and being rude though.Ha good student.I teach my SO how to fight but it’s because we enjoy martial arts together.""Us vs. the problem"" is a major point in *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss (a former lead hostage negotiator for the FBI). Negotiations on anything will go better when the sides involved feel like they're working towards the same thing.I doubt. So in other words he's doing all the work.okay its good they have a relationship where communication is present and all but sis...why should he have to TEACH you those things? You sound like youre describing a father more than a boyfriend or lover. A partner shouldnt have to teach their s.o that stuffUs vs the problem is the absolute #1 most important thing I have learned in the past few years about relationships. It's such a simple concept but it has stopped literally dozens of fights before they began.That’s a good way of looking at itSo my bf!I thought this was going to be a ""And then he tried to finger me"" post.

\sFarming Twitter likes and retweetsThey need to teach this in school...I need to learn this skillLook up non violent communication I’d also recommend DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). It’s all about learning what are specifically referred to as skills that help maintain emotional regulation. There are a ton of books and free online resources available and since it’s very guided it’s easy to DIY effectively. this isn't even a meme. The best advice I got for relationships assuming you're in a mature one is always assume the other person has the couple's best interest in mind. Miscommunication happens feelings happen but if you know at the very foundation you are on the same team you both want the best for each other it's constructive.Great advice!Her two black eyes say otherwise ...You’re goddamn rightI feel like this would make me madder because I need to release my feelings rather than bottle themSorry this is nice and all but it isn’t a meme? Why is it here?People upvote what they like not what’s sub-appropriate I need to know how to teach my boyfriend this. He gets so fired up so easily. We've broken up over it. I love him so much and I want him for the long haul but goddamn we gotta figure each other outIf a bridge breaks common sense says not to rebuild it exactly the same.Listen to my words do not waste this life you have fixing someone.  I know it hurts i know it is scary i swear to god someone else will have their own flaws.  But find some else you can fight with in a productive way.  Someone you can lean on. Someone that doesn’t require you be the calm one all the time. Someone that won’t blow up over things someone who will face life’s endless challenges with strength and self control.  Someone who won’t teach your children to blow up over everything someone whose behavior won’t upset or scare your children because they don’t understand why their parent is acting this way. Someone you aren’t trying to parent along with the kids.  \s\sTrust. Me.  Sweet loving internet person.  Everyone deserves a glimpse of their own future.  I adore him still but our kids don’t understand and we are broken after years of trying to mend this exact thing.  I can’t wish to go back but you can pick another path instead. Counseling helped me and my girl. We are both hot heads when an argument starts to brew so we try to revisit the argument whenever we're with the counselor. We've only been four times but it's really improved the way we deal with each other when we're upset.Look up Gottman institute and the phenomenon of ""flooding."" Might have some ideas for you. Often men tend to bottle up their emotions and then they all come out in an explosion during periods of stress or pressure. Try remain calm with him and encourage him to express how he feels when he feels it because as someone who personally has had anger issues this is how I’ve learnt to manage and control it. Just my 2 cents [deleted]You can’t change him I feel this so hard. He makes me better. That's why I married him and feel lucky every day. I can be a cannon ball but he has a direct line to my heart and his patience has helped me grow. Wouldn't trade him or my relationship for the world ;) Can't ever do this when I'm in the middle of itCurrently trying to help my fiancé with this as well. He has a very chaotic and reactionary way of handling our arguments even when it’s my fault. He has his moments still but he’s come a long way. Communication is SO important and we always talk things through. We’ve both made huge amounts of progress by talking. I’m glad this has helped you. It’s actually kind of sad that her family never taught her these skill set and that she had to learn this from a boyfriend.Well they certainly feel all high and mighty! being civilized and what notGood lessons!\sWonderfulI'll stay single until the grave rather than get into a relationship where we bark at each other all day long. I know that would piss me off and become unhealthy really quickly. That's why I don't even talk to most to girls. I don't agree with them. After listening to ppl for a week I can tell if I will be able to relate to them without straight up lying or pretending to be something I'm not. Now i really need a GF! :(Don’t worry bro you’ll get your loverLMAO yeah rightMust be niceI was an idiot and mentioned this during thanksgiving. Queue all the insecure parents: ya but try it with kids!!!I feel this ❤️Kudos for acting like a human?Fighting is natural and part of any relationship. It's going to happen it. trying to act like it won't and avoided with this mantra is just going to make things worse. Doesn't it matter if it's you against them you're still going to get in fights. You're human they're human. Humans fight. What matters is what you do afterwards and how you handle it.  \s\sAlso I think she's using a different definition of the word fight. For her it seems that fights mean heading and violence but that's not what all fights areWhere can I learn this power?Not from a jediHere’s one place you could start: https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/dbt-dialectical-behavior-therapyIs your boyfriend your sensei?Bullshit Same. I’m hard core ADHD & have a touch of bipolar... the rage is strong with me sometimes. When I hulk out during an argument he hugs me. He just stops and grabs me and holds me in a hug as tight as he can and won’t let go knowing I’m gonna struggle at first... but then every time after a minute or so... it works and we’re hugging for real and I’m not mad anymore.  And then comes the talk about better ways of dealing & going over stuff from my therapy.\s\sI really love him a lot.Still doesn’t talk about her problems...This closest thing me and my girlfriend have done to fighting is one of us accidently does something to hurt the other and they feel bad and appologize said othwr then feels bad about thr first feeling bad and apologizes for that. This continues for quite some tjme before we realize hkw stupid we're being and try to make sure it doesnt happen again. Man I love her.My girl yells at me if I want to see my friends.... “Just stay calm” lolEvery time I've ever told a woman to calm down it hasn't worked. /sYou don't tell people to calm down. You just lead by example.It's easy to be calm when you're not the one who's been continually violated mocked and emotionally manipulated.My wife of 10 years and I used to fight to the point we would almost break up.  Over and over again.  Until one of us would break down and we would remember we loved each other and we would hold each other and have sex and sleep.  Often at like 230am.\s\sOne day we decided we would never separate.  After that I changed.\s\sI stopped yelling.  I was still mad.  I put my back against the wall and told her to come.  I held her and said ""this is how we argue now""\s\sHer head on my chest her arms tucked in with her hands on my shoulders my hand holding her head.  Almost whispering.\s\sAnd now we dont argue.  She comes to me and folds in like this when she is upset.  She asks for it.  And sometimes so do I.\s\sShe uses more words than I do.  I listen.  And at the end of it there are no promises or lies.  I might say something like ""more time with my boys"".\s\sIts... become the foundation of our relationship.That sounds absolutely adorable. We always hold hands when arguing. It’s something our premarital counselor brought up and we’ve been using it ever since. \s\sMight be time to “up the ante” and go full cuddle. Damn that awesome buddy! That’s very beautiful.Pretty sure her BF is YodaSounds like he’s gaslighting you.i spent my whole childhood watching people fight with each other and nothing ever came of it. nothing got fixed and no one felt better. \s\sso now as an adult i try to have this sort of solution-focused mentality. sometimes you need to make space to deal with the emotions first and that’s okay! that actually helps with finding possible solutions because we can approach them with a clearer head. \s\sfighting can be a satisfying rush especially if you “win” but it’s a vice like any other. trying to fix interpersonal problems by fighting is like trying to fix financial problems by gambling. maybe you’ll luck out every now and then but most of the time you’re just gonna make things worse. it’s not worth it. If only if people of this world were wholly brought up like this!:)))I try to do this. When my bf gets mad at me I try to just stay calm and rationalize things and try to see where I went wrong and what I can do or say to help him see my intentions and apologize. I sometimes get butthurt over stupid shit and he's not good at handling it and immediately gets deffensive every time which in turn makes me more upset and that's how a lot of our arguments start off. We don't get aggressive or shout insults but we do get upset at each other and I always try to make sure to remember that neither of us is perfect. I can't treat him like he's supposed to do everything right because I fuck up too sometimes. Wait what... You mean you actually listen and don't jump to conclusions at every problem?I mean it’s wholesome but not a meme lmaoReally thought there was going to be a twist at the end. My wife taught me how to have real conversations about problems.  I loved my mother dearly but she yelled when she was mad. I hated it so I would just hide from her when she was mad.  I did that with my wife at first. She helped me address problems before they became bigger. We’ll have been married 10 years this summer. Yes! My favorite thing about my longest relationship (now ex) was that we never fought. We disagreed sure! But we would talk about it in a compassionate way explain our sides why we felt the way we did why it was important to us and find a compromise. It's not about who's right it's about what's right.This mind work in an ideal world. In real life usually people are the problems.Boring - arguing is part of a relationship - you can disagree and still love each other I love this.  My boyfriend and I have been together over a year and we've never had a fight.  We're both super dedicated to working through things and talking before things can become a problem. This is a good lesson for ill tempered people like me. I like this. Thanks for sharing. Sounds like the bf wins This sounds unhealthy. I thought it was a joke post. This doesn’t read well at all. Oh The little woman needs to be taught by her man. Pffft. Great man! Straight up! I’ve been learning in a conflict management class that sometimes it’s best to express emotions when you really need to get them out. They’re natural reactions so suppressing them all the time ends up doing more harm than good. Expressing emotions only becomes a problem when it’s unrestrained or to the point of causing violenceThis respectful woman respects a respectable man.Sept 27\sI wonder how this couple is doing today....How is this a meme?I’d share this with my girlfriend because it’s kind of true with us but she’d kind of be offended by it and we’d have an argument. So I won’t share it with her but some day she’ll stalk my Reddit and find this comment and we’ll have a giggle about it. She’ll hate me but there will be a giggle. My fiancé has taught me this. He is always so calm and level headed I’m uptight and get worked up too easily. I don’t know how he does it but he always brings me back down and knows how to get me to take a deep breath.  \s\sWe bicker like an old married couple but any big fight we have had has never lasted more than 10 heated minutes. We always realize “this is stupid” and usually we laugh about it then tackle whatever it is This post reminds me that I made the right choice to leave the guy I was seeing. He always resorted to screaming and name calling. Never again... Couldn't get my ex to understand this. Guess if one doesn't want to solve a problem together they are the problem who’s her bf? samurai jack?So when I found out the new season of samurai jack came out I instantly streamed it. I started watching it and it was what looked to be the final battle and he was fighting alongside all the people I assumed he became friends with through out the season. The entire time I assumed this was just foreshadowing and the episode would cut away at any moment to the actual beginning of the season. I kept watching and watching but the battle didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon so then I moved my cursor to see it was half way through the episode and that's when I realized I had accidentally clicked on the season finale. I basically fucking spoiled the whole final battle because I was too excited to watch the season and didn't read the episode number correctly when I clicked it. \s\sFuck me.I know you're joking but I had a coworker like this. Incredibly mature and level headed to just about everything. Just takes a logical person to have this kind of approach.A foooooolish samurai warrior wielding a fooooooolish samurai warrior.Ghost DogJesusJackie ChunDoes he say ""relax!"" And ""chill out man"" and ""calm down"" like I do?\s\sI hear that always worksWould love to see him encourage her to seek therapy(individually and as a couple) to teach her better communication and coping skills.... ......... But that might upset this power imbalance he has goingWhile we're recommending therapy to strangers you should get some yourself.When my husband and I start to argue I will try to remain calm and collected as possible. He tends to yell and curse etc. I used to be like that but after a few years and having kids I realised it was a horrible way to live as it only hurts everyone in the end. \sI changed. It helps me see through my hurt and anger and really narrow down the real issue. As a result I am also able to understand where and if I went wrong easier. \sI’m trying to get my husband to be the same way and while it is a long and tough road it is working. ^practicing **small** ^text **ignore me**This sentiment is fantastic..and applied to just about any  relationship in your life will yield positive interactions.I am not bad at this but damn yesterday my partner pulled the master stroke in this shit and it was impressive. .....I tried this with my last girlfriend and she broke up with me over paper towels -_-Validate first then talk it out rationally. Regardless of how reasonable the feelings are they ARE feeling them and in that moment who's fault it is likely doesn't matter. Validate the person's feelings either side hear them out then discuss. When someone is hurt or sad or frustrated their feelings are very real and even if it's hormones all they often need is someone to say that what they are feeling it's valid and to get some comfort. Once they've calmed down I'm sure it's more likely you'll get a rational conversation. The only thing you get invalidating another person is a fight. Hella tackyThat is some amazing advice that pretty much everyone could try to followHappy cake day m8Good on you both! It took me a long time (and a very patient family) to learn that. ✌🏻👍🏻Dude is just smart. How do you keep your girl from going crazy flipping out and whatnot? Teach her not to...He teach you how to fuck ?You have a problem if you can't stay calm.This.Immature ass getting I to a relationship before knowing how to treat another person.Love this! Need to learn it thoughSomeone help. \sI try to be less like this and more into just being chill. I’ve been fucking up lately and I just want to not argue or get mad over dumb things. I’m a stupid dude sometimes. What are some tips from you guys :/I like that a lotSometimes fighting is important to get out feelings although everyone is different staying calm in every situation and for every couple isn't always the answer. \sThe key is communication. Getting out your feelings and listening to the other person. Not making any demands but allowing the other person the chance to see your point of view. As they say in Quidditch: He’s a Keeper!This entire subreddit is just people posting fucking tweets\sSeriously I was just about to say. The meme in /r/wholesomememes is meaningless.My bf does this too. We dont always succeed but he's always advocating this for me and himself. Hes very patient with me.Shes dating yeezyThis is niceI wishI wish I could learn this. Always treasure that very few people are lucky enough to find someone like that You can use this everywhere and if people do not agree to it then they're not solution focused but are egoistic and just want to belittle you that's why I hate politics it's a facade to cover belittling people.Can ur bf teach my mom....We believe youI need to learn this!Let's face it some of us have to get angry at the  problem first. It motivates us to solve it. I'm not a raging asshole it's just my process. -_-This!!  ❤turns out she doesn't have a BF  \s\s\s  \s\*dun dun dunnnn\*Fact. Weird dominant flex but okayWhy is this so real in a relation ship??Serious question though. What if a woman refuses to tell you what the problem is since ""you should know.""\s\sWhenever I'm in a situation like that it seems i can do no right.I tried to do this with my BF because I felt our fights were always toxic. I stopped gaslighting changing the topic to suit me pulling in other problems; I focus to only set this one thing straight one at a time so it doesn't evolve to a mud throwing conquest.\s\sHe is not really capable of that. It's probably my fault. He is too used to quilting and mainly gaslighting. I get panic attacks when people are gaslighting me because of my nMom and abusive ex so this is his way of winning a fight. I have to give up when I feel manipulated like so.\s\sI don't know what to do. Our fights became unbearable since I started doing this. It does feel bad when you are always calm and the other is always mad.I didn't realise that this viewpoint on problems was so rare. Fighting each other never solves the problem only creates more. Just get over the initial angry and rage and just start looking for a way to fix the problem. This is honestly everything I needed to read. I have a problem with getting mad at the person when what I’m really mad at is the problem. My partner helps me with this too. I’m not amazing but am getting better and I credit him with that. Must be nice to just be in a relationship. I don't even know what that's like.I want to learn this I try to do this I want it to be us against all not against each other but I have such a hard time with itIt helps me when I think of it this way.\s\sMy husband is broken. Some of his pieces are sharp and some are jagged. I’m broken too. I have just as many sharp rugged pieces. But we both want to fit together. And the only way to do that is to look very carefully at all the edges and figure out how to fit them together. \s\sChanging who you ARE is difficult and takes time.  When you recognize that the behavior your partner is doing that angers you has more to do with who they are than how they feel about you it’s easier to be patient while they try to change.\s\sThis of course only works if you both feel this way.I have major deppression and am a survivor of years of emotional manipulation and abuse. I get really really intense sensations of emotion that cause outburts and irrational thought. My boyfriend has been working with me on it for years. Grounding patience and brutal honesty has lead to many fights but a lot of growth. I honestly couldn't imgaine a greater partner. I wish I had friends/lovers who were like this rather than trying to antagonize me. I always have equated fighting to be the end of the relationship due to seeing my parents fight before their divorce though I know that it shouldn’t be. I thought this was r/memes and that the punch line was going to be ""overall he was a great communications teacher"".Unless the problem is he's fucking a bunch of girls behind her back. Real quick - can your boyfriend teach me some of that??This is very wholesome. Imagine the whole world took on this view...Take a shot of water every time she says “he teaches me.”[deleted]I’m sorry :(Have a cuppa I'll boil the waterBeen married forever and I would suggest the best motto you can have is “same team!”.That’s great!  You’ll fight eventually though.  It’s ok.Depends what you mean by ""Fight."" Talking out a disagreement? Sure. Yelling and throwing things? No there is never an excuse for that behavior. You can fight without ever resorting to raising your voice though. I think that is their point.\s\sThere is never a legitimate reason to raise your voice in an argument it just makes people look childish. My wife and I have been married 8 years and together 11. We've never fought. The insinuation that fighting is inevitable is just false. Some people are just in tune with each other. LmaoMy boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years and we have never fought. We have always always tackled it as us vs the problem instead of me vs you. There’s never a reason for attacking each other w/ words & saying things in anger or making insults that are irrelevant to the conversation [deleted]Why is this something that he needs to teach you and you can't learn for yourself?!That's incredibly lovely I am always trying to improve upon that myself. She sounds like she’s in a cultNah you sound like you have no idea what a healthy relationship looks like.But what if my gf is the problemI love that she has learned that the woman’s place in some relationships is to be subservient and obedient. It can really help avoid conflict. So happy for her 🤗 Now that is wholesome When I try that: ""Oh you know all the answers huh?""My husband taught me the same thing.Now I want him to be my bf.My boyfriend has been amazing about this as well. My parents never taught me how to resolve conflicts in a healthy way. There was always a lot of screaming so ever since then I'm afraid that if I fight with someone it will end in a screaming match. My boyfriend has really been good about working through whatever issues i have if at all possible. The most important part of a relationship is respect and that includes communicating and working things out in a healthy way. That's how they last. Goals That’s what I’ve always thought relationships should be. Not avoiding conflict or completely lacking conflict but to be faced with conflict and be able to keep it together through conflict or even better to face the problem together. That’s an ideology I feel like a lot more people could find useful.[removed]Being in a relationship should be a learning process no matter who you're in a relationship with. As a man in a relationship with a woman she has taught me more about myself than I could've imagined and I've done the same for her. It's not a better/less than thing. It's a partnership thing.Do you bring sexist baggage into all your relationships?If you haven't learned anything from your partner man or woman then you haven't been paying attention. EVERYONE can teach you SOMETHING. That doesn't make them better than you. Your view is just toxic if you were serious.So... If your college professor is a man you should just ignore him?\s\sDang.\s\sSeriously though if X person in your life is showing you genuinely how to be a better person to everyone else in your life who cares what gender they are??? If you had a crap childhood bad relationship in the past etc. you'll find it *really hard* to fix those maladjustments by yourself. Yeah it's possible but hard. That's what friends/etc. are for.\s\sMen and women should be partners and equals and for pete's sake women can learn from men and men can learn from women *and still be equals.* Learning does not make you inferior. Willfully not fixing what's wrong with you refusing change refusing education can make you inferior.\s\sNow...if there's nothing actually wrong and he's trying to change her mould her in some weird way that's wrong. But it doesn't sound like it. At most it sounds like she's a poor communicator (as evidenced by maybe odd wording.)""You did WHAT with WHO???!!!""\s\s""Baby baby yelling is not going to help solve anything.  We need to stay calm and work on the Problem.""\s\s""Yeah?  what is the problem then?""\s\s""You telling all the time.""\s\s""mmm hmmm.""What's this from? Also is it supposed to say yelling instead of telling?He sounds like your dad not your bfThe bf sounds like Dr. PhilNow look. This is gonna take a lifestyle change.Go to the ranch!I love thisYes. But what if the problem is the SO 🤔Wtf is he? ur parent?My ex and I found ourselves having most arguments at the end of the day. We’d be angry over the most minor things and someone often got hurt and it would linger. \s\sFinally one time I said to hold that thought I have to eat something I’m sooo hungry and feel weak. Turns out so was he. \sWe were both so freakin hangry and tired from our day because we were hustling it in new careers. Our basic needs hadn’t been met and we had no more patience to give even each other. \sThat became the new house rule and saved us so many fights. Anytime one started in on a petty argument the other had permission to ask “do you need a snack or some water?”  Even asking if the other needed a nap? \sNever have looked at a bag of string cheese the same...\sLife saver❤️Lol if I’m mad and my bf tries to teach me to be calm I’ll get madder Great post I never thought of it this way.

\sPost break up and I think this is good for me“Shipping beats perfection.” — Khan Academy’s Development Mantra. Nothing will ever be perfect no matter how much you try. Fear of failure (or even fear of success) often prevents you from taking action and putting your creation out there in the world. But a lot of opportunities will be lost if you wait for things to be right. So “ship” and then improve (that 1%).\sGoddamn. I'll actually be thinking about this all day. I'm so glad I saw it. Thank you OP.Wow. This gave me a whole new perspective. When I have my bouts of depression I often feel guilty because I feel as though I’m incapable of doing anything. But at least trying to do something or halfway doing it is better than doing nothing at all. Thank you! I feel enlightened by this. I needed to read this.Holy shit I think I'm depressedIt gets better :) It also gets worse but it always AWAYS gets better. Hang in there! As someone with virtually no self-discipline this advice is gold. I always strive to do 1 or 2 important tasks daily. That's it. I also try and supplement this routine with 5 mins of meditation and a ten minute workout. Although seemingly insignificant these little actions have made a massive impact on my life. Im confused why the gifted thing is relevantReally really needed to hear this. Because I constantly beat myself up for every little thing I don't do.This is how I live and it’s been nothing but a hindrance.  If anything is worth half assing it’s worth full assing Resonates for surebut not building nuclear power stations that must be done well. Yeah this is one of the few major exceptions. Damn that hit me right in my depression.Same. I’m sitting here crying. I’ve always hated myself for how little I can make myself do. I realize my brain is more toxic than Chernobyl and I’m not sure how to make that stop being a thing.\s\sBut here goes: I took a shower put on clean clothes made my bed and folded some linens today. I hung up some shirts I’d left in a heap on my dresser for a week. I didn’t fold my laundry but I finally took it out of the dryer. I loaded the dishwasher and cleaned up the kitchen. I accomplished a lot today and I feel good about myself for that.\s\sEdit: I’m crying all over again. Thanks so much for the encouragement friends. Your kind words of validation mean more than I can express <3Same. Wishing I never read it  lolSame. And my anxiety. The perfect storm. Same here. I needed to hear this.Same. I came to this realisation a little while back and this really shot me in the gut It's honestly making me feel worse about it... Like I know I should be able to at least do many of these things partially but I don't.And it's really good advice because at some point a switch comes on in your head that goes ""well 5 mins of running hasn't been so bad. Might as well keep it going"" The perfect is the enemy of the good. The good is the enemy of the done.\s\sDoing something anything is a win.oofJordan Peterson said that when a task seems impossible just do a little bit of it. If you do 1% of a task then that's 1% done. The next day you might do another 1% of even more. And eventually you'll complete that task bit by bit. Also I know this is a big thing for me. Starting to do something is sometimes the hardest part. So if you start something with the intention to just do a small part of it you can then just continue the action and complete more then you thought you could.That's great but Peterson's ""philosophy"" on things like gender and his poor understanding of postmodernism are not at all wholesome and I would suggest people steer clear of his foolishness.I'm downloading this and making it my phone background.You have no idea how much I needed this right now... my life sucks but this gives me a little hopeI didn't come to wholesomememes to be attacked like this.I needed this. Thank you. wow... I needed to read this I just didn't know itWhere can I find more help for this issue?\s\sI too am a former Gifted Kid (TM) who flamed out hard yet can't seem to get help from anyone in my life. They all still say ""you're so smart you'll figure it out / you'll have no problem finding a job / just do a bit of research and you'll figure it out in no time"". \s\sI've been failing at life for 10 years clearly I'm not as smart as everyone thinks!!!Go half away and then 1. It will be closer to the end now and longer to turn around and go back.I really needed this. It's been a rough few weeks for me and I haven't felt even remotely at 50% of my usual self. Just reading this makes me feel a lot better about just doing and not worrying about how great it is. Thank you.100% relatable depression is a bitchDid a reddit post just cure my depression? r/thanksimcuredI had a realization like this last month. I’ve been turning it around a ton!You can be a perfectionist even if you're not gifted.I'm questioning the math. If doing things halfway means 100% better then he was doing things quarter of the way before? He should've disclosed that upfront so that we don't have to do the math.No more zero days.\s\sThe top comment on the thread linked below is life-changing; definitely worth the 95 gold it has!\s\shttps://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/“Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.”Reddit seems to be sending me a message. I'm going to 10% lay on my couch and eat 100% of my frozen pizza dinner by myself. Think I got this everybody i really needed to read this\s\sthanks opI needed this. I am also without job on sick leave for a year now and recently divorced. Unless of course you're at work then you need to be perfect constantly.I’ve been in a real bad place coming back to college after taking a semester off because I didn’t feel capable of making the grades I wanted due to my mental state of health. I struggle a lot with writing so I’ve been avoiding the class and the assignments because I don’t think they’ll be perfect and end up sleeping all day because I can’t sleep at night because all my thoughts about what I should’ve already done but today I finally talked to my professor asking him to help me understand the prompts better. It was a start and this post makes me feel so much better about myself. I feel alone and lazy like I’m a failure but I’m learning to accept that I can’t be good at everything but I should still try. Hope this might help someone going through something similar and hope it helps me. An idle vehicle is getting 0 mpg. Anything over 0 is a 100% improvement.And gues what. Every time you brush your teeth for thrity seconds it gets easier to add another ten to it. Every time you do that bit of yoga it gets more intense until its cardio. Every bit of homework done builds study habits until you care about your classes. And eventually bit by tiny tiny bit things get better without you even noticing.My dad recently passed I’m just hoping to get to the poorly stage right now. I felt my soul take a sigh of relief after reading thisThis became real apparent to me as a new mom.  I had been a professional a wage earner now...I was at home with a new baby who I adored but fuck me if I didn't hate being a housewife!  I found this flylady website it's all about house cleaning and her primary premise is:  even housework done poorly blesses your family. OMG. This was huge for me. I totally had gifted kid paralyzation I was stymied. Permission to do it half assed liberated me. That and always going bed with a clean empty sink. They were game changers for me post-partum.I think this might be more motivating than anything I've ever seen on getmotivated.I remember seeing a similar post with about the same logic. If you're too tired to even make a sandwich then eat the stuff that makes up a sandwich. Grab some bread and eat that. Then grab some ham and eat that. You don't have to make the thing if you ain't feeling it (unless you're dealing with raw food). Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the goodThis sounds like a great excuse for lazy people...I am daily overwhelmed by things to do and end up slacking and procrastinating rather than working. I really need to work on this. I’m reading this after doing my yoga workout for the first time since Oct last year. I thought to myself.. just do it once and see about tomorrow when it gets here.I tried that and then my mom asked be why I got a 65% on my essay 🤷‍♂️THIS. THIS. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.This is so true. I needed this without even realizing. Thanks for posting!Struggling with depression house motto is **""Something is better than nothing.""**\s\sA very condensed version of every other way you can phrase that.\s\s- ""Better to try and fail than not have tried at all.""\s\s- ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.""\s\s- ""You never truly fail until you stop trying.""\s\sI'm sure there's a ton more to add to the list. ImportantHonestly forget to eat some days so I guess this literally applies to me. As a recovering Perfectionist myself I’ve found “Progress over Perfection” to be a hugely useful reminder. Great post we’ve got this everyone! Growing up my dad would always say ""it's not worth doing if you don't do it well"" and anything worth doing is worth doing well"" and that has definitely stuck with me in some unhealthy ways. This post is just so much better.Doing slightly more than zero is still slightly more than zero.  Do more. If you can. I felt this more than I expected. ❤️ to everyone out there feeling thisI needed this todayCool. But I'm going to try my hardest to forget this next time I'm feeling too lazy to work out. 9 times out of 10 I eventually get off my ass and do the whole thing.Wow! That was sure a lot of poorlys!!as a current depressed gifted kid I feel like i really needed this. thank you so much. i really needed to see this. thank you so much. Yes!Thanks for this I really needed to hear this Don’t let perfect get in the way of good. Don’t let good get in the way of average. This was me growing up.  I was really good at some things and liked doing those things and avoided doing things I wasn't good at-- I would tell myself I didn't like those things.  This led me to be imbalanced and unhappy.  It took me awhile to realize that it was worth working at things I was bad at and that is was ok not to be good at something right away.  My life has gotten a lot better since then where as before I was depressed now I'd same I'm generally a happy person.*Don’t let perfect get in the way of good.* \- motivational picture on the wall of an operating roomDon't let good get in the way of survival.I've also learned that when people want you to do ""your very best"" you might be the kind of person who should only do 80% or risk burning yourself out.This post is exactly what I needed today Don't let good be the enemy of great\sPerfection is the enemy of good enough.I've had ""If it's worth doing it's worth doing half assed"" as a motto for decades.\s\sA variation is ""Better half assed than half done"" if that trips your OCD less.My debate with my wife about laundry was that the laundry being done wrong is infinitely better than not being done perfectly.\s\sShe had a hard time with that and got upset at me several times but for a while I was the only person doing all the laundry for a house of five. She eventually caught on.Exactly better to at least guess those last multiple choice questions than leave them blank there’s at least a 20% chance you’ll guess each of em right.My variation is “Anything is better than nothing.” Usually when I start doing a small task it snowballs into other things but if it doesn’t at least I did anything over doing nothing.This motivated me to get off my ass and make art. Thank you. Stuff like this is why Im subbed to you guys. Thanks for the wholesome post OP!As a depressed former Gifted Kid current Honors College Kid I felt thisMy new mantra is ""just one thing"". Putting  away one piece of clothing take out one piece of trash prep one piece of food for later. Something is better then nothing Just blew my motherfucking mind just nowI had straight A's in college for 2 years then dropped out because a bad breakup drama with my girlfriend caused me to miss studying for a test. I didn't even know there was a test that day. \s\sJust left before the test even started and never went back. \s\sTaking an 80 and still getting an A in the class probably would've been preferable to dropping out in retrospect. The Gifted Kid mentality is just enforcing the idea that you can blame your faults on external things.\s\sProblem is everyone has external issues. Life and success is about overcoming those issues rather than using them as ways to define yourself. \s\sThere's nothing wholesome about resenting your folks for raising you with due praise to the point that you hold them responsible for your inability to take the reins in your own life. One day you saw yourself slip and had your straight A's taken away and either learned you were mortal or did nothing about it. \s\sThat's on you not your loving parents and it's unwholesome to blame those who love you like thatLove the teacher’s quote. I believe it’s from Chesterton a writer I admire a lot — even though I get how his work could offend nowadays! https://www.chesterton.org/a-thing-worth-doing/I just spent 15 minutes cry-laughing because of this. I'm not sure why but I think it's because I'm trash and didn't realize why I'm trash. So thanks dude. I think I needed this. in my high school they dump all their funding into the ""gifted"" kid classes. Makes me upset because we were still using books from 2012 (yikes)My high school didn't have gifted classes.Wow. Just today I had a come to meeting with myself about doing an ""at least bare minimum"" daily fitness improvement. This is exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you. Thats why when I do get myself to do exercise I always think half-assing something is better than not doing it all. Once I start doing it I usually forget about the preliminary uncertainty.K Imma go wipe out 50% of all life in the galaxy. This is the second time I’m seeing this post today on 2 different platforms.....I definitely needed to hear thisLegit ness This right here is what I'm talking about ♡ thank you for this post.This helped me take a shower and brush my teeth. Wow lol. Why am I so damn depressed?Malfunctioning GiftedKid™ here this is really what I needed.Wish I could paste this in my brain. Wow. Thank you.That's the dumbest shit I've ever read.Thank you so much for sharing this OP. It’s been a bad week and i’ve been so numb and floating and this is what I needed thanks.To this day I swear on all the holy books 'Gifted' class was a scam.That was fucking beautiful Thank you. I needed this and am learning this lesson now. I was depressed lost my job moved from texas to soCal and really have just been putting in most of my effort into my new job but letting everything else fall to the wayside. showering gym my health were all just 3rd fiddle basically. Then I saw myself in a mirror legit got grossed out and just have been putting myself through the ringer trying to run from that image. Put in a least a little because it's better than nothing.My husband once said to me “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good”. Blew my mind. Everything suddenly seemed doable after he said that to me. Yep.\s\sIf your goal is $1 million and you only hit $900K - is that failure?\s\sWhat if you only hit $100K or $50K?  You're still better off than you were before.\s\sSet another goal and hopefully you've learned something from your last experience.This made me tear up because I know this feeling so well. I made myself take a short walk when I wasnt taking care of myself and I remembering feeling so much better that I cried thinking I really should take care of myself.Damn now I’m depressed againYears ago my therapist gave me this gem: Don’t make perfect the enemy of the good.Care to elaborate more on this line? Very interesting to me.Well now I'm crying. I really needed this. Thank you OP.I like the idea of following an idea of positive path of least resistance. You want to improve already you want to be better than you are now. So you have a resistance towards staying the same or doing less to a certain degree. No need to beat yourself up for not taking on more than you can handle. Pacing yourself is just making the path of least resistance forwards and upwards. The little bits come back with compound interest if you would will yourself to believe that. It's okay to move as slow as is comfortable for you cause there is always a fire under your ass (or in your belly wherever you prefer your body fire to be - no judgement) whether you realize it or not there's some piece of you that prevents you from falling too low. If you're comfortable with going 'slow' aiming low can get you close enough to that fire to feel that comfort. And let yourself know remind yourself that you do want to move forward. Comfort can help you or it can destroy you. What matters is your relationship with it. How uncomfortable are you comfortable being? How uncomfortable are you being comfortable? I definitely don't phrase this particularly well. You can attempt to change faster than you're able to sustain and in my experience that can stunt youI really like that question ""How uncomfortable are you being comfortable?"" Because I know how uncomfortable I can be and have been. I do want to move forward. But depression and despair are hard to wallow through. Maybe the fire underneath is just the will to live and the need to survive which is really important. Thanks manTHIS! Helps me with my writing. Everytime I come up with a story in my head I will wanna perfect it ... In the end I end up doing nothing but visioning. It's better to start then to thinking about perfectionWow.TL;DR Something is better than nothing.This is a post that my wife came across and it really helped her. Now it has been something I have saved and referred back to many time in addition to sharing with a couple of friends. It is very worth the read!\s\shttps://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/comment/cdah4af?st=JS9TL8N0&sh=85f8dfd3Thank you so much for this. This speaks to my soul in a way I wish it wouldn't DarkA lot of times it is the small efforts we make that build momentum and then that 20% becomes a 32% and that makes all the difference in the world.Sometimes brushing teeth for 30 seconds is too long.This post encourages my procrastinating half-assing behavior and makes me feel better about myself and I don't like it one bit.That first sentence knocked me for a six. My 3 girls jumped years and the eldest got 100% score on her University entrance and then the bullying started. so I played doing everything the roundabout way homeschooling through secondary school for the younger two and part time university. Just trying to get every one up was the biggest challenge and constant reassurance and saying everything can be tried again and just hand up what you have done. The anxiety was and at times can still be palpable but we have gotten there and all 3 have double degrees and are going over seas next year. I am neither a kind or patient person but I realised very early on if they were going to do anything with their lives I would have to accept that nothing would be 100% and being happy was much more important.Except lifting weights. DO NOT LIFT WEIGHTS POORLY. \s\sSparsely sure. But not poorly. You can injure yourself significantly.This post made me realize I might be depressed The gifted kid stuff made me so narcissistic.  you’re among the top students in a high school.  There’s hundreds of high schools in a state.  Multiply that by 50 states.  Also graduating classes before and after you.  Then there’s the rest of the world... that makes you nothing.\s\sMy dad would constantly repeat “anything worth doing is worth doing the best you can” as I was growing up. My young neurotic perfectionist brain took it all the way to heart and with my inexperience I found it to be sound logic. Only in the last 5ish years (I’m 33) did I revisit it and realized that between that my mother’s insane expectations and guilt and one of my sister’s manipulative and judgmental attitude I’m pretty messed up. Not blaming them but I was held to impossible standards that my sisters never had. It was difficult when I was a kid and incredibly damaging and impossible in the long run. I’ve always been avoidant because of fear of “failure”. I missed out on a lot and I’m still just trying to figure out how to even begin getting over the shame and change my habits. I honestly feel like this is one of those things that will stick with me and guide much of my life. Thank you.Wayyy more motivating and useful than anything i've seen on r/motivational For me:\s\sNot self-harming for half a day is better than self-harming all day.I wish I had a porch. I can’t even express how very much I needed this. As a twice-exceptional (high iq + ADHD) I'm saving this shit as my wallpaper. Well I'm going to save it. We all know I'm not going to remember to swap my background when I'm done with this comment...I remember one time when I was young and had not grown yet I was fat. So I ordered a diet coke and saw that they had that grenadine stuff so I asked for some of that in it. And the lady said ""doesnt that like defeat the purpose ?"" It took me a while to realize what she meant. A coke with 20 calories is better than one with 120. She was just a jerk who wanted to make a kid feel dumb but that shit backfiredI have never been motivated by this sub. Until now. Thank you. I have a friend who decided tonight that she would take a year off of college due to her depression and she said she felt like a failure. Thanks for posting this. Sending it her way.I wish I had this influence in life earlier. I was raised by a narcissistic mom who constantly found flaws and said ""if you can't do it right dont do it at all.""I think I'm going to print this frame it and put it on my wall for motivation. I love this so much and constantly need the reminder. r/CPTSD needs to see this...Lower your expectations. Of everything everyone and yourself.\s\sAlso lower (some of) your standards. \s\sKey to contentment...Someone explain to me how this is a meme let alone a wholesome meme? This post just made me feel shittier.I needed to see this have left incomplete some semi-major assignments recently. Thanks.I needed this. Thank you.Thanks. This really helps me personallyOh crap! This hit me hard. It's so true. /r/JordanPeterson opinions?This not home and it's exactly what I needed. Thank you for sharing.""You're a piece of shit and I love you"" is the vibe I got from this. Thank youI have major depression and anxiety that I can’t medicate. I went through 15 years of extreme side effects before a doctor finally ordered genetic testing that showed my body can’t metabolize most medications correctly. The ones I can seem to exacerbate a minor heart issue I have and I’ve had doctors tell me it isn’t worth the continued use. I’ve had to learn to manage my mental health issues through sheer willpower without the use of medication.\s\sI can’t tell you how true this is. Just push through as much or as little as you can every single day. The important thing is that you never give up. Even if it gets so bad you have to give up you just pick yourself up as much as you can the next day. I've been unemployed for 6 weeks and this made me want to cry.I just did 30 minutes of exercise and this hit the spot hahah thank you OP! ❤️I read the book Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It about a year ago and it made such a huge difference in my mindset. Something so small as a corny affirmation really does borrow in and make an impact. It's a short book and I would recommend it to all of you.Awesome. Thank you. This is actually a really good perspective. Because it’s true when I am feeling all stressed and depressed it’s hard to work up the enthusiasm to do much of anything so I try to do a little but I always beat myself up about how I didn’t do the best or I didn’t do the most etc... but this is quite encouraging. Does smoking cigarettes relate into this?Learning the term ""frustrated perfectionist"" and then also the phrase ""Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good"" helped me a lot with this.I’m in grad school and the oft repeated mantra is (because grad students tend to be over achievers) “a good thesis is a done thesis”\s\sI try to live by that but it really doesn’t help me as much as I would hope :/ I’ve still spent the last several weeks crying every night because I don’t feel like I’m doing well enough........maybe someday Some folks at my lab take issue with my attitude that things are pretty much good unless I get kicked out my program can’t find a job and end up broke without health insurance. Til that point I’m mostly chilling. I have a naturally strong work ethic and I love my field so I work a lot but I have the impression that my bar for success is... much lower than everyone around me lol. Sometimes I get sort of anxious if I think my adviser gets mad at me but I believe advisers naturally get mad at their advised students bc someone who made it to that position probably just works all the time and has paranoia about getting scooped or something constantly so they’re on edge a lotI just got my masters and the aphorism that got me over the finish line was...\s\s\sCs get degrees.<3I completely understand what you're going through. While I was in grad school I prayed every night that God would not let me wake up in the morning. When I saw the sun I would start crying because I made it through the night. I got my degree finished my thesis and still felt like shit. Grad school is whole other beast. It gets better once you're out slowly but better. You may come out bruised battered and emotionally raw BUT you end up coming out. I blocked out many parts of grad school and can't even remember my thesis title. Stay strong and just get that paper plus those student loans 😉I’m in the same boat my friend. What makes me feel a bit better is I looked up how many people graduate from my university each year and I visualise myself as just one of the many. My thesis just one amongst hundreds. It’s a big deal for me but not for anyone else.\s\sAlso I don’t want to be one of those people who after graduating consatantly bring up their thesis or how they did in academia or school or whatever. It’s just a small piece of your education and honestly putting your self worth into one paper is not something that should be considred a goal. Thank you for giving this example because I was reading the thread thinking about my little work projects and this reminded me that the thing really weighing on me is my research proposal and seeing this specifically was like a sudden epiphany that I really could just get it done. \s\sI’m sorry it doesn’t help you as much but I can say what I’ve found through being an overachiever is that work that I think is absolutely terrible and that I’ve berated myself into fits over ends up being praised as better than average a lot of the time. So even if you feel like you’re half-assing it by your own standards you’re probably actually like 80%-assing it :)I get it. I am working very hard to get unstuck.....Waiting to find out if my dad had a stroke tonight and this hit me hard. Gonna go drink some tea.Thanks for this. Been feeling empty for some time now. There are happy days and sad days and weekdays at work are usually just fine. But I just don't have the energy to go all out. Barely going through the flow of everything. Lately I've been waking up past my alarm and that brief amount of panic makes me feel like it's worth waking up. But then at the end of the day when I turn off the lights and my phone is away I can't feel anything. Just an empty humming of the daily grind. Waking up to go to work so I can feed myself. Give money to my bro if needed. I have no direction in life and I don't feel any form of joy. Happy yes because of temporary distraction like manga or youtube videos. Im also usually floating. I've been trying to do my lessons (i work as a middle school teacher) for a week now and i barely finished anything. I suck at this. I suck at life. You can't suck at life brothe r because there is no one way to do life. Everyone hits a hard low. Just stay true to yourself and do it as you can instead of as you feel you should Holy. Shit. This is the main thing I have a huge problem with. In elementary and middle school I was a perfectionist and in high school now with everything harder and worse in general I’ll fall behind and do half and not turn it in and then I’ll fall behind everything and it just gets so overwhelming and idk why I never thought that I should just turn stuff in. I’ve turned in half done things and was like “cool I got credit thank god I did it” but I always forget that doing that is better and I need to try to do it more. Thank you for posting this. I’m saving this for a rainy day thanks friendThis is so oddly motivating!Commenting to save this helped me a lot. thanks. but what helped me the most was letting go of all expectations that people had of me and just enjoying myself. when i do yoga i ease into the stretch enjoying it and slowly move to the next asana. learning just to let go and enjoy everything made me more willing to to do things more and even improved my performance! just in case anyone reads this :) i've felt so lost for so long but it's okay don't feel pressured to do things to anyone else's beat. do what you want and enjoy it!Well that cured by depressionThis used to be a problem for me in school. If I didn't fully complete and assignment or homework I just wouldn't turn it in. Even if I only missed 1 question I wouldn't turn it in. I'd rather take a 0 than a 50.Love this so much thanks for sharingThis is the mindset that worked to help me become a high functioning person again. Depression was a hurdle for me and I never had the energy or inclination to do anything. I made a wonderful friend who helped me tackle normal things a little at a time and thanks to him I’m in college and joining the Navy in April.Holy shit I needed to hear thisI really wish we'd see more stuff like this in /r/wholesomememes and /r/GetMotivated \s\sMost of the stuff there just makes me feel ""ehh"" or worsedoesn't just work with depression ...\s\sAnxiety too !This speaks to me in a huge way. This speaks to me in too huge of a wayNot sure if it correlates but it reminded me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjATMi9yNd0 on the part of cleaning. ☀️🌟💗💖💌👑💎I honestly really needed this.Shit this really hit me. Am I depressed?For people with chronic crippling depression this is a good way to begin to take care of themselves.\s\sFor a majority of the people on Reddit who think this is sage advice they are just lazy fucks and it's just a justification for cutting corners instead of applying effort.This really resonates with me and something I’ve been trying to focus on. My new motto is “Done is better than Perfect.” I’ve let so many things sit unfinished (personally and professionally) for fear of not being able to devote resources to doing them perfectly only to never make progress on anything. Turns out most things don’t need to be perfect anywayThis is why I procrastinate because doing it last minute is better than not doing it at all .It's like they know my entire soulFuck. How long are you supposed to brush her teeth for?huhhh whoa.Also if it's hard for you you are strong for doing it no matter how trivial it seems to others.This! As long as you are doing and learning you aren't failing!Wow I didn't know how much I needed this til now. Thank you OP!It doesn’t apply when you’re in bed The word mediocre comes from a latin phrase that means half way up the mountain.  \s\s\sIt's better to be half way up the mountain than to be at the bottom complaining that it's too big to climb.  \s\s\sYou eventually want to reach the top but if you're half way it's still progress as long as it isn't the goal.Don't the posts here have to be memes?Is the Internet populated by gifted kids that turned into ""failures"" later on (and I mean that they perceive themselves as failures not that they actually are failures) cause I always see people relate super hard with these posts online but I can't think of anyone I know that fits the bill in real lifeKinda? I think there's a lot of people who excelled in an academic structure who have a hard time finding that same feeling outside that space. In the real world your performance or capability isn't easily ranked and the problems you're trying to solve typically don't have concrete answers. As such it's easy to find it hard to value yourself if you had built your self value around grades or other similar merits. That coupled with the debt that now comes with seeking higher education tends to leave very smart and capable people in a financial bind that takes years to be free of. In the end these things weigh on people's self worth and it's easy to see how they can fall into a depression as a result. Being told that you're smart ultimately has a negative impact on most kids. It teaches them that their value is in being smart which encourages them to be very risk averse. Why try and possibly fail when a lack of effort excuses failure more readily?\s\sObviously telling kids they're dumb is just as bad (or possibly worse). In general it's bad to complement somebody on what they are. It's more productive to complement someone based on what they do or attempt (""That's a good mark you must have worked hard"" is better than ""you must be smart"").You are probably friends with a lot more ""failures"" than you realize. Not sure what age you are but feeling a sense of failure (in some degree) has been a pretty common theme amongst a lot of my peers (millennials). Even the more (what I would call) successful ones harbor shreds of self doubt. It seems like we only ever talk about it on the internet though. As if depression has become this big inside joke. Welcome to reddit People fail to live up to their potential for all sorts of reasons.\s\sPersonally pretty much isolated myself from other people because I'm ashamed of how my life has turned out despite how much I had going for me at one time.\s\sI do talk to my best friends again now(after losing touch for years) and have a job and what not. But I'm still kind of ashamed of my life/self.\s\sIf I had a more booming social life and things going on besides working and sleeping I'd probably spend a lot less time on reddit. But here I am.We’re all in our rooms having not showered or eaten or gone outside.Lotsa clever college age people on here. Particularly the introverted type (which is why you see less of them IRL). Among the main demographics on Reddit.\s\sUniversity is the first serious freedom in a lot of people’s lives. Particularly the sheltered shy smart types. Suddenly no one is taking attendance. You can game all day with no consequences. Helps if you have excellent upper-middle class financial support.\s\sThese are also the kind of people who did very well at high school without trying. Just absorbed stuff without every studying or doing homework. Figures that they could afford to miss an early class here or there and still be fine. Hell just learn from the textbook they’re good at that. Problem is you can’t absorb stuff if you don’t go to class so you don’t learn.\s\sThen exams hit and you barely scrape by. Parents aren’t happy but figure it’s just adapting to university. And you soldier on. Problem is university is all about learning how to learn. And you’re not doing that just scraping by. So you start failing classes. And that hits your will to go to class drags your mental health down. From there it’s a downward spiral that is *very* hard to escape. Eventually you have to drop out and now you’re just a college drop out on Reddit.\s\sI lucked out. When rock bottom hit and the university finally kicked me out I had a way out. I saw it coming. My mental heath was salvageable. I also had a childhood dream that my parents hated. But at that desperate juncture they couldn’t exactly say no. So I had a plan and the means to do it.\s\sNow I’m a trainee pilot and a bastard.\s\sNot everyone is so fortunate. If you don’t have a dream if you don’t have a plan if you get depressed you can stay in that hole forever.\s\sMost of my peers in failure found themselves. Some didn’t and I almost had to bury one of them.\s\sIf you’re identifying with this I don’t have an answer unless you’re Canadian and wanna fly in which case PM me. Still the first rule of tactics is *do something*. If the current path isn’t working it might be time for a change. The military was essential to fixing my mentality but I’m sure it could make others worse. The answer may be as simple as a chat with a therapist (they’re excellent talkers). Whatever you do don’t stay the current unworkable course.\s\s...sorry for the essay but apparently I had some baggage to work through. Thanks for the outlet (and seriously if I sound like you dear reader PM me and we’ll compare notes).In order to be considered gifted you need to be in the top 2% of the population (IQ of 130 or more). That’s 1 in 50 people. That means that in a school with 1000 students there might be 20 bona fide gifted people. Around the world it’s 140 million gifted people more or less. 140 million people who are told they’re gonna be the next Einstein or Mozart that their lives are gonna be easy peasy because they learned to read at the age of two and who eventually have to face the many challenges of life unprepared for them. And since many internet sites tend to skew towards educated people from developed countries or from decent financial situations in developing ones it’s more likely to find gifted people here.I think what happens if the kid starts out gifted because they’re hitting milestones early gets used to being a standout then everyone else catches up and they’re no longer special just above average. Went to school with a few kids like this. Was mildly one myself in that I had super advanced reading skills at 4yrs old (I could read fluently) so I was always the narrator etc in plays but as an adult there are no “super advanced” readers so my claim to fame is nada. I was also put up a grade in school which also means jack now. Sometimes kids are pushed into a path that is not their talent.  So  depression and failure ensues.  It's super confusing to be ignored at home to be told that's you're stupid to be treated like you literally don't matter...then you go to school and you're told for the first time that you *are* actually smart. You find things to excel in and you're validated for the first time in your life. Smart enough to frustrate some of your teachers who can't find enough for you to do. Smart enough for other teachers to celebrate your achievements. All you had to do was show up and complete the work. It was easy.\s\sNothing else has been that easy.At my first primary school I was always told I was super smart and really good at school. When I switched schools I couldn’t cope with not being the best and it set me up for a big spell of Depression in high school. From personal experience people that fit the bill can be really good at looking like they don't. A lot of people don't realize people have issues because on the outside they look like they don't.it's the usual trend of people blaming their failures on something out of their control just in a different color than usualI relate to this but I wouldn't say I was gifted. I was able to easily coast by in highschool but that all came crashing down in university. I think a lot of people experience similar things.It’s because the gifted kids were all told when they were in elementary school and maybe middle school (hey maybe even high school) that we were extremely smart and that they were getting excellent grades and that they were amazing etc. Eventually they became more of an average person or realize it wasn’t true. I know for me in elementary school I was the “gifted kid” but by high school I was your average kid getting decent grades. \s\sIt could even be college when you realize you weren’t the gifted kid. I saw a great comment up above that describes the college dropout. Oh you know them. They would just never admit it to you. A lot of them were never actually gifted. They were just slightly above average and let it go to their headBeing labeled as “gifted” led to more harm than good imoI feel this morning in my core jeez[deleted]Your stepmum probably did this to make herself feel superior to you because obviously she felt threatened that you were smarter than her. And shame on your dad for letting her make you feel that way. My dad always said that 99% of a job done is still an incomplete job. This is the same man that said whenever I had any sort of issue or question to ""use my own best judgement"".\s\sThanks for the input dad even when all I needed was a slight bit of guidance you still failed. Glad I used my best judgement and stopped asking family for help.Holy shit\s\sMind blown emoji\s\sThanks!this touched my soul and it describes perfectly my bouts with depression. Its better to do it poorly than not do it at all. Wow. Interesting as I grew up ( born early '80's) parents always said if you were going to do something might as well do it well. \s\s\sSays a lot about our current timeline Post saved. \s\sStill feels like it could be bad advice when it comes to buying stocks or ... Being more prepared before doing something? Nvm can't really think of anything As someone who is taking up freelance writing this makes a lot of sense. I get so overwhelmed that I keep telling myself that I can't do some huge paper or article but I forget that everything starts with a word. Then another. Then another. then another and then you've hit your groove. This hits me hard. I need to do better. Damnit I’m trying to avoid writing a paper okay! Leave me to self sabotage in peaceI really needed this today. Life has been so hard lately. I feel like I can’t snap out of it *Depression fading*I just wanted to thank whoever gave me gold on this.  This message got me off my ass to brush my teeth it hit me really hard and I only wanted to share in Hope's that maybe I could help one other person tonight and to know I could have possibly helped thousands of u guys was a good feeling when I haven't felt a good feeling in a while :) Yeah when that person needs CPR 1 chest compression is better than none.  Or when a person needs medication but has no money give em a midol.I burnt out a couple months ago we got a puppy and he’s pretty much the only reason I started getting out of bed in the morning. I might be raising a pup poorly but he’s definitely motivated me to start trying to have some self care as well as care for something else. I did one set of five burpees the other day and I’m sore. \sI have a baby and can’t leave my house to exercise. We are in a spot where we have little money (as many young families do). \sI have a heart condition and I can tell it’s getting worse. Anyways I downloaded a workout app and did some burpees and lunges. \s\sJust do what you can I guess. Would be nice to have a bow flex in the garage or something. But five burpees are better than nothing. When I felt defeated after five I didn’t know I’d feel sore today. This is literally the only reason I have a  college degree. I never left a question blank on a test even if I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. 1% credit is better than zero.Those who consider themselves gifted kids were rarely as smart as they thought they were to be bluntly honestWell the term ""gifted "" come from a program in American schools where you have to take a test and then they tell you ""you are gifted"" so. It's not about what they consider themselves As someone who basically sabotaged my own degree out of misguided and perfectionism. I feel this.

I’ve been dealing with depression for 12 years now and thought for the past 2 years I’ve been ok because I’m not suicidal anymore.  Reading this I realize I have a long way to go. Moved into my house two years ago and it’s still a mess and like I almost just moved in because I keep saying oh I’ll get to it and never have the energy to. This motivates me to want to do a little bit and help myself. I respect this post. A lot better than the usually half baked crap on here. *my old ICT teacher begs to differ.*Our family motto is “Done is better than good.”This one hurtedI've spent all of my day so far arguing with someone. What a waste of a life. Then I read this and decided not to keep going because who cares. And it made things different hopeful changed my perception of what it might mean to have gotten out of bed today.\s\sSometimes I see those moments in movies when the person decides to stop arguing gets this kind look on their face and hugs who they were arguing with.\s\sAlways makes me cry if I feel like crying. You just.. lay down your arms and turn the ugliest moments into ones worth living. Into the beautiful ones. I will rather this say that anything worth doing is worth doing to the best of your ability.\s\sIn my line of work doing something poorly means the next person might have to fix what you've done and that could end up costing more..“Anything worth doing is worth doing badly” - G.K. Chesterton (that’s probably where the quote came from)I really needed to hear this. Thanks for sharing.My grandmother would scold me for saying any of this.Can we talk about how being told you’re “gifted” as a kid kinda fucks you up later in life?Hey something I can actually use.I needed this. Thank you xWhew that's essentially the entire foundation of muh meme painting project.  Doing something stupid and dumb and embarrasing is better than not having done it.  Eveidence that you existed in any form is better than nothing.  Even wrote a haiku about it:\s\sNothing is perfect;\s\s\sand anything is better.  \s\s\sTime is entropy.  \s\sUnless youre building a bridge.   The structural integrity is important and it could cause many deaths. I'm not really a former Gifted Kid but have been struggling with depression for a long while now. It comes and goes and this is one of my mantras (not exact words) every time I feel going down that what I call deep trench. I would always tell myself ""just do something"" or ""one thing at a time"". I'd struggle getting out of bed so I'd force myself to sit on the couch instead. I'm too ""exhausted"" to clean the house even though I've been sleeping for hours and hours I'd find a way to wash a bowl and a spoon I used and sometimes that would be enough. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sReading this realizing I'm not alone in that struggle and that what I have been doing is something other people are doing too makes me feel so exponentially better and happier. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sSo thank you for sharing this. I hope more people get to read this and realize what I realized. I loved reading this. It loosens the tightness in my chest to know that others bargain with themselves the same way I have had to. And while I wind my way through this umpteenth dip slowly diggin myself out one five minute tidy at a time... I will think of this and feel a little less lonely. So thank you for sharing. Really loving the double-space-after-the-end-of-sentence vibe.I didnt get a permission slip for this feels trip20% clean balls are still dirty balls.....and no one likes dirty balls.....no one.Going into the last quarter of my freshman year of college I needed this for sure. Thank you Thank you for sharing this. I needed this. This is so true for school. Turning in shit assignments is so much better than not turning anything in. If you make a 50 on an assignment it only takes a single 100 to pull it up to passing if you make a 0 it takes 3. Turn in crap if you have to but always turn something in.I'm saving this into my phone in case the depression era comes back.Except for deadlifts.\s\sPlease do not do deadlifts if your form is poor. \s\sPR or the ER budAs a former GiftedKid™ whose performance in a quiz today wasn't that hot this is what I needed to see. \s\sThank youMy mom passed away last week. I’ve been a mess and haven’t been great at cleaning eating and hygiene. This was really good timing for me to read. Thank you. This post gave me the drive to cram for me test that I'm definitely going to fail tomorrow. Thank you. This is my favorite post ever thank youThank you so much for this. I feel this everyday.I came to same conclusion some time ago and it literally changed my life. If you really think about it there's no such thing as a perfect job. It really depends on the person who is looking at it. Nobody's perfect :)I needed to read this. I just got out of a huge legal thing with my ex and it took everything in me to get through it. I ended up missing a lot of work and I have absenteeism issues anyways. Because of said absenteeism issues I don’t have paid time off and lose money every time I don’t work. I justified my recent absences saying to myself at least I don’t get paid and I am useless being there in this stressed/anxiety condition. I had a talk with my boss this week and she said the owner needs me there regardless. The fact that I don’t get paid doesn’t matter to him. The fact that I am there at all is what matters to him. I hate the idea of sitting at my desk when I can’t focus and every minute feels like hours but apparently I just have to be there. Reading this helped me understand that a bit better. Doing 30-40% of my normal productivity on some days is better than 0%.I just went through this with my boss as well. I hate that they’d rather have a warm rear end in the seat than a fully productive employee (when I am well rested and feeling good). But yet they want me there even if I am not at my best. I know you probably aren’t reading comments anymore but I had to share this with you anyway because this spoke deeply to me. Sorry for the length.\s\sI used to be a singer. Nothing spectacular but I was decent enough to win a talent show and sing in a few bands throughout high school. At one point I auditioned for the voice didn’t make it through but had a great time. I would mostly just sing for myself. It was my absolute favorite thing to do in the car. Just see what notes I could hit try and imitate Ed Sheeran really belt it out and have a good time. I loved seeing the look on people’s faces when they would hear me for the first time being a skinny kid that could belt out these high notes.\s\sAs I got older and refined my skills more I became a bit of a perfectionist with it. I got better and better but something made me lose my passion for it. In college I had a group of “friends” I’d known since high school. These weren’t the type of friends that would say things like “dude you should break out the guitar and sing” at parties. They hated when I would because they felt it gave me an unfair advantage with girls (I promise that part is relevant) which I never felt it did (results speak for themselves).\s\sSo I basically stopped singing for people. When someone would ask me to play I’d say things like “maybe later” or “not right now.” I desperately wanted to share my singing with everyone (I’m tearing up as I type this part) but I didn’t want my friends mocking me while I did (which they started doing every single time).\s\sFast forward about 5 years. I basically all but completely stopped singing for anyone but myself and my fiancé. One day I was playing some basketball and took a hard shoulder to my chin. The impact turned my neck giving me a contusion on my larynx (right on my vocal chords) as well as on my eardrum and gave me a concussion. It’s been 4 years since that and I still can’t sing like I used to. Physically can’t. No matter how hard I try (full on sobbing typing this part). I can still hit lower notes and have good control as long as I don’t try to go too high (have about 2/3 of the range I used to) but my vocal chords can’t even last a full song before they give out. I can still feel the bump on my throat.\s\sI’ve had multiple uncontrollable emotional breakdowns as a result because something I took for granted was taken away from me in an instant. I never realized how much pride I took in being able to sing above average. Now I don’t even try to sing. Not even by myself in the car.\s\sYour post though it might not be OC is something I have never seen and spoke to me very deeply. \s\sI’m gonna start singing again. I don’t care if it sounds like a cat fighting a trash can I’m gonna do it for me. Thank you for sharing.\s\sdamn i needed thisThis might keep me alive today. The kick I needed to finally begin learning drawing fundamentals. No more fear of not achieving perfect results first time around in every lesson.Man I wish I read this this morning instead of as I'm getting ready for bedThose two are the same if you spend all day in bed but reading this and thinking “I’ll brush my teeth next time I have to get up to pee instead of holding it in and never moving.”I needed this kick in the butt today. Thank you. Oh my god I needed every word of this. I’ve literally been depressed anxious and late for so long because of my perfectionism.The amount of actually gifted kids that were let down by society and the people around them is staggering. Such a fucking waste.I need to learn how to do this.This song really helps me when I get overwhelmed by the urge to do everything perfectly.\s\s[How to do the thing](https://youtu.be/czcBDTjG1js)\s\sDoing it badly is so much better than not doing it at all because you're waiting to do it until you're sure you can do it perfectly. Stop waiting do the thing and do it badly!Thank you for sharing this. Been struggling recently and I think this is just what I needed to hear.I speak two languages properly.\s3 more poorly...I live by this nowI needed this today. This would be welcomed on r/chronicpain Thank you I needed a reminder of this tonight thank youThe journey of 0 steps starts and stops with sitting on your ass.P!gap“Do or do not there is no try.”\s\sYou know what? Yoda was full of garbage when he said that.I get where you’re coming from but it’s actually a more positive quote than you think. “Doing” isn’t succeeding it’s attempting until you succeed (at whatever level) & “doing not” is completely giving up. “Trying” the way Luke was is attempting with full confidence that you will fail without real intention of success. Luke believed that lifting the X-Wing was impossible so when he tried it was & he gave up. Yoda did it because he had built his confidence by taking small steps so that when it was time to move a gigantic starfighter it wasn’t much more difficult than moving a small stone.\s\sTLDR: Doing is attempting each step & recovering from each failure until you succeed (sometimes just in a small way) “trying” (in the context of this quote not in the general “synonym for attempting” sense) is attempting with the assumption of failure.My eighth grade science teacher used the analogy: “What’s better half a pie or no pie at all?” Better to turn it in late and get 50% than not turn it in at all and get a 0%I struggle with the same things this is really helpful. I always have struggled with things like cleaning my room brushing my teeth go to bed early. I have heard whole life that I'm just lazy and don't want too. Now I'm 23 and diagnosed with ADHD. Which my little brother also has. However with me it doesn't outs itself with the hyperenergetic energy like it does with my brother. That's why I only found out thatat I have it. It is in my mind. The psychiatrist who diagnosed me told me: "" you whole life with everything you do you have been swimming against the stream "". This made everything fit so well! I finally don't feel like that lazy guy everyone told me I was. I can do shit I can handle this world. I will do it my way! I'm now on track to go to university after starting at the lowest school rank in my country.\s\sYou aren't lazy you aren't a failure. Your mind can be in the way of what you want too achieve without you knowing it! Every small step is a step.\s\sFor me a big realisation was that I am allowed to make my own rules. If I have 3 days to complete a task that takes me 8 hours I would do it like this: day 1 procrastinate and do fuck all day 2 same and feel bad about it all those 2 days. Then do it somewhere on day three. But NOW I have such a great solution I just accept I will do it on day 3. And instead of feeling bad all first 2 days I am doing the things I really want on those days!Everyone's finding this relatable...Are...Are you guys okay?No dude that's kinda the point. But I think we're getting better.really needed this going through a shitty breakup with a girl i’ve been with for almost a year. tough to even get myself out of the house unless it’s for work. Damn I really needed this today thank you op.I needed this thank you. \s\sI want to be ok but I don’t even know what ok is anymore. I just try to make it through each day. Stuff like this is why I stay subbedI'm currently taking a creative writing class. I don't... well I don't really *read* stories. I get most of my entertainment from TV and video games. So maybe a class where I have to write 20000 words of a novel-length story was not the wisest idea. It's hard.\s\sTurns out the class loves my dialogue! The setting needs more description and I need to get into the heads of my characters more but that's all part of becoming better.\s\sDon't be afraid to be bad at something. At best you're better than you thought. And at the worst you've got nowhere to go but up.Wow.\s\sI never knew that I needed to hear something before. \s\sSigned a depressed former ""gifted kid.""My favorite version of this is from Tokyo Drift. “50% of something is better than 100% of nothing”“Better than it was” is the thought getting me through at the moment - even though I feel like I’m failing some days if I make it better than it was I’m still making an effort- half arsed house work “it’s better than it was” attempting to do my my hair “it’s better than it was” you get the drift ""No zero days"" is the mantra that got me through depression. No matter what do *something* each day. Even if it is just one trivial thing that's still more than nothing. You can't be worthless if all your days are net positive no matter how small that positive is it still has value.Oh god. I've been struggling with exactly this since I graduated from collegeThank you for sharing this.Oh yes this is good.This post is amazing and I wish I had seen it years ago. It a) makes me not feel so alone and b) reminded me to brush my teeth and wash my face. I'm going to go for a walk tomorrow in order to leave my apartment.This is the kind of content I want more of. This is the kind of content we *need.*It's not a meme though.To me this sounds like the paralysis of analysis. You get stuck planning out perfection and end up with little or nothing actually done.\s\sWhen programming this same thing happens. Best practice is chopping something together that works them iterating on that. You'll never get perfection on your first go.I have experienced this first hand. Thank you for sharing. I’m having a lot of trouble with my classes right now because my mental health is really struggling and I think this could really help me today. Thanks :)llThank you very much for this. I'm another previous perfectionist here that didn't want to get things done if they we're not 100% done.\s\sI found that in a lot of ""smarty pants"" societies people don't want to make a fool of themselv s by doing something shoddily so they don't end up doing anything at all. \s\sIt is only once I believed that everyone is a beginner at some point at any age that I started getting a move on with life: started rock climbing going out to bars singing cold approaching girls even. Travelling also forces you to be a dumb tourist and do awkward shit all the time so that helps as well (plus MASSIVE amounts of perspective oh my God)\s\sOnce you make a fool of yourself on a daily basis and realize how much you evolve and learn you find how much procrastination and perfectionism has been holding you back. Never again.I just went and put some dishes in the sink to soak. I haven't cleaned in ages and I've got dirty dishes everywhere and clothes getting more and more wrinkled on the couch. But there's three plates and a bowl soaking in some water and after they soak (they've been dirty for a *long* time) I'm going to go scrub them with a sponge.\s\sThank you for posting this.I can't express how much I relate to this. I am now trying to stand again on my own to feet trying to restart my life trying to do everything from zero again. I am still struggling to comprehend this. Still wonder if anything I do even matter. Now I read this I know it matters.Every time one of these posts comes around I realize yet again that I'm still depressed and I still can't do anything about it. \s\sI'm stuck on finding a therapist. I've been putting it off for a whole year now. I'm just gonna be vulnerable here for a second because everyone here seems nice most of the time. \s\sHow can I find a therapist that isn't religious that takes my insurance? I can sort by every type of religion on my insurances site but I can't sort by ""not."" I know I need help. I want help but I'm so afraid of trusting people and I don't kow how to find someone to trust. \s\sPeople who have found help can you help me out?You really have to shop around. Even if they’re religious make it clear that you’re not and it would make you uncomfortable if they brought it up so to please not. \s\sI HIGHLY recommend a cognitive-behavioral therapist if you can find one. I tried talk therapy for years no avail. Once I started CBT my life seriously changed so so much. I’m still a fuckin mess but I wouldn’t even recognize myself six months ago if that version of me were here today. I needed this today. Thank you Thank you for sharing!! So true but so easily forgotten! And you don’t have to feel badly about it later. You’re not cheating or shirking and it doesn’t reflect poorly on you. I needed this desperately today!  I’m in the middle of the WORST depression bout of my life. I did a couple of loads of laundry today and was so frustrated with myself because a million other chores still needed to be done. Two loads of laundry is better than zero loads. God I want to get better so badly!!! this sounds like an excuse high school senior would say when he only wrote 2 pages of an essayRecovering anxious perfectionist here I love this. What steps did you take to finally break this stupid cycle? ""The perfect is the enemy of the good.""\s\s  -VoltaireI need to print this out and put it somewhere I can see it every day.my constitutional law professor used to say the principle for considering changes to the law is ""don't let the perfect stand in the way of the good"".  Same overall concept as what's espoused here.  Once you get that mindset and apply it to life everything gets progressively better. Thank you for posting this. I needed it more than I knew. I was laid off from my job two weeks ago. The past week I haven't cleaned I've barely worked out and I've struggled to eat regularly or healthy.\s\sThis is what I needed right now. Thank you.Same actually. Laid off early January. Lost my girlfriend and all my motivation to do anything except smoke and play guitar and even that's starting to just depress me more. Just counting down the days till I get to go back to work.. My husband and I both got laid off three days before Christmas. He has industry connections and was working again by New Year's. I've sent out endless resumes and have only been on two interviews. Depression is super bad. I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't find something very soon.  \s\s(Obviously I'm very thankful he found work so quickly it just doesn't help me feel great about my lack of prospects.)Dude I'm on my fourth week of being laid off. Go outside. Absolutely do whatever it takes to get some fresh air and a change of scenery.\s\sMy depression was in full swing two weeks in and that third week was brutal but I scheduled a lunch date with an ex coworker and we sat outside of a coffeeshop for hours. I feel so much better now.\s\sEdit: this made me roll out of bed to go brush my teeth. Because I wasn't gonna do it. As someone who recently lost their job (I wasn't laid off. I was harassed then fired from a job) I thought I'd pass on what helped for me:\s\s1.  Compassion. You might be replaying what you could have done better (like sucking up to the boss or working more hours). Could you have done better? Sure. But that's true of everyone and everything *in theory.* As long as you did your best with what you had at the time you did as best as anyone could have. If you haven't forgive yourself.\s2.  Time. It's a cliche but time heals everything. A breakup a loss in the family getting laid off etc. Some things will always hurt but they'll hurt less and less as you heal and healing isn't always something you can force. Sure it might still ache later but it won't run your life. Also every time I thought life had finally beat me down and that everything was over time proved otherwise. It'll happen for you too!\s3.  Effort. Much like this post it's about just doing what you can. When I was in the thick of it some days I spent all day doing job applications. Some days I only played pokemon and watched YouTube. Some days I cried and slept and maybe only cleaned some dishes. But each of those days I did *something.* Playing pokemon helped my mood and resting helped me heal. All of it is valid.People recommended that I do something work-related everyday but I disagree. Some days won't be related to the job search and that's okay. Essential even.\s4.  Go outside even just for a 5-minute walk around the block. It'll help especially if you take in the outside air lol.\s5.  Sleep as much as you can. If you're like most people you were probably overworked and stressed before it all happened. Now's a time to heal and sleeping makes you happier and more effective 😊\s6.  Volunteer if you can. When I wasn't applying for jobs I'd go volunteer for something that I was interested in. The people and work made me feel impactful and important after feeling dehumanized by the whole thing. It also helped that I got to meet great people.\s\sThere's surely more but these *saved* me during those times. I hope these help even a little 🙂I was laid off almost a month ago and if I hadn’t just moved in with my boyfriend I think I would be way worse off. It gives me motivation to at least take a shower and clean before he gets home and try to look semi presentable. Losing this job is one of the hardest things that’s happened to me in years job searching just feels like an endless stream of rejection until it’s over. Ugh. Truly wishing you a quick job search and a great new position somewhere!all it takes is a step forward. i like to give myself a simple task that is easy to break me of my negative cycles “at least if i just drink this water i know i’m doing something healthy and helpful for myself” and it can help inspire more steps. good luck my man!Me too my friend. I’m in the exact same boat. We all have times where we hibernate. It's natural. When you're ready start moving. When you're moving then you can reevaluate. Take your time. You'll get there when you get there. I start my first week of unemployment tomorrow...I am already on meds for depression and anxiety. I'm so afraid of what this is going to do to me but I'm finding comfort in the idea of giving myself a break. Just for a week then I'll hit the job hunt again. I wish you the best of luck in getting back on your feet. I experienced the same thing but now I have a job again after 3 months. There is land behind horizon friend!\sPlease disregard my handle I am being sincere. I had to quit my dream job out of college due to my overwhelming health issues (primarily physical but anxiety and depression are becoming more than I can take). It’s been a rough few weeks. This helps a little I’m going to drink some water now. For you and the op\s\sI quit my job it's been over two months and I'm still barely functioning. I don't regret it I knew I'd eventually quit it was a toxic work environment and one situation broke the camels back. I didn't however expect the depression and life reflection that followed.\s\sThis was my only job ever I literally grew with the company. After almost a decade 19-29 I don't have anything to show for it and I can't put my life in perspective. \s\sBut this post it made things a little better. All I know is one day I'll look back at this moment and remember it was the spark that fueled everything else. Keep on trucking. Good luck friend! I'm rooting for ya! :)You're not alone in that dude. I lost close to thirty pounds over the last two and a half months just from not eating don’t do it to yourself man please. I worked really hard to put on some weight and now all that work is gone don’t let yourself fall into the same trap. PROGRESS NOT PERFECTION!!!! My motto for 2019.Disagree. Adam Levine showed a 3 second clip of Spongebob thinking it was enough.What’s that saying? In order to do something right you have to do it wrong 100 times?Thanks op I needed this in so many ways you are an og opI drove halfway to the store then came back with nothing.Honestly one of my friend shared this on fb last night when I was feeling like trash and didn't want to go get my daily exercise in. I read that and thought ""No one is saying I *have* to run while I'm out... I can just walk... Even if I only go for 15 minutes..."" so I went out. I walked my 30 minute circuit and called it good. It was the only thing that got me working towards my goals yesterday but I worked towards them. Just a walking step instead of a running leap yesterday.I routinely deal with this kind of thing based on my depression. I hardly ever clean my room barely take care of myself I have no motivation to do anything and I constantly fall behind in school. (I’m a junior in college btw). \sThis is the kind of reminder that I need to hear.  Self maintenance is something that I have a lot of trouble with and so just doing something is an accomplishment. This was really good to hear. Makes me feel less guilty for failing to do things normal people can do without a second thought.Why am I crying on reddit right nowWait we’re supposed to be brushing our teeth for two minutes??!!This is life changing. I think I just discovered the solution to a problem I didn't realize I had that's really been holding me back.Self destruction is pretty much the only power we get. Why not use it?I really needed this today. Being a teacher and going through seasonal depression is such a crazy thing. I’m “on” during the day for the kids but have a hard time doing everything else including the basic necessities. Everyday is a new battle but I’m slowly getting back. Do what you can when you can.I think this has stuck a chord with so many people including myself. Thanks for posting. Time to go skydiving Damn dude that made me cry . Having MS this right here is what gets me through alot of days. Damn son just gave my life a montra[deleted]I dont enjoy it but i understand why people do :)[removed]Yup hahaTbh Bieber and Rebecca Black hate was more like 2010. The internet has kinda forgotten about them.Was? Lmao the internet is as trash as it ever was. And as beautiful as it ever was. Was? It got a hell of a lot dumber since then...So crazy this is the second MC post I’ve seen on the front page today after I played it for hours today for the first time in 6 ish years Im a 22 and just got minecraft after years of wanting it and watching my favorite youtubers (yogscast people) play it. I have no shame. Even got a friend to join me Man minecraft will always be the shit. Played on a server with some friends earlier this year that was so fun. Then some friends of a friend joined started using cheats had to ban them they left the friend left the server died. :(Recently bought it again for PS4 so I can finally enjoy life againWat... Minecraft is super popular what is he even talking about? Memes making fun of Minecraft or what? Everything gets meme'd...I'm 32 I've played and loved it since it came out and I've never been aware the internet hated it.There is so much new stuff now... I might buy it when I get a laptop later in the year!It’s fun but just like any other game franchise in history: too much exposure can lead some to believe the game to be cancerous: Undertale Fortnite Fire Emblem Awakening. \s\sIf a game is good then fair enough but don’t hate it because it’s popular. If your favourite underground game suddenly became famous overnight and was lauded the world over would you immediately declare it dead and move on to another game? Fun fact: Minecraft still has more monthly players than FortniteHonestly any game is good. Not just minecraft. FuckI heard someone else say this but Millennials hating on things like Minecraft and Fortnite is the first step in their transformation into the old grumpy generation that think all of the new hip stuff is bad and always insist that their thing was better.Minecraft isn't hip or new thoReminds me of that wholesome greentext about anon liking Minecraft a lot which got to the front page yesterday!Awesome :)I used to love minecraft. Unfortunately they have changed it so much recently that I dont know how to play anymore. All these updates make it an entirely different experience to what I used to play when I was 14.Have they really changed it that much? I've played for a few years now and never felt like it's so drastically different that I couldn't continue. The basics are still the same you mine you craft and recipies don't really seem any different either (at least not the basic ones).Yeah thats why i only play like at the LATEST 1.8You can play it on older versions though I always play around 1.8.9 but never higher.They really didn't change much and the featured they add are usually really cool. The only thing you'd be ""forced"" to deal with is the combat update and even then once you're used to it it's pretty goodMillions of people over the world are playing a video game about mining?!\s\sPfft! What a buncha lemmings...[deleted]Its chill broski some youtuber said that you can't actually not like fortnite or minecraft  because if you do ur just jumping on the hate train. but that's stupid. I dislike both games and I don't care if anyone likes them. I get mad at my friends for playing just because I want to play with them but I don't want to play what they are playing.Exactly. I just picked it up again and I kept feeling rlly embarrassed to be playing it. Minecraft is litTisThe game itself is great and very well made it's really part of the fan base they make fun ofYeah but that also leads to people blaming the game in some senseIt's so annoying when people laugh at people for playing certain games.fucking mining and building housesDang ol silverfish*screams in Canadian*I ain't ever seen this before!Yay dood 🥑INFERNAL RESINDang it[Context for those who don't get the reference.](https://clips.twitch.tv/PatientHelpfulDiamondRiPepperonis)\sI have two ""guilty pleasures"" Minecraft and pewdiepieI don't think Pewds can be considered too guilty of a pleasure anymore since it's kinda the majority of <25s that resonate with him moreso and the >25s that are more towards to media when it comes to Pewdiepie.Yummy'Cept we don't hate Minecraft users in general just the shitty YouTubers and people building dicks on servers.Soon people will be saying the same thing about fortnite.Im 19 coming up to 20 and Minecraft will always have a special place in my heart and games modded Minecraft gives the game so much longevity in my opinion but vanilla is unrivaled fun to some of the other games out there I hate it that people on the internet shamed the game but i will always love itI thought people loved Minecraft when did players start catching shit for it? I’ve never played it but used to watch my brother play it and I thought it looked coolDon't forget the music! Sweden Subwoofer lulluby Hagglestorm Mice on venus Wet hands i can go on.[deleted]The game is seriously one of the greatest ever created simply for the sheer concept of it. It is such a simple concept but one that is expanded upon so deeply it can go from being a simple “gather materials and build something” game to a full-blown D&D-like adventure.\s\sBut once Microsoft bought it and started marketing it for kids it became popular to hate on it. Same thing happened to Fortnite. It’s like vaping or Drake it’s just popular to hate it so no one wants to admit they enjoy it.When things become popular they get more hate. Whether it's because more people know about it and can be vocally opposed or it's people who originally embraced it who are now bitter that they can't feel special for knowing about a hidden gem. \s\s\sThey also really hate when kids begin to like things because kids are idiots and ruin everything. And who wants to share interests with a kid right? So there are lots of reasons why Minecraft Fortnite etc. get the hate but many aren't necessarily fair critiques. I wish in general for all games people would have this attitude. Reddit is probably the #1 contender for people trying to convince you that you are wrong for not abiding to some circlejerk about a game that the hive mind dislikes.And it didn't have lame loot boxes to get more stuff at high cost I spent years making a ~1000 command block adventure map near the end of the Minecraft golden age and it was promptly forgotten to time. Taught me a thing or two about impermanence.I think I've had it for a long time. It was Survival test survival bête maybe? I still throw maybe 30 hours a year into it around patch time. At this point it's the game version of MS paint... Almost an essential./r/AccidentalFrenchHahaIt's like a staple your rightMinecraft is great it's just the typical ""elitist"" gamers. Same folks who have Fortnite; something is popular so let's hate it for no reason.I agree with tumblr user silverhawk. Minecraft is a good game and I don’t like how I feel like I shouldn’t play it because I’m an adultBedwars was the shitGod bless Minecraft...Personally I never understood the appeal of Minecraft but I would never disparage someone for playing a game they love. Lots of people can’t understand the hundreds of hours I’ve spent playing Total War:Warhammer.I have a very passionate hatred for cringe culture. If they're not hurting anyone let people enjoy things. Yes!![deleted]I didn't realize anyone thought Minecraft was cringy.Yeah and it seems like they're just making up shit to cringe about these days. Like the tiniest little thing they just flip out about. The absolute worst of it is stuff like furries where they pick out the like 5% of super weird shit and make the millions of impressionable kids who watch it think all of the people in that group are like that [deleted]I know right it's so cringy people need to stop it Yeah. I think that was the case for games like cuphead fnaf etc. just let people enjoy their damn games!To be fair the internet will make you feel bad about almost anything if they want to.There isn’t anything more relaxing than getting into single player survival and just playing.\s\sUp until you hear the tsssssssss...I never knew what the fuck I was doing ....I have never played it and don't get it but people made fun of it just like they now make fun of Fortnite. It's popular with people who are younger than them so it's automatically uncool TrueWell I think like with Fortnite Minecraft was ruined by you tubers who would just spam low effort videos to live off of its popularity.I would argue the big difference between Minecraft and MOBA/BR is that it's not competitive and much less toxic It's still a great game but it was destroyed by Micro$oft and silly ""family friendly"" youtubers ""playing"" (acting) in their super-modded pre-made maps. I have a private server (overclocked raspberry pi with free DDNS...) where I still play 1.12 with friends.How was it ""destroyed"" by Microsoft?\s\sThey are still maintaining the Java version and after jumping back in after many years I couldn't help but be utterly impressed by the changes that happened under Microsoft's ownership.\s\sIt's still the same game that encourages exploration and creativity but the whole world just feels a lot more alive magical and full of adventure.\s\sAnd this is a game I bought for €10 almost a decade ago.\s\sI can see how the DLC shops in the other versions can leave a bad aftertaste but how would that ""ruin"" the original game?An overclocked pi? Thats impressivetbh the only time this ""acting"" was acceptable was Yogscasts' The Shadow of Israphel. That series was golden as a kid.Yeah Didn't expect to come across this right after closing MinecraftMet my husband on Minecraft. Just celebrated our first anniversary :DModded Minecraft is the shitDont they have mods where you go to different planets and crap now? From what I saw some of those mods got real crazy real fast.Yes but things will always be better and amazing with mods. I think a game should be judged as the developers made it. So lets give a shout out to Vanilla. Vanilla is good as hell these days.I don't know why I just never liked modded Minecraft. Vanilla will always have a special place in my heart.Just go to top of all in /r/feedthebeast  you'll be amazedYes it is! Been playing modded 1.7.10 ever since it came out now I have amassed 54 mods over the years since then until now. Gameplay is so immersive and there's constant new discoveries I never knew existed. Definitely but vanilla Minecraft is also awesome as it is.Been grinding stoneblock for months now there is SO MUCH FUCKING STUFF TO DO!You'll love this. https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cgI still play it and i’m not afraid to say so! Also pls upvote i need karma to post xdAlso TerrariaYes it is a good gameSometimes things get popular because they are good 🤷‍♂️Many don't wanna see it but it's up to taste 🤷Not a bad game at all  some of my friends ( All 18 - 20 ish ) play together every now and then and it's one of the most fun things to do .Watching minecraft go from hitting infdev to where it is now has been a weird experience. It's a piece of global culture that I'm glad exists it's brought so many good experiences to so many millions of peopleDoesn't this just apply to fortnite as well? I really dislike when people make fun of CHILDREN for liking the game. Why bully anyone for enjoying something? Yep :)I spent a week with friends over New Years in a holiday house. Things went... poorly. The group got a little tense some of us wondered if this was the end of our circle. Then one night I suggested we play Minecraft together because my friend had it on his Xbox. That was the first night since the tensions started that I felt like we were back to normal. Wandering around finding a mountain to build a house on others leaving to build their own base absolutely roasting each other joke roleplaying as a family (honestly do you even have a friendship circle if you haven't roleplayed as either a family or as gods) just generally having a good time. Thank you Minecraft.[deleted]Ive been playing it since this post got loads of upvotes ahahha its greatIdk what Internets you use but mine love Minecraft A lot of people dont like it and say its bad cos of the communityYeah i also like mc now but that gives me a horrible idea. What if we think the same about fortnite laterThere’s nothing horrible if it happens with Fortnite. But what I know what both Minecraft and Fortnite have in common is that both made different generations of kids happy and have fun playing video games. Vanilla Minecraft is the shit. It happened for a similar reason to why everyone staered leaving Facebook. Except instead of a bunch of old people using it it was a bunch of tiny kidsI like Minecraft. Do you like Minecraft?r/wholesomememes let's make a minecraft serverMy dad created my username for Minecraft back in 2012. He passed away in 2014 but I’ve kept it in nearly every account I have for anything including reddit. I think it’s a nice way to remember him.I always have a place in my heart for that game.Its honestly one of the best games of our generation. You never had to pay for things that truly help you it’s on nearly every platform and with modding you can do literally anything you want. Hell theres probably a fucking jojo siwa mod. \s\sWould take minecraft over fortnite any dayI still love it. Still too poor to buy it. *life of a poor teenager*\s_I still love it.

They send you a code and you redeem it in the Microsoft store installed on your pc DambAmenIm in high school and I got back into minecraft 2 years ago and I felt this sort of shame playing it because I knew it was cringy and I would die if anyone found out I was playing it. Fast forward a couple months and I find out almost everyone plays it with no shame in high school. 10/10 gameMinecraft is whatever you want it to be. Whenever my mates and I make a server I inevitably at some point go rogue and try to (Literally) undermine everything they’ve done. The game takes a new dimension with an antagonist.\sExiling myself to the mountains only to create a lair worthy of Dr. Doom from which I conceived “Project Arcturus” (AKA burrow under everyone and plant massive amounts of TNT wired to hidden pressure plates and switches in their own homes) was a drama worthy of Shakespeare.""A game about fucking mining and building houses""I was so bad at it all I would do every single time is go in creative and build a new houseI'm actually disappointed my son stopped playing Minecraft because peer pressure steered him towards Fortnight and Smash Bros. I didn't play it but I liked when he would call me into the playroom to show a new building he'd made that he was proud of. I miss that game.If you have VR try ViveCraft it's phenomenal. Me and my boyfriend really enjoy Minecraft Undertale and Deltarune for what it is.I love Minecraft so much. Discovered in my late 20s after graduate school.Minecraft is fucking awsome[deleted]I have played minecraft from the beginning and im never stopping❤️I wasn't aware people were being made to feel bad about it. That's awful.  It's such a simple game  in all the right ways. Ever since going off to college a minecrraft server has kept me close to 7 of my friends despite us all being at a different university.  If it wasn't for the game we would have all separated so i'm very thankful for Minecraft I still love the game and i play it casually on my phone. I just stay away from the fanbase and boom. FunThose three things are great in a game. Was Minecraft ever really disputed as a ''bad game'' and the players as dummies for playing it? Some people didn't get the low graphics style I believe. But Minecraft has always been huge right from the start. And the people playing it never gave two damns about anyone calling out Minecraft for having such low graphics. \s\sI have never played it. But I enjoy seeing all the amazing things people create in that game. I had a friend that told me he refused to play it because he disliked the graphics and hated building games. Took awhile but eventually he got to the point where he just wanted a game we could play together so he decided to finally pick up Minecraft after I told him about modpacks. He asked which one I was playing so I told him and he gave it a go. It was a bit of a rocky start but he's now hooked on it thinking about it a lot in his day-to-day life.\s\sSo many people judge it by it's looks it's community (or perceived community) online toxicity towards it etc and see it as little more than a child's game but have absolutely no idea just how complex this game can actually be. I recommend everyone give it a fair unbiased chance. If you can't love it with either vanilla or modded then it truly isn't the game for you and that's fair. At least give it a fair chance is what I would ask.\s\sThe first time I played it I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I dug a little hole in a hill figured out how to build tools and a door with help from the web. Got bored quit didn't coming back until someone on Youtube showed me that mods exist which was about a year after I had given up on it. That got me a little interested and what started as a download of a minimap and recipe book evolved into something much much more for me. Since then I have played a significant number of modpacks helped create a modpack for a Youtuber and moderated numerous ones myself. My wife a few friends of mine and I love this game and to think I almost wrote it off just like so many others already did.A Comma would have made a huge difference in that statement. I fucking love Minecraft. It's a great ""I don't have responsibilities so I'm gonna piss the day away"" game.We've started a local server with a few friends last week and we literally can't get enough.Yeah speaking of Minecraft anyone know any good creative servers or just servers in general? Wanna get back into the game but can’t find any good servers Fucking sameYesMet my wife on Minecraft six years ago. Been happily married for four years now still game together! \s\s&#x200B;\s\s[The ring I got her was perfect nine blue diamonds in a square.](https://i.imgur.com/gpVsnBW.jpg)OMG yes! Minecraft is such a great game and no one should feel guilty of playing it. It still gets regular FREE updates and can be played endlessly which is why I love it.Agreed.Minecraft tekkit is the reason I passed GCSE Chemistryredstone is the reason I got a 10 in my first electrical engineering classCommand blocks are the reason why I study programming.PhahhahahahCreepers are the reason I joined ISISEquivalent exchange is the reason I know powers of 2 up to 32768 still one of if not my favorite modWe need to bring it back i played once or twice last month. The new update is sick.I don’t give a crap what anyone thinks. Minecraft is a great game for when I’m feeling down. I can just zone out build some cool shit and enjoy the music. \s\sAnd nothing beats that feeling of finding diamond. I guess I'm just old enough to have skipped over this phenomenon - it was news to me that anyone made fun of Minecraft at all beyond some edgy middle- or high-schoolers. Why would anyone hate such a positive well-liked thing? Since no punctuation is used I have to infer it for myself. Read: ""a game about fucking mining and building houses."" I’ve recently started playing again with my little brother. Game is still good lol.I will always love minecraft I'm just happy it isn't the goto cringe meme anymore thank you fortniteMan I was so little I was afraid to go in mines cus of zombies and I would switch to peacefulI used to play Minecraft like crazy using a bunch of mods and texture packs really had a lot of fun. I played regular Minecraft a bunch recently with my friend and his 7 year old all of us on voice chat. I showed him how to shear a sheep and he laughed and screamed ""The sheep is NAKED!"" pretty sure it's my most favorite moment.ITT: People defending Fortnite on a post that never mentions FortniteLiterally its so annoyingI've honestly seen more posts complaining about people hating on minecraft in the last three months than I've seen people actually hating on minecraft in the last 10 years. \s\sIt's like virtual LegoExactlyEven better the stuff you can do with command blocks and Redstone is insane. I remember when someone built a working calculator in Minecraft and everyone was like ""Wow that's insane.""\s\sIt's gotten even more insane since they added command blocks. Someone recreated Pokémon Red/Blue in Minecraft. Like the entire game you can emulate it within Vanilla Minecraft.By the way that LEGO worlds game is a pretty good voxel game if your kids (or you) love legos too.  Which everyone loved as a kid*childhood memories on replay*Don't touch my e-legos! Fucking raiders.I met all three of my current best friends and a lot of cool peeps on a minecraft server (that unfortunately was closed last year if I remember correctly) we still occasionally play together and it's awesome. I remember though when I was 13 I was ashamed that I played minecraft so literally no one knew. People at my school were making fun of that game a lot.Its sad that people dont let others just enjoy what they want to enjoyYeah I watched videos of a particular person playing it very often. I was made fun of. I got peer pressured into only watching at home.Minecraft is mad good I play it on my ps4 as a ""I don't know what I want to play"" game and then 3 hours pass and I built a farm a house on the side of a mountain and a pier by the lake.\s\sI really want Minecraft on the Switch so I can do all of that shit but on the go but I'm broke so it'll have to wait.How the fuck is this wholesome  I posted a meme where Ben Shapiro told an insecure girl that she’s cute and the facts didn’t  care about her feeling then the mod bot had the audacity to tell me that it wasn’t wholesome.I just recently started playing it again. Glad I did.I'm actually holding back tears this post really got meHow is this wholesome? He will never forgivePeople just dislike it because they're contrarians that probably bought the game in alpha.:'-) the feels. I used to play on one of those whitelisted servers that had a whole application system to join in. Everyone was so supportive skilled and helpful. It lasted a few years until most people were too busy to play and it wasn't worth hosting anymore. The server owner was also on a very good path towards being able to make youtube videos (not the ""hey kids!"" type but just calm wholesome let's plays) for a living as the minecraft craze was taking hold and he got noticed by big guys. He chose studying over that which I fully respect. I just miss the whole thing we had going there. So sappyY'know Fortnite is a good game too in 6 years we will see the same exact meme but with Fortnite. You guys just hate it because popularI've always said Minecraft is this generation's Lego.\s\sLet them build and be creative.I started playing with mc on a work computer in my late 20s when it was a browser game on pc. My buddy and I both bought it when it came out on Xbox and built so much stupid shit. And now I play it with my 5 yo occasionally.  I will always wear my creeper shirt without any shame.  When did all the minecraft hate pop up? Did I miss something?When a game gets popular kids naturally follow in the footsteps and play it too and kids will do cringy things with it therefore making people hate said popular gameThat's one of the biggest downsides of the gaming community so many gamers are entitled brats I could personally never get with the game but I thought the world building was incredible. I’m just jealous I don’t have that kind of creativity. I admire and respect it in others though.I didn't know making fun of people who play mincraft was a thing until I was talking to my sister and she stopped me mid-sentence to say ""you play minecraft?"" By the end of the conversation about minecraft she actually felt dumb because she had never even played it and has no idea what it even is. She just knows its not cool for adults to play it. Honestly I'm a grown woman so if I want to play rainbow unicorn in my spare time who cares? My little brother always wants me to play Minecraft with him . He’s really little so a lot of games he usually doesn’t do that well on and he’s still learning how to read so some games he still doesn’t understand. But I make sure to at least play Minecraft with him because it’s easy enough for him to understand and allows him to be creative. Plus we both have fun and it allows us to play together. It’s a perfectly fine game in my book.[deleted]Never played Minecraft. I didn't even know this game existed until the Internet started hating it to the point that everyone started to know what it is. Honestly its just super good i still play it single player till this day i can't get enough of it.\s\sPeople spamming it on youtube for kids is what ruined it just like fortniteYeah man. Its so nostalgic to hop into a single player world and relax. Its genuinely just relaxing to playI've just been playing the latest snapshot too and it's *still* fresh and interesting The shit they're adding in 1.14 really hits the spot. Maybe it'll never be revolutionary again but they keep it moving nicely.I play Minecraft solo and all I do is mine for diamond. I love my mines. I rarely play video games so I don't want a game with a story. Minecraft is perfect for me. That's it. Most people taking the piss out of ot were taking the piss out of it's YT scene and not the game itself. Problem is I feel most younger people have a harder time distinguishing ironic mocking from real mocking. Everyone I know loved/loves minecraft. Only reason some people stopped playing was because their accounts got hacked by Russians(no joke lol).Neither of them are ruined hahaha. Just play them. Play what you enjoy for fuck's sake. Some people will think you're a big loser nerd for playing anything at all so just have funPlayed Fortnite BR before it got popular before they had an in game store or anything. It's a solid game under the hood and is a ton of fun to play with friends. I don't play it all that much but I don't look down on anyone that does because that would be dumb.I can smell the scent of truth Played Minecraft before it became uncool. Had a bunch of 20 something's all on a server building cities and shit. Then it became a thing for kids and everyone I knew quit.True. honestly Fortnite is a very well made game with good and creative take on the BR gamemode but just like you said the YouTube spam and the community were the ones that ruined it. They didn't ruin anything. If anyone is shaming you for something you're doing that 1) isn't hurting anyone else or 2) isn't hurting you then you're letting them get you to ruin it for yourself. I play Minecraft. I don't give a fuck if a bunch of ten year olds do the same.\s\sBut fuck Fornite and it's absolute garbage shooting mechanics that is more RNG than skill at times.How does people making videos about a game ruin that game?I used to love it but it got ruined for me because of people saying its a kids game. Actually when I was younger I actually enjoyed those videos. Although it may affect the community negatively. I and many other kids at the time were happy because of it.I had no idea there was anything against it but I'm old I guess. Is it considered a kids game now? And if so who cares ya know? I just set up a server for my siblings and cousins to play on and I am 27 years old. Still having fun with it! We are building a medieval village together.I play it everyday to relax. The soundtrack is the single most calming experience I’ve ever had.On my personal Twitter I make an effort to praise things I do like instead of hating on what I don't.\s\sWhen I find a video game I don't like I turn it off and insert one I do. Usually Fallout.Eh. Idk. I played it in 2018 despite what everyone said and gave it a fair chance and I found it really boring that it got stale for me after a few days even with mods I guess Terraria spoiled me lmao.Go on servers where they make different games with coding This this is the post that reallly made me happy with myself. I remember that I had to quit minecraft back then because everyone at my class was calling it lame and irrelevant. I didn't wanna be thought differently than I already am by everyone there back then.Seriously it’s a good game.Hytale looks pretty cool.It's the best. Though it kinda feels empty without friends. Any bedrock loners here willing to play vanilla survival?One of the only games where developers weren't trying to grab all our money 😊I bought this game for $20 on Xbox a few years ago. Still playing it! It’s just incredibly relaxing to play it while listening to a podcast or documentary. But yeah I do feel a little embarrassed for enjoying a “kids” game. I actually told my daughter the other day that I’m going to introduce her to the game.  Not for MP not for youtube just for the fun that the game is.32 here and just started playing it again and they have added so much content. Now I end up just exploring for hours and never building a base. I really need to find an adult server to play on but Im to lazy to deal with the forums.True as fuckI have unironically played probably around 36 hours in the last 2 weeksI still play often sometimes I take breaks but I always wind up going back.You can never pass a year without checking minecraft again.Hell yeah manI started casually playing w friends in class a few weeks back we can't stop thinking abt it nowMinecraft is like virtual LEGO without the risk of stepping on a random piece.. who doesn’t like LEGO?I remember there was a video that surfaced a while ago of some kid with autism at Minecon asking Notch a question about autism and relating to the game or something and it ended up in like 20 different cringe compilations the comments were full of so many people just viciously bullying him saying ""lmao he should kill himself"" or making fun of his disability. This is why I've always hated cringe culture it's just mindlessly bullying people for liking stuff because you don't like it like why do you care so much? These people aren't hurting anyone this shit is like High School but on the internet.How did the internet make anyone feel bad for playing Minecraft?Same with Fortnite dude.Same with fortnight and funny thing is Minecraft and Fortnight are both mega popular colorful cartoony game. \sI guess cringe culture is too serious and too mature to enjoy such childish gamesNot for me but I can respect how people can enjoy it and to heck with anyone making someone feel bad for playing itI love me some drunk minecraftSince when do people hate in mine craft?I don't know of anyone knocking one of the most popular games on the planet other than people that knock stuff just to knock stuff.\s\sknockers if you will.I agree! I still play Minecraft despite being well over my 12 year old Minecraft obsession phaseI like it. The music is relaxing and you can pretty much do whatever you want in the world.\s\sIt has a habit of jump scaring me though. I'll be mining and suddenly from the darkness:\s\s*tsssssss*\s\sOr..\s\s***Thwack***\s\sOr I turn around and there are a pair of eyes staring at me while holding a random piece of coarse dirt.Don’t shame someone for playing a game everyone else has played atleast once in their lifeI discovered Minecraft in January 2012 a few days after I had my son in December 2011 and it got my through my postpartum depression. The darkest depression I’ve ever been through. The PPD was so incredibly horrible I had suicidal thoughts...I started out watching Let’s Plays (Tobuscus) and loved the idea of the game. Then I eventually bought it after having to torrent it for a time and have been playing since. I still go in just to strip mine and explore on Peaceful mode while listening to music as a way to relax from the day. \s\sMy son is now 7 and he has his own account and we play together. He learned what sheep pigs cows horses and chickens are because of the game. Minecraft will always have a special place in my heart. Always. It helped save my life.\s\sI now have a second son who will be two in May. It took five years for me to have the courage to have a second child for fear I would go through that depression again and fear that maybe I wouldn’t make it through this time but I’m happy to say that depression never showed up. \s\sThank you Minecraft. Thank you Mojang. Thank you Notch.About a year ago somebody stole my account and i never received anything about an email/password change. It had my minecon cape on it. Just give it back :(Aw thats shitty dude:( can't you contact mojang or Microsoft about it? [deleted]No deal bro your account is lit.Thanks OP now I want to play Minecraft but I'm nowhere near my computer :(That’s what people are doing to Fortnite fans. I mean i’m no fan but let people play what they like. They’re not hurting anybody or themselves.People want to be a part of the ""hating Minecraft"" circlejerk so they can appear ""cool."" Pfft...I still playHeck yeah gamerHonestly Minecraft is the best game to fallback to. Tired of your other games? Minecraft. I used to love this game I would always try to make new mini games and hunger game maps.  \s\sIt was very time consuming so I stopped and moved on to other games.  I still love minecraft. To this day whenever I have a bad day I like to just make a world on peaceful mode and just build a cute little house and farm :)tbh compared to Fortnite Minecraft is really really goodWhile we're here same goes for Fortnite.\s\sI'd be over the moon if fucking everyone in my generation played 1 game and I could bond with almost anyone about it while growing up.I havent played minecraft in years but it was fun as shit. I personally simply lost interest but I remember at one point thinking of quitting bc I was an adult playing a “kids game”. Still playing sometimes during college. Nothing better than relaxing with the game a 9:00 at night after a long day.The influx of people that hate on the game you love these days are way too much. Man if you love something don’t let those dumdums shit on your parade! Your fun and happiness over their toxicity! The hate on Fortnite really bugs me.  I personally don't play anymore because my old ass just can't compete and I get frustrated.  The other day I saw a comment with a ton of upvotes that said ""Fortnite is ruining gaming"".  How in the hell is it ruining gaming?  If you don't like it don't play it.  Simple.  It's always the same stupid arguments about microtransactions and kids dancing and youtube.  It's a free game and the MTs are just cosmetic.  Don't buy em.  Kids having fun? Oh no!  Kids ""spamming"" youtube with fortnite vids.  Don't watch em.  It was exactly the same with Minecraft a few years ago.  So many gamers hating because they played it back in the Beta days when it was ""cool"".  Now a bunch of kids heard about it so therefore it sucks.Hell yeah man!!!Honestly minecraft is what’s keeping my friends and I together through college.Minecraft made me meet friends i still have nowI still play a lot of minecraft. Recently I did a solo hardcore world and killed the dragon then almost killed the wither but I died because it kept ramming me. Hardcore mode is such a fun way to play to me.Here's an interesting take on hardcore I'm doing.\s\sInstead of setting it to hardcore enable cheats and type this command after respawning.\s\s/spread players 0 0 0 100000 @p\s\sIt'll teleport you to a random spot in the world in a 100000 block diameter. Of course you can lower the number if you think that's too large of an area.\s\sI'm doing this and it'll be so exciting if I find a build of mine from a previous life. I highly recommend disabling coordinates though because that can ruin the magic.Lmao nice oneDamn my friends and I used to grind the fuck out of Minecraft. I actually ended up getting pretty damn good at the game and became an admin of some big server. I miss that game lol. May have to re download it now. Best concept of a game honestlyI used to be one who thought it was childlike until I met my bf that got me to try it with him! I actually ended up loving it and loved catching a bunch of dogs and designing a place! I actually get super creeped out by caves and endermen lol.People on the street can see my pc screen through my window. Every time I think of playing the game  I'm scared that people see and think less of me.  \sI don't have it with any other game idk why.It sucks!!\sJust play it man!!\sWho cares what some randoms thinkHello!

\s[deleted]Not sure why you're down voted but. Minecraft Comes Alive let's you interact with villagers and makes them unique. Still kinda dumb though. I used to know everything in 1.2.5 \sIt's been a while.Got back into minecraft recently and it still is an amazing game! Especially with shaders which make the game look as beautiful as the newest AAA games. The current version made some big changes to internal mechanics so it's taking modest a while to get their stuff updated but once that's out everything gets even better! A really nice community too.In like 4 th grade I was cool because its *so rare* for girls to play video games. But then Minecraft started becoming uncool so I stopped playing and watching CaptainSparkelz. Worst decision ever lol. That game is goldNow hold on i knew about the mining and the building houses parts but there is fucking too in this game?\s\sMight have to give it another look.I'm out of the loop.  Who says bad stuff about minecraft?People feel bad for playing mine craft? :(I can smell the weed from here They *drove* me hereThere was an interview where Seth mentions his dad wears button ups and basketball shorts and now I’m super curious what he wore to the Ellen show.Parent life goals!!!

\sI love his Mums Instagram. She takes photos of his movie posters and tags him in them. It’s just so sweet.\s\sLink???And now that I've spent about 20 minutes trying to find her account on my own . . . . What's her instaname?Seth Rogan is an awesome person. Just saw him and Evan Goldberg in Vancouver for the Just For Laughs festival going on. \s\sNot only did they provide an evening of hilarity he stayed onstage and shook hands/took pictures/handed out Tim-Bits (donut holes) for well over a half an hour after the show ended at midnight. \s\sWhen we got the tickets we didn't realize it was a q&a. They both had a great response to the question: when was the last time you shit yourselves? Spoiler: both stories included walking and hiding the fact they shit themselves.\s\sThey said it was one of the best questions of the night.Lmao Seth baked on stage handing out Timbits to passing fans sounds like one hell of a time. He looks like a perfect 50/50 of his parents.Aww look how proud they are. I saw them on a late night talk show segment something about ""which celeb's parents are these"" and I didn't guess it at the time but it's undeniable now 😂 they seem super sweetJesus Christ they look like the nicest fucking people on the planetI wish I could have a relationship with my parents I wonder who he geta his laugh from. I bet they are so proud of himTIL Seth's mom is Professor TrelawneyI love Seth Rogan 😍His dad looks like he appreciates even his raunchiest movies.Ellen broke bread with babykiller Bush.Your gonna be downvoted to hell delete while you canHis dad looks like he has the same laugh. How does Seth Rogan look identical to both his parents at the same time wtf. My parents rule\s\s*HEH.*I wish I had parents like that but it's no problem I don't because I am definitely a Mom like that! They were hippies for sure.. cool parentsI bet they laugh just like himWholesomeness detectedI bet you his dad laughs the same way he does. Look at that happy face.Another reason why Seth Rogan is the coolest...This made my cold heart warm up. That’s one way to guarantee not having to fight to find a parking spot Seth’s dad is Rob Reiner??He always seems slightly confused about his fame.  I know what you mean. But imagine being super high only everyone you see knows who you are expects you to always be funny and wants to take a selfie with you. I’d probably look slightly confused too.Dude probably walked into the wrong interview & kept rolling with it.Maybe he still lives in their basement and asks them for rides?Because he's an ""everyman"". He is the epitome of a dude you know at work.Madam trelawny is Seth's mom? r/entitledparents has left the chatWholesome asfThey look so proud. His mom looks like a hippieIs the mom the woman who played the “Profit” person in Harry Potter?Seth Rogan is so unfunny.  He never said a funny thing. It’s all just spectating on thingsI’d like to hear their laugh I use to think Seth was just a raunchy comedian just in it for the money(not in a bad way or anything)  but I started paying attention and the amount of amazing projects he’s had his hands on is impressive and he’s really a excellent producer/writer/director/actor. Then I saw his Hilarity for Charity and the work he and his wife have done for families of Alzheimer’s patients is absolutely inspiring. They do amazing work.  I’ve seen first hand how hard it can be having a family member with Alzheimer’s. Hats off to them. The movie where Seth is Adam Sandler's assistant  made me look into both of their backstories and charity work. Actors and actresses are severely overlook when it comes to charity work i feelOMG it's future Lee SyattHis dad is the guy in Pineapple Express that throws the bat and hits Jonah Hill right? While they escape through a backyard?[deleted][deleted]But you’re their favorite-one. Why does his dad look like Jonah Hill in costume?Actually Jonah Hill is his dad in costumeBecause he isAnd his mom looks like Fred Armison in costumeSandy Rogen has a very funny TwitterI didn't know professor trelawney had a daughter.All the way from Vancouver?Wow! Parents doing Parent things but it’s wholesome because he is famous I really don’t find him funny in most his movies but I like listening to him talk as himself in about anything and ever story about him is always nice.They look exactly like I'd imagine Seth Rogans parents would lookDid he also use his fake forced laugh?Even his parents look highFuckin goals dudeKing of the moms basement gangI wonder who he geta his laugh from. And they appear exactly as I expected them to.they look EXACTLY what id expect one of the most prolific stoners parents to look likeStill rocking that wardrobe they haven’t updated since 1975I’m jealous of the probable fact that they all smoke together.Same.

Hopefully they all get to keep that tradition up for a while. \s\sDo they just go with him to Ellen I'm assuming they live close if they drove him? Or do they have any other fun shows like seeing with him? How cool would that be to be like hey mom and dad I'm going on such and such shows next week wanna come along? That would be tight to be able to do. If I'd had ever gotten really famous I'd have taken my Mom to all those type things if she wanted but well she is gone now so it it's too late for that. Besides my acting career kind of fell out there for a while beforehand anyway and the whole castle getting trapped in the sun in '99 thing didn't help either and what really didn't help was that when my kind did come back to the spotlight everyone wanted the pretty ones the kind that sparkle. It's cool though I'm not really cut out for the spotlight if I'm being honest I still prefer the shadows and one of these days the castle will be back up and causing chaos across the land so none of this will end up mattering anyway.

\sThanks for the post brightened my day.Richard!Today you tomorrow me. :’)That is an awesome story. Thank you for sharing.\s\sThe proverb quoted ('good fences make good neighbors' (or in this case 'good neighbors make good fences')) is questioned in ""The Mending Wall"" by the often misunderstood Robert Frost. \s\sNone of which has anything to do with your heartwarming story but if you want some Americana exploration of boundaries and relationships Bobby Frosty has your back. Something there is that doesn't love a wallI’d say it’s a pretty brilliant use of the Frost line. Both because of the double meaning and because this story has a lesson that’s similar to the theme of “The Mending Wall”: that you shouldn’t mistrust others simply because you don’t know them or because they are different from you. Just listened to [an episode of Gladwell's ""Revisionist History"" podcast](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/25-general-chapman's-last-stand) related to this.[deleted]It’s actually a Robert frost quote lolHey I’m from Romania and this is true we rebuilt our fence between our neighbors too and didn’t ask for anything.\sAlthough Romania is a corrupt country I’m from there so I like itA country being corrupt doesn't mean its citizens are.\s\sThis is something that I have to remind myself of more and more recently.

That's how it is in the UK anyway.NiceYeah they build fences very cool but we out here building walls 😎Great neighbors make fences!This reminds me of a similar story where I lived next to some Hispanic neighbors who were always staying up late being loud and drunk on the patio. They would leave beer cans and bottles on the cinderblock fence that would blow into my yard. Sometimes I called the cops for noise.\s\sThen my wife passed away and I guess they noticed I hadn’t left the house in a long time because my car stayed in the driveway. A couple days go by and the oldest son came and knocked on my door to drop off an enchilada casserole with a note saying his mother had read the paper and noticed I hadn’t left the house. It was a much needed act of kindness in a dark time for me.\s\sA week goes by and I’m still locked in the house watching The Office (thank god for the office). Then I hear a bunch of talking and things banging around outside. This wasn’t uncommon and it usually would stop after an hour or so. I waited and just stayed on the couch watching the office. Eventually I got agitated so I called the cops again. By now the warmth of the gesture with the food had warn off. The cops come because I see the lights and the noise stops so I can finally get to sleep.\s\sThen the next morning I finally had to go back to work since I had taken almost a month off and I had bills to pay. So I popped a couple Xanax and got my shit together enough to go outside to my car.\s\sImagine my surprise when I get out there and my neighbors have hung up a piñata in my car port! I thought surely this can’t be full of candy. But I look down to my right and sure enough there is a paper wrapped bat. So I pick it up and tentatively roll it in my hands. Feeling the paper crunch beneath my fingers. In a flash I begin mercilessly beating the piñata. First in the air then in pieces on the ground. The candy and paper stuffing is strewn everywhere. As tears roll down my face I look up slowly to see my neighbors family watching me. They smile and with a simple approving nod began to clap. It was in that moment I knew I had misjudged them. As it turns out immigrants are regular people. Then I came here to get points on the internet.\s\sDo you live on Benchwood ?

Got me a ps3 with two controllers and 5 games for $30Thanks dadThanks Terry [Pratchett](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6667266-the-lodgings-were-on-the-top-floor-next-to-the) the key to being a successful criminal in suburbia is making sure your neighbors like you[removed]That’s why I live near successful Olympian swordsman. Good fencers make good neighbors So you also have Romanian neighbors? Probably tired of seeing her work naked in the garden.Honestly I’ll take a ton of arminians. I know a bunch and they are kind hard working family oriented law abiding and they appreciate American values.\s\sNot every foreigner is like that.I think people often misunderstand the aphorism ""good fences make good neighbors."" Its not a blanket endorsement of building walls between yourself and everybody.\s\sA fence is not a serious obstacle. All it really is is a demarcation of boundaries with some privacy and a good fence is a maintained fence one that is kept up to spec accurate and aesthetic (because again its not like its a serious obstacle).\s\sYou shouldn't go through life ever fearing boundaries or letting people past your own. But you shouldn't go completely ignoring the rules of conduct and respecting what others may consider beyond the pale. The first step to getting to know and appreciate anyone is knowing where you and them stand and what they value and what you value. Your boundaries their boundaries. \s\sRefusing to put up any boundaries or leaving them vague in the real world leads to assumptions. Assumptions lead to misunderstanding and misunderstanding is miscommunication and that leads to needless conflict.\s\sSo good fences make good neighbors. \s\sForeigners building fences? I can see Trumps ears pricking up.Bloody Beaker folk. The Beaker folk.

Open the flood gates.Dude there are two kinds of Romanian people: fucking assholes and awesome people. There's no in betweenI am romanian and you don't realise how true this isIts funny you said that I have 2 Romanian neighbors one is the nicest guy I've ever met for example I've seen him do this twice if he sees you bringing in groceries or something he will run down stairs and hold the door for you and help you carry them in the other one is so evil she gives me chills when I walk by herAnd vampires don’t forget vampires One of my best friends is Romanian. She's always there for me and is the kind of person that holds your hair when you're puking over a toilet bowl.\s\sHer mom is even nicer. She treated me as her own child when I was at their place in highschool. \s\sI love them both to death.I had a Romanian foreign exchange student stay with us for six month and when we visited her home I was amazed on how handy her dad was. Like a redneck with engineering skills. [deleted]Sounds like Eastern Europe in general to meI grew up with Romanians in south Florida. This comment is true. Also I don’t think I’ve ever met an ugly Romanian girl.Very accurate. Couldn’t have said it better myself. There are some Romanians who are complete pricks and then there others who are very kind people.That's so fucking true as a Romanian myselfI had a Romanian friend all through high school she was awesome.Yes on the one hand i have a good Romanian friend on the other the guy i get into fights with the most is one of the Romanian assholes.I think you just described humanity as a wholeMy grandmother is neither wat do? Plz helpI haven't met many Romanians but the ones I've had have all been in the later category.Yes. I’m glad some of us awesome people are finally getting some credit.

Sounds pretty xenophobic to me. \s\sSince she said her neighbors were good she should now feel safe to tear down the fence and unlock her doors at night.She's named like my name! If they bang so hard the fence falls down I feel sorry for the Mrs.As a Romanian raised in North America from the young age of four and avoiding other Romanians because of their passionate tone and aggressiveness this makes me smile.

We are capable of kindness I assure you lolI assume these awesome neighbours have their citizenship and pay taxes to live in a beautiful community beside someone fortunate enough to have a fence. \s\sIt’s amazing how awesome all humans are when we all help each other ☺️. I wish there was a sponsorship program where citizens could sponsor individuals immigrating into the US Canada etc. I think it would be a great way to actually reach out and help those in need. It would also help fast track new comers in learning the culture of their new home.\s\sWith immigration being such a hot topic I think ideas like this would really help show who “talks the talk” and who “walks the walk” in terms of helping others in need.\s\sCheers to that fence and pay it forward!This post is an example of a cool lighthearted joke however unfortunately the comments are not so we're gonna have to lock it.\s\sto everyone who is being nice! have a nice week!Supports my long held belief that you represent your home country wherever you goYou were bringing their property value down and they didn't want to hurt your feelings.Something there is that doesn’t love a wall...[removed][removed][removed]If they did it because they were ""sick of her broken fence"" then they more than likely would have accepted money or boose.

By the time I have lunch I'm pretty much just waiting to go to work. But if I got up and awake right away I could get so much more done. I'm trying to get a little more done each day but still allow a little flopping around.I too am proud of my onion.Hope I can feel that way eventuallyI don’t wanna brag but this is me :) I’ve come a long way this year and it feels soooo good.

Props to anyone overcoming their mental health issues you’re all the real MVP’s[deleted]I started seeing a therapist recently and she has helped me learn mindfulness. Basically when I replay those bad stories in my head the ones where I beat myself up to acknowledge them and move past them. We're doing breathing exercises with affirmations for now. Still learning so that's all I've got. But it is a start.\s\sLook for a breathing exercise or meditation app to help guide you. Consider looking for a therapist as well if you need some help. There is no shame in it!Exercise regularly. Physical health is surprisingly important in keeping good mental health. Going to the gym running biking on a regular basis has helped me since I started doing this stuff at the start of summer along with dropping soda. I have more energy self-confidence and I'm not sleeping 11-12 hours a day over the summer. As the other pets said though therapy can also help. It may depend on the stem of your issues which will help moreBest piece of advice I ever got was from a drug rehab clinic where they taught the CBT/""TTEB"" method and they gave studies and statistics to back it up as having the highest likelihood of success.\s\sTTEB - a trigger in your life that you cannot change or avoid leads to you thinking a thought.  Depending on what that thought is it can lead to a bad emotion in your head that hangs around.  Those bad emotions lead to bad behaviours that we want to change whether it's doing drugs or sitting around the house all day.  The key is to identify the trigger when it happens and tell yourself to change the thought to a more positive one.  Internally like a little cheerleader in your head going ""no fuck that don't think those thoughts here try these thoughts instead"".\s\sWhether that's a stressful event like a breakup and then choosing to say in your head ""it wasn't meant to be we weren't compatible but I am valuable and I deserve love"".  Or whether it's one of those days where you feel lazy and worthless and choosing to change that thought into ""no I have great potential and I might not have achieved it yet but I know that some day I'm not going to be like this who I am right now isn't what matters only what my goal is"".  \s\sIt sounds really stupid at first but you do that for a couple weeks and it starts to become an automatic routine in your head you remember every time you feel shitty ""oh wait I'm supposed to change my thoughts right now"".  And at first those thoughts are just like mantras like internally shouting over bad thoughts.  But after a while it stops feeling like a prayer and you start actually believing the words and thinking them because those *are* your real thoughts.  After a few months you're likely to find yourself feeling better and doing better.Every time you feel that awful feeling like reliving your anxieties ruminating on some old shit remember how it hasn't gotten you *anywhere.* It hasn't given you any new insight or information to work off of to improve your life. For me it goes like ""oh shit heres this thought/memory again.. fuck. ok. I know where it will lead me and I also know that it won't help me. Ok right I am done with this."" and stop thinking. \s\sI find 'grounding' myself to be helpful. Which is just being in the moment looking around at my surroundings listening feeling and literally naming things that are happening for real right now. Like my AC is on. Car engine is revving up. Cricket chirping alone. Ah Yes. Everything is actually fine. It was fine years ago when I felt like this everything was fine every time after I was done feeling like this and everything will be okay really soon.See a professional.Live in the present and don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future. \s\sLearn how to compartmentalize intrusive thoughts\s\sSmoke or eat some weed and chill out.\s\sBe more physically active: closer to athlete than potato.\s\sAnd lastly eat a wholesome diet—not too much—that facilitates a balanced microbiome in your GI tract. The chemicals those bacteria release have a strong impact on psychological well-being.If your mental health is kinda down the self care tips already posted will help and therapy is great.\s\sIf you have full blown mental illness or serious depression you need a psychiatrist and need therapy.It sounds silly and stupid but if you just repeat positive things to yourself you start to believe and feel it. I used to think happy and positive people are just naturally like that but it’s a choice and it takes effort. I only started researching/practicing this stuff about 2 months ago but I’m noticing progress (tracking my daily mood). Anytime I start bashing myself in my thoughts I have to remind myself of what’s important (i.e. hosting a bad meeting at work isn’t the end of the world) and think of my go to thoughts to help myself be happy:\s\s\sNo person place or thing can upset me today. I choose to be positive!\s\s\sOnly good can come to me!\s\s\sI am beautiful intelligent and people like me!\s\s\sDepressed people live in the past anxious people live in the future happy people live in the presentThe main things are therapy psychiatry exercise sleep and diet.

I don’t get it I’m outta the loop.I had to put my studies on hold my relationships everything so I could focus on my mental health and my treatment. It hasn't been easy. I've had a lot more downs than ups I spent three years on medication always thinking about commiting suicide. But today finally I can say I'm free from everything. I no longer have to take medicine my therapist said I'm free to go. I can finally be a normal human being. If you are thinking about ending it all don't do it.

Got into an accident few years ago which threw my life into a different trajectory. Couldn't cope well with new changes and got into really shit habits and self destructive tendencies.

I graduated school started a job i hated that i told myself every week for 7 months would get better and started seeing a therapist weekly because of how awful i felt.\s\sI quit that job went back to school (2 classes away from a new degree) got a job i love and everything going forward feels achievable.\s\sFeels good man.:)Well I'll see about that in a few monthsIf it’s “so important” then how come I’ve managed to exist without it for years?I managed to not have it for 19 years then bam 1 month ago i was diagnosed with GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) probably through drug abuse. Honestly keep what your doing an you’ll be fine. It hits like a truck when it happens and i wish it upon nobody. Dont do drugs and keep fitYa its important.  But sometimes it gets pushed to the back burner.  Work home chores spouse pets money..... sometimes it's too much.  I don't know which to start first its overwhelming and all I want to do is drink immediately after work.  Don't know how to break the cycle..niceThat is amazingGood work guys. I was thinking and hoping this would end up happening.Wow I just finished this documentary and I felt so bad for her! This is heartwarmingLets see PAUL ALLEN'S cardI literally just finished watching this and said to myself ""I hope people raise money for her"".Yes everyone helped one woman who told her story on Netflix. Yeah humans are fuckin great. Glad everyone came together for her :/Saw this coming a mile away lol. Glad it happenedThis is awesome. Watched last night and this is what stuck with me the most. Nice to see a sub-happy ending.Sometimes humans can be good. The worst part to me was viewing this through the eyes of colonialism.  Those folks in the Bahamas were subjugated enslaved and oppressed for centuries. \s\sNow these modern rich kids and celebrities from the US take a giant dump on their island and leave without paying locals for their work.  It sickens me. \s\sI’m so happy that GFM was able to give her the money she deserves.  This makes me so happy!Just a heads up Hulu's version of this documentary is riddled with ""millennial"" points of view. They push that point to the point if it being annoying. They even go as far as getting the creator of the festival for interviews which just seems like you're getting more of his excuses than anything else (meaning they paid him) Netflix's version seems way more straightforward and honest getting everybody else's points of view meaning it shows exactly how they were screwed over and how some had their entire lives and businesses ruined (like this woman here)watch them both. netflix one is partially funded by fuck jerry as damage control and tries to absolve them of guilt. The Hulu one spends a lot more time demonizing both the creators and promoters... with the Netflix one spending more time focusing on Billy and trying to excuse the actions of others involved. Which makes sense considering the Netflix one is produced by the main promotion company involved in the whole fiasco.wait a second. what the hell does ""millennial"" point of view mean? Let me get this straight. Are you trying to equate all people around the age of 30 with con artists of this festival giving excuses for their criminal actives? Or do you just use the buzzword millennial because you heard it used in other implicitly bias news articles that lean in your political direction?\s\sOther than that it sounds like you are right Netflix's doc would be better if that's the case about the interviews.People are generally pretty awesome. But it's hard to sell that when there's assholes that are magnitudes louder and a guaranteed dollar. This seems to be the least know fact around. \s\sPeople are almost all really good and descent. If they weren't life would be awful all the time.\s\s\sIt broke my heart at the end of the documentary when she said she paid people with her life savings to pay them off. for their labor. Not only is that such an amazing thing to do but I respect the fact that she respects worker's rights and paying them for their efforts to such a degree that she would pay them personally. That should never be needed and it's a shit position to be in but I am so endeared to her. I hope in the end of this she finds that joy and appreciation of people instead of what this Festival did to her and her people. And I'm so glad to see she's making out profitable (assuming no major issues with taxes receiving all the money etc) of her good deed. GO LADY! Man yeah was it $50k total in losses and paying back workers who didn't get paid? I can't imagine the fallout of that. Especially how hard it would have hit the rest of the island Yeah that part made me feel really sad and I instantly went looking for a place I could donate to her I’m so glad she was featured on the doco and that everyone was able to rally to help her get back on trackAfter watching the Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix I like yourself was left feeling this lady was an absolute diamond. Imo a role model & I am sooooo glad that she has not only been recognized as such but that her faith in humanity will be restored by the fact enough people cared to extent of raising these funds to show her the love respect & decency she herself has shown to others in taking on a responsibility that she should NEVER have had to regardless of the negative impact on herself. All power to her. If I was a resident of the Bahamas I'd be urging her to run for public office. Someone so willing to accept responsibility in the middle of such a shitstorm is the kind of person I'd want leading my community. Why would they even demand money from her?That’s triple what she lost!Good. She reached into her own pocket to pay her neighbors who were hired to do a job none of them otherwise would've been paid for. She deserves it and it will probably end up going right back into her community.[removed]SAME!Just saw the documentary a few days ago and hoped she got help.\s\sGlad to see it happenedShe took the excess money earned from the campaign and gave it to others who suffered similar issues after Fyre. Just a good lady all around.She was legit the saddest part of that whole documentary I'm so happy that people have done this for her.This makes me so damn happy! After watching the doc I felt so bad for this nice woman who chanced her life savings on a bullshit money scam. \s\sThank the universe for decent human beings who care. 🤘🏼We are overpopulated bored opportunity less this is our future we work to pay debt not for enrichment of the mind or spirit we need a minimum wage to keep all these people from impending our society that’s not socialism it’s protecting good hard working people from the manipulators of the herd and still allow progress or we all die because of someone decides to water our crops with Gatorade. Hopefully my crass statement is met with some humor we are at that stage kids.\s\sShe also wrote that she plans to use the money to help the other victims on the island and keep almost none of it herself!\s\sWhat a sweet woman I'm glad something positive is coming out of this.Not good enough to link the actual news article instead of a screencap to get the website traffic so it can pay it's writers apparently.What an amazing womanGoddamn this woman made me tear up while watching it. I love the internet community sometimes.I think the fact this Billy guy got 6 years is pretty wholesome for society. Her good heart paid off for her in the end.  It really is incredible what happens when you do the right thing.  Her good karma came back around and I’m so happy it did :) Humanity always trends towards progress over time. :) What a legendI don't think you can use the absolute depravity involved in fyre festival to show that there is good in the world - if anything this is proof people are horribler/humansbeingbrosShe has the big good.When I saw he crying on the show I went to see if I could donate to her. Saw she got $160k so good for everyone!This lady is more badass and awesome than I'll ever be. I'm glad she's being helped in such a big way. She deserves it. Meanwhile Trumpers raised over 4 millions for a wall that will never be built...Anyone know if there is a fundraiser out there for the other workers that didn’t get paid?She is sharing the money with other workers in the island. She seems like an extremely kind woman.Great question. I haven’t seen the documentary but can’t imagine everyone was so lucky that they could make their case in it.yeah just send your money directly to BillyI watched the documentary and this lady really touched my heart. She is the kind of person you want to have your back and Billy let her down. I’m happy she’s getting help.That’s fantastic! But how is this a meme? When I watched this scene my first thought was whether there was a fundraiser for this lady. I'm so happy to hear this!Just watched Fyre last night pretty much everyone involved guy screwed over by Billy. Feel awful for the guy who had to ditch his home since the people he hired were threatening him since they weren't paid.I watched the Netflix and hulu one the Hulu one is better I think but both worth the watch. But that guy you're talking about somehow at the end it seemed like he was still excited to talk to Billy like he was still friends with him. Good job humans That's because people are good more than not in 1st world countries.\s\sYou only think everything is constantly bad because we live in a world where the news media doesn't report the news anymore. They run an entertainment industry that pumps poorly sourced opinion garbage 24/7 non-stop.\s\sSomeone got shot? Do we have all the facts? No that doesn't matter just run it any ways!!!!I was Soo glad to see that. Me and my wife watched it the other day and found her story and the workers getting stiffed to be the most upsetting. I googled her immediately after watching and the cnn article about her go fund me was literally just posted we were relieved. For as synical as the world can make you it's just nice to see how many people have a heartIm glad she got her money back i felt bad for her losing $50000 she was heart broken.The pre party looked awsomeThe escrow (the person who started the GoFundMe and is based in Tennessee) needs to put up some credentials for herself or proof (like a video of the caterer thanking everyone on GoFundMe). Suspicious of scam might not even be Billy.\s\sAlso someone in the comments section of the GoFundMe said they started another fundraiser for the workers on the island. Also suspicious of scam.yep. seems like those connected to the festival (marketing firm and organizers) are trying to use the docs as a way to raise money for their debts and claim innocence. seems very shadyWhen she started to get teary-eyed... I almost cried and told my hubby I wanted to hug that woman. I'm glad something was done for her. She seems like a genuinely sweet woman. was literally thinking while I was watching the documentary ""I really want to start a goFundMe for this poor woman"" What the hell is fyre festival and why is everyone talking about it. Here you go.\s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Festival\s\sA party so shitty it has a wikipedia page. I just watched this documentary yesterday and the whole time I thought ""I bet the internet will come through and help her make back her money."" So glad to hear she's getting supportDude that's fucking awesome. I felt so bad for this poor woman after seeing this. Her and all the people on the island who worked should be compensated.Yea that documentary was something. towards the end of the doc there’s that 23 year old franky tribble who’s basically sending out scam emails for billy McFarland he went to my high school and was a super fucking douchebag always acted like he was the shit and always started drama but everyone saw through his bs and no one really liked him. Not surprised he ended up working for such a low life. Jeepers In other words the cost of one Fyre Festival ticket This meme reminded me to watch the stupid netflix doc; I have no clue what this is about other then some stupid music festival that flopped horribly early on. That fyre documentary gave me anxiety just watching it. I can’t imagine the stomach ulcer inducing stress everyone except that main guy had. Also fuck the entitled fucks that pissed in other tents because they didn't want neighbors. They deserve to be pissed on while they're sleeping. Yeah I would have quit. I don’t understand why any of them stuck around. Especially the event planner who went to suck the customs official’s dick. That request alone would have me immediately resign. Sunk Cost Fallacy I imagine. The whole project seemed difficult but manageable in the beginning but by the time it seemed too difficult and wholly unmanageable they've already put months of work into it and were a couple weeks from the festival date. Might as well stick it out at this point.You want even more anxiety? Remember Jerry media? The marketing company that marketed fyre festival. They produced the documentary. \s\s\sThat isn't to say the documentary is a sham. I just wonder what they left out to put themselves in a better light. What’s the difference between the Netflix and Hulu ones or are they the same? If different which one is better?Can you give me the short version of what happened at this festival?\s\sEdit: Thanks for all the responses everyone!I thought the whole thing was pretty amusing when it was in the news but the part of the doc that really made an impression on me was the part where they got everybody plastered before unveiling the campground.\s\sI can't imagine the feeling to be wasted drunk in the dark on a foreign island without my shit in the middle of a free-for-all battle which losing results in soaked bedding or worse the wet ground. It's a miracle nobody died.Thank you! I thought I was the only one. It clouded my head so damn much. As much as I loved watching both the Netflix and Hulu one I just felt so anxious after. Like cluttered as fuck. Idk how any of those people stuck around knowing the disaster it was going to be. Seen a lot of shit on the internet but when that one dude was talking about preparing to suck dick for Fyre Fest I was pretty disgusted. How fucking dare a company ask someone to do that shit for their vanity project no lessWhere can I watch the documentary btw? I need to witness the bullshit for myself.I felt the same way! I’m going to Boston Calling music festival and a couple friends bought tickets to rally with me but after watching I felt like I was deceiving them for some reason. Then I remembered I’m not hosting Boston Calling and it’s all okay....unless it rains For every story like this there's hundreds where it is not a happy ending r/aBoringDystopiar/titlepornAwesome! I watched this last night & said to my husband that there will definitely be a gofundme for her somewhere. Poor lady.But you also can't help but hear that little voice in the back of your head. I mean you watch an entire documentary about people throwing money at a something they saw on the internet ... and then you want to throw money at another thing you saw on the internet. I felt heartbroken for the woman and teared up a little and I love the intentions that people have in doing stuff like this but I couldn't help wondering what's real after something like this.Hell yeah. That lady was awesome and the bit where she started tearing up talking about how nobody came back to help really got me. Good to see some justice come of it.\s\s***P.S. Fuck Billy***That was the worst part of assholery from the whole thing for me— putting aside the obvious fraud and incompetence of Billy the fact that they were just taking over the island short-sightedly exploiting  it for their shitty self-indulgent orgy of wealth and excess and then leaving the islanders to deal with the damage and mess. Even if the festival had been a success he fucked over the place so much and I really feel terrible for the locals. This is such good news but I really hope they can get back to normality.This makes me SO happy too. Legit the best thing to come out of this mess. She deserves this and so much more. It upsets me that one of them ~~(the Netflix one maybe?)~~ used a lot of the Fyre Festival footage. I refuse to watch it knowing he got compensated for a documentary about how he screwed a lot of people over.\s\sEdit: Turns out both films allegedly compensated people associated with the film -- Netflix paid the marketing company (and the marketers also co-produced the film) /Hulu paid the festival organizer. Festival organizer asked Netflix for [$125000 for his interview.](https://qz.com/quartzy/1533746/hulus-fyre-vs-netflixs-fyre-fraud-a-scorecard/)ALSO fuck fuckjerry In a weird way fyre festival has now ended up as a great thing for her because she has over tripled her life savings in less than 2 years thanks to these donations.Am I a joke to you?*o h m r j a r u l e*Fuck these ""Influencers"" as well. Why couldn't they come back and use some of that valuable ""influence"" to raise some money for these people? At least some shout outs for them on their media platforms. It seems like everyone is giving them a free pass because they were paid for their services. Well the more important people the ones that actually work the ones like this lady didn't get paid for their services. I hope the influencers get all fat and ugly until their fucking ""services"" are no longer wanted then they'll have to work like real people like the ones that didn't get paid.Does anyone know if the construction workers got paid?Probably not as much as they were promised I'd guess. I think the Netflix documentary said 250k in outstanding day labor wages and supplies.Plot twist: Billy set up the go fund me and pocketed the $160000Why didn’t she have the fundsShe was told she would be reimbursed for the wages she paid to the people she employed to help with the festival and took $50000 out of her savings to do so. The person running the festival didn't have the money (and is now in jail for fraud) and so she was never reimbursed. Cue a tweet from Ja Rule about how this is all because of him.  wonder if this post will get her sommmore doughhhI didn't feel much for all the rich kids who got duped but my heart broke for this lady! I'm SO glad this happened. Restores my faith in humanity again.I’m so glad to read this/ I just watched the doc today and we very bummed to hear about herGrand takeaway? \s\sThe power of marketing.Seeing how this woman’s life was ruined just because of some pompous American douchebag was the saddest part of that documentary. I’m so glad people are helping her.I’m still concerned this Go Fund Me is a scam Billy McFarland is somehow running from prison.Seriously. The fact that he continued to commit fraud ON CAMERA after he was caught ON CAMERA makes me think off camera he would continue this shit somehow. The financier guy in both docs that ran the Fyre Festival Fraud Twitter account has the GFM page linked in the bio so it seems safe.I highly doubt it's run by Billy.\s\sI will also be highly suspicious of this until I see her accepting the money.I was watching this movie yesterday thinking to myself that people were definitely going to do this.I think ***MOST*** people desperately want to help and do good.  Negative emotions come from believing oneself blocked off from Love Empathy and Support.  What about the other local man :(I feel like he got paid... seeing how he got a phone call from homeboy during his interview lol 😂 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥[deleted]This isn't about youThey should take all the money people pledged to build the wall and divert it to pay all the people owed money on that island.Greed is a helluva motivator. Always remember the [first rule of business.](https://frinkiac.com/img/S07E18/562995.jpg)She's gonna have enough funds to run her own festival! #FryerFestI felt bad for this lady. Invested everything she had into this scam.You know the sad thing is they probably could have pulled it off if they gave themselves time to work on the festival and they would have made a killing. Was thinking as I fell asleep last night “that lady did the right thing why doesn’t she have a go fund me yet.”But its not her damn fault. Poor womanThis girl almost mad me cry watching this:/I’ve never seen a bigger cascade of yes men not saying no to people which led to this snowball turned avalanche of a Shit storm. Human nature is truly mind boggling sometimes Some expensive cheese sandwichesNot a memeGoddamm ninjas and their onionsLike to donation page?!!I think it’s against the rules to post links like that my dudeOOTL what is Fyre?Its a festival that happened in the caribean that was a royal clusterfuck of fuckups and its creator was charged. There’s a netflix documentary about itThat ability to help for such a cause is one of the brightest sides of the internet. oh and its users>Billy told me that I need to suck dick to get our water back from customs\s\s>Employ every living soul of working age on the island and don't pay them in the end\s\sHow could they royally fuck up this much\sHonestly I don't think the documentary is giving us the transparency it seems like it is. Did everyone get duped by Billy? Maybe. Or maybe Billy's the one who did the most and since he's in prison and they're not it's suddenly real easy to say ""Yeah I had no idea what was going on it was just Billy"".when he mentioned the dick sucking i had to pause. my mind was RACING. like HOW DID HE SAY YES????? he said he “took one for the team” WHAT THE FUCK????? i literally walked away from the documentary for a few minutes to collect myself. that’s the CRAZIEST thing i’ve ever seen on a documentary. it’s almost hilarious if you forget that hundreds of people were fucked. but man the way he sat with his legs crossed just casually mentioning it. i literally couldn’t take it. Because they wanted to make money and didn’t give a fuck about the festival.I can NOT believe the guy gargled mouthwash and took a shower and marched off to do the deed. My jaw was DROPPED!Awesome! I was hoping for this!\sI literally just got done watching this documentary and was so sad to hear about what happened to her. It's horrible to think of all the people left with nothing after. I'm glad she did right by her people even though she wasnt the one to cause it. Character shows and moves the right people to rectify shitty situations such as this. Hey JaRule pay meYES! i watched the docu yesterday and was legitimately hoping this would happen.Just watched this movie and it had me messed up 😬That shit pissed me off when I saw what they did to that woman. Nice to know people with compassion worked together to help fix what others fucked up.That’s how a company with morals should be ran. Risk should not be passed down to the employees due to improper dealings at the higher levels. This lady did the right thing by her employees it’s a shame she was taken advantage of and it’s awesome that people felt compelled to help someone who placed others above herself. There are far more good people than ""bad"" people (and I don't think bad people are ""bad"" but rather a combination of immature small minded uneducated or literally brain damaged). It's just that the good people are busy living their normal lives and it's only when the actions of the bad people become truly intolerable that the good people decide to put down what they're doing and help. Good always wins in the long term but sometimes it takes bad people getting their way for too long before those people will act.If you're using personal money to pay staff or other company bills then you're just delaying the inevitable. Unless something drastically changes the company is already going bust so all you've achieved is screwing yourself in addition to everyone else.Correct but in this case the woman got totally fucked over by the festival organizers who ran up giant bills in a tiny island economy and then fled without paying when it became evident that the whole thing was going under. According to interviews in the documentaries they had basically the entire island working on setting up the site. She did the right thing by her employees and paid people what they had been promised for their work. It wasn’t about irresponsible business practices causing her to go into personal debt. Somebody make sure billy didn’t make this as a scam fundraiser to continually defile those poor people based on peoples good faith Would'nt put it past him.If Frank starts calling for donations HANG UP. She has spoken to CBS News to confirm it's really her and I think the documentary producers gave their approval to the GoFundMe to add credibility Isn’t this a news story not a meme?Aw this makes me so happy. My heart hurt for her while watching the documentary. I choked up at the end. At first my wife and I chuckled at the part when all the people showed up and she was like “wait. What? What am I supposed to do?”  Out of all the people in the island they went to her place. \s\sThen at the end you can sense her pain. She was crushed. We teared up. So glad she’s getting help. fire festival seriously seems like a government social experiment lmaoMy heart ached to hear her story on the Netflix documentary. It makes me really happy to see how many people donated to this and how much they got back to her. \sFuck that billy guy This isn't wholesome. This is tragicWhat really got me was how she said that SHE is a Bahamian her staff and the people who worked there are Bahamian! She couldnt just fly in a plane away from the mess they LIVE there. She couldnt just not pay these people her friends neighbors employees so she had to use her money. It just really hit it home for me how yeah the festival coordinators got fucked too but they got to leave and worry about it from afar. The workers had to live in and through  the aftermath.exactly. she could have said no and not paid anyone and kept the savings. but thats not the kind of person she is. I was so mad after watching what they did to her.  I'm so glad that wholesomeness won in the end :-)Good she deserved to get paid back. The real victims of the festival were the workers that never got paidPlease be real...   She deserves every penny.  Glad to see it was more than she spent as she didn’t get paid at all.  Ok now lets do Flint! What’s fyre This isn’t wholesome. It’s horrifying that she was even put in this position at all.Hello!

\sI hope she shared it with the Bahamian laborers  r/aboringdystopia Anyone know other docs like this? This was all very fascinating as well as aggravating considering the people got fucked over by one manipulative douche.The only human being in that documentary.Ja Rule better have contributed to this. They shouldn't have to.  Every single one of those models and ""influencers"" should have to give back the absurd sums they got paid for single tweets for a fund benefitting the victims of this scam.\s\sWe need a clawback provision with extra sharp claws.Right?! They're not out hundreds of hours in labor nor putting their livelihoods on the line. That 250k for some fat toad to tweet about Fyre could cover almost everyone's losses. YESS! I was tearing up hearing her story and I was wondering if anyone had started a fundraiser or anything. This made my weekHow is it wholesome that a caterer had to use their life savings to pay other employees? Why the fuck aren't the fuckers (don't know their name and don't care to know) who created the scam forced to pay all of the people they hired what the fuck is wrong with this world oh yeah~~~~~whispers CapitalismThis was the first thing we thought about after watching it we then searched it and were glad to see a number of different parties have raised money for the workers in different ways it ended up being an ironically lucrative deal for them. It’s great because everyone who promoted it was involved had anything to do with it...couldnt give a shit about her. It’s really sad some celebrities got paid 100k to promote it don’t even give a shit about people like this. Eat the fucking rich \s\sEdit: could = couldn’t Kendall made what $250k for just posting an insta. You'd think she'd donate that especially since it's not like she actually worked for it like these people did[removed]You said they could give a shit meaning they did care I’m under the impression they didn’t. You meant couldn’t give a shit right? Unless I’m missing something?\sIt’s fantastic this money has been raised. But it shouldn’t have happened in the first place. I t’s still not right the way they handled these people.\sI was watching it thinking ‘THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE THEY’RE MESSING WITH!’\sIt means jack that Ja Rule did a little apology to this lady on Instagram.

\sI love his Mums Instagram. She takes photos of his movie posters and tags him in them. It’s just so sweet.\s\sLink???And now that I've spent about 20 minutes trying to find her account on my own . . . . What's her instaname?Seth Rogan is an awesome person. Just saw him and Evan Goldberg in Vancouver for the Just For Laughs festival going on. \s\sNot only did they provide an evening of hilarity he stayed onstage and shook hands/took pictures/handed out Tim-Bits (donut holes) for well over a half an hour after the show ended at midnight. \s\sWhen we got the tickets we didn't realize it was a q&a. They both had a great response to the question: when was the last time you shit yourselves? Spoiler: both stories included walking and hiding the fact they shit themselves.\s\sThey said it was one of the best questions of the night.Lmao Seth baked on stage handing out Timbits to passing fans sounds like one hell of a time. He looks like a perfect 50/50 of his parents.Aww look how proud they are. I saw them on a late night talk show segment something about ""which celeb's parents are these"" and I didn't guess it at the time but it's undeniable now 😂 they seem super sweetJesus Christ they look like the nicest fucking people on the planetI wish I could have a relationship with my parents I wonder who he geta his laugh from. I bet they are so proud of himTIL Seth's mom is Professor TrelawneyI love Seth Rogan 😍His dad looks like he appreciates even his raunchiest movies.Ellen broke bread with babykiller Bush.Your gonna be downvoted to hell delete while you canHis dad looks like he has the same laugh. How does Seth Rogan look identical to both his parents at the same time wtf. My parents rule\s\s*HEH.*I wish I had parents like that but it's no problem I don't because I am definitely a Mom like that! They were hippies for sure.. cool parentsI bet they laugh just like himWholesomeness detectedI bet you his dad laughs the same way he does. Look at that happy face.Another reason why Seth Rogan is the coolest...This made my cold heart warm up. That’s one way to guarantee not having to fight to find a parking spot Seth’s dad is Rob Reiner??He always seems slightly confused about his fame.  I know what you mean. But imagine being super high only everyone you see knows who you are expects you to always be funny and wants to take a selfie with you. I’d probably look slightly confused too.Dude probably walked into the wrong interview & kept rolling with it.Maybe he still lives in their basement and asks them for rides?Because he's an ""everyman"". He is the epitome of a dude you know at work.Madam trelawny is Seth's mom? r/entitledparents has left the chatWholesome asfThey look so proud. His mom looks like a hippieIs the mom the woman who played the “Profit” person in Harry Potter?Seth Rogan is so unfunny.  He never said a funny thing. It’s all just spectating on thingsI’d like to hear their laugh I use to think Seth was just a raunchy comedian just in it for the money(not in a bad way or anything)  but I started paying attention and the amount of amazing projects he’s had his hands on is impressive and he’s really a excellent producer/writer/director/actor. Then I saw his Hilarity for Charity and the work he and his wife have done for families of Alzheimer’s patients is absolutely inspiring. They do amazing work.  I’ve seen first hand how hard it can be having a family member with Alzheimer’s. Hats off to them. The movie where Seth is Adam Sandler's assistant  made me look into both of their backstories and charity work. Actors and actresses are severely overlook when it comes to charity work i feelOMG it's future Lee SyattHis dad is the guy in Pineapple Express that throws the bat and hits Jonah Hill right? While they escape through a backyard?[deleted][deleted]But you’re their favorite-one. Why does his dad look like Jonah Hill in costume?Actually Jonah Hill is his dad in costumeBecause he isAnd his mom looks like Fred Armison in costumeSandy Rogen has a very funny TwitterI didn't know professor trelawney had a daughter.All the way from Vancouver?Wow! Parents doing Parent things but it’s wholesome because he is famous I really don’t find him funny in most his movies but I like listening to him talk as himself in about anything and ever story about him is always nice.They look exactly like I'd imagine Seth Rogans parents would lookDid he also use his fake forced laugh?Even his parents look highFuckin goals dudeKing of the moms basement gangI wonder who he geta his laugh from. And they appear exactly as I expected them to.they look EXACTLY what id expect one of the most prolific stoners parents to look likeStill rocking that wardrobe they haven’t updated since 1975I’m jealous of the probable fact that they all smoke together.Same. I see where he gets it all from now his looks his build his clothing choices/fashion sense all of it. Like 100% those are his parents and it's awesome they go out with him like this. Hopefully they all get to keep that tradition up for a while. \s\sDo they just go with him to Ellen I'm assuming they live close if they drove him? Or do they have any other fun shows like seeing with him? How cool would that be to be like hey mom and dad I'm going on such and such shows next week wanna come along? That would be tight to be able to do. If I'd had ever gotten really famous I'd have taken my Mom to all those type things if she wanted but well she is gone now so it it's too late for that. Besides my acting career kind of fell out there for a while beforehand anyway and the whole castle getting trapped in the sun in '99 thing didn't help either and what really didn't help was that when my kind did come back to the spotlight everyone wanted the pretty ones the kind that sparkle. It's cool though I'm not really cut out for the spotlight if I'm being honest I still prefer the shadows and one of these days the castle will be back up and causing chaos across the land so none of this will end up mattering anyway. ""Wow I wonder how his parents are with lots of his talk show anecdotes being about smoking a bunch of weed?""\s\s\>sees picture of parents\s\s""Oh I see never mind.""They look like they own some garden co-op where everyone trades vegetables like currency. \sWho cares?I think you miss the point of this subreddit. It's wholesome and a lot of people find this wholesome as it shows that despite having gone off on his own and being sucessful his parents still care about him enough so to drive him there despite the fact he could probably get there however he liked.\sI’ve never seen someone so perfectly embody the culmination of two people before. Amazing.Look up Blake Griffin with his parents.\s\sEdit: I did it for you: [https://i.imgur.com/v6YAabR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/v6YAabR.jpg)I think Seth Rogen is an extremely overrated actor but that is so cool that he and his folks are so close. \s\sHis Dad looks high AF.probably because he was too highThat's a long drive considering they live in Vancouver Is Seth’s mom Professor Trelawney?I first saw the picture then read the captions. I thought exactly the same! Might have to do with the fact that I watched Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix this morning. Indeed so that’s why I can predict the future.First thing I thought!This is the best thing I have heard in a while. I wish everyone would have parents like that!This is adorable.  Also the Rogans are clearly hippies. They look like BC hippies to me lolThey look like what you’d make stereotypical hippie parents in a movie look like We are very proud of the fact that they are BC hippies (to the point where we made Seth Rogen do our temporary transit announcements.) So accurate.Yep they look like OG Kits hippies having pancakes at the Naam.Seth Rogers dad looks how Seth Rogers laugh sounds Papa Rogan high afMy parents can't even be bothered to drive an hour to visit me and force me to always have to come to them.\s\sThey haven't even seen the last 3 places I've lived and they never call unless it's a holiday.\s\sthere's no malicious intent just no one gives a fuck about me.\s\sIt must be nice to have parents.Get rich and give them money Seth: hue hue hue hue\s\sSeth's dad: **hue hue hue hue**\s\sSeth's mom: *hue hue hue hue*Professor Trelawney?The hd is so good you can see Ellen’s breath when she’s talking to Seth!omg he’s such a quirky relatable bro! HUHUHUHUH cue the weeping My parents would do this ❤️Lol! I would love to hear his siblings talk about this while drunk.\sSeth Seth SETH! its all about Seth lmaoSource?Wonder if they were on The Eric Andre Show on Seth's episodeWhat's your cell phone number?Are his parents the yoyng couple from All in the Family? I didn't know it was possible to look like more of a pothead than Seth Rogen but now it all makes sense.They look like they smoke just as much pot as he does[removed]RT of the year that was fantastic.Her whole Twitter is gold lol. Okay the guy who tweets back at her exactly which terminal and gate this is that makes this next level funny. That's really cute XDI flew to Toronto this year and had the exact same excitement when I went to the airport bathroom. It. Was. So. Nice!!True story. I went into a bathroom with 15 empty stalls to pee. The next woman that walked in went into the stall beside mine. It was the biggest WTF moment of my life and I regret not asking her whyI hope you scrolled down and saw the awesome cartoon someone made about it user name Brady bunch. *Knocked Up* ... 40 years later.Resident Evil 7Is it just me or his dad's face looks like it's badly photoshoped inLol I thought the same thing Prof. Trelawney?They look so proud of him.

He literally looks like you mashed his parents togetherThey look so proud!!You’d be proud too if your stoner son grew up to be one of the most successful actors/writers/comedians of his time.

You’re well on your way!by the way sandy rogen is on twitter and embarrasses him constantlySandy Rogen has a wholesome Twitter account tooThey look exactly like what I thought they would. There's an episode of one of the Jimmy's interviewing Seth Mcfarlane and his dad is just an old hippy talking about getting high with seth on Thanksgiving. Wholesome Seth parenting. I got a cuz who looks so much like Seth when I first saw him in a movie I thought it WAS my cuz 😂It looks like if you combine those two people you'd get Seth Rogan.He is probably following his old wonderful daysAw! I just won some design awards last night and my parents came and watched!

Anyone seen Seth’s YT video on how to roll a joint the right way?I learned to roll using that video a few years back!BC Hippies are some of the best hippies I thought this was cute and funny and then I actually pictured them driving him there and realized he had to have sat in the back seat and it made it even better.

They are just so happy to be thereRemember the Twitter moment with Seth and Sandy?You can tell Seth was the product of the 60’s hippy movement.I can hear him at home: MOM THE MEATLOAF I WANT IT NOWNo doubt at all those are his parents! He’s like a clone of them!I don’t know how I expected Seth Rohan’s Parents to look but they are 100% his parents \s\sGod I love Seth RoganSure but when *I* get a lift from my folks to an interview and have them watch the whole thing from a respectable distance it's all ""we don't think you're the right fit for this organization.""Oh wow that woman is DEFINITELY Seth Rogan's mom.Her name is Sandy and she's a really nice lady.

I think we all screamed for at least five minutes. You see comrade we block door then cant have school. No school mean no homework comradeLucky. We had indoor recess when one flake falls You must not be from the Midwest I remember us doing this as kids (Minnesota).  All they did was bring us in though a different set of doors and then we didn't have recess for a week because somebody (us kids) blocked the door to the play ground and we couldn't have recess until it was cleared out.\s \sI think now it only lasted a week because recess and lunch were the only break the teachers had from the kids and they complained it needed to be resolved.I'm repost the fuck out of this on facebook.There is nothing wholesome about communismToo bad thats probably not the only doorAt school we built an ice ramp to get over the fenceif the teachers cant dig out in 15 minutes legally of course all the kids can go home.

\sI am a creature of habit. I don't like new things in an unfamiliar environment I'm very set in where I do my shopping that sort of thing. Every day on my way in to work I stop by the same convenience store to get a drink a bag of chips and sometimes a peanut butter cookie from that ""Grandma's"" brand. This has been an ongoing thing since I was promoted to another department with normal working hours probably for about the past two years. The same person is usually at the register. She's an African American woman who is often on a bluetooth headset having a conversation with someone in a language I don't understand it sounds African she may be an immigrant. All I really know is that even with the language barrier that whomever she is speaking to is someone she cares deeply for with all of her soul. \s\sAnyway I took vacation last year. Vacation for me is a week of not leaving my home playing with my cat getting some cleaning done and probably playing a crap ton of video games. I came back the next week and when I got to the register I found myself being chastised because she did not see me all last week.\s\sI was very taken back and it was a feeling that I'm not used to experiencing. I don't think a lot of myself in fact I think incredibly poorly of myself and in general consider myself a bad person for the thoughts I have sometimes. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder if my mother and others would be better off just having the insurance money from my death. It was.. foreign to me that someone noticed I wasn't around. I've often assumed that if I died in my sleep it would be a couple of days before someone realized something had happened to me. \s\sBut no... the kind woman with her bluetooth headset who always has my items bagged by the time I've swiped my card notices it if I don't come in at my usual time. And what's funny is that when she isn't there I find myself annoyed with whomever is at the register because I have to ask them to do things she just does as part of her job to make her day better for her customers. I couldn't tell you anything about her other than that she has a genuinely kind smile and has very lively conversations in a language I can't understand with someone whom she loves very much and that somehow this person telling me to have a good day makes me feel like any other person in the world: the people I find myself wishing I was.People care.\s\sI don't know you and I'm a grown ass adult who just had a tear come to my eye while reading this.\s\sGood luck stranger. Hey. I know how you feel. Brutal feeling for sure. People do care though. Life is just busy.\s\s\sI had a total implosion from this feeling once. I was like 6 months single out of an 8 year relationship and in a city where literally all of my friends I hung out with regularly were her family members (brothers cousins) so I was suddenly just alone. They still loved me or whatever but it was awkward so we just cut ties. \s\s\sI was finishing my degree so I just did math all day and worked in a kitchen all night. I had supported her through her school and she was supposed to do the same for me but that didn’t happen. As a consequence I didn’t really have time to branch out socially while finishing my degree as I had to work to put myself through school. Outside of work talk in the kitchen the only people I spoke to were bus drivers baristas and the girl who scanned my pass at my gym every day. I wasn’t really conscious of this though I was just going through the motions.\s\s\sOne day while doing math alone in my room I had this crazy moment that came totally out of nowhere. I mean I was so focused on my school work I wasn’t thinking about my life at all but my brain suddenly on its own switched gears completely and I realized all at once I couldn’t remember the last time someone was happy to see me. I just felt this deep aching loneliness and broke down crying. It was so weird I didn’t know all that empty was there until then. It showed me how important a social life can be for people. I didn’t realize it until I felt it’s absence but I think a feeling of belonging in a intimate community like a tribe is deeply important to a healthy and fulfilling life.That s beautiful and sad. May I offer a suggestion? Ask her what language she's speaking.\s\sYou might do nothing more than that. You might have a short conversation. Find out some interesting things about where she's from. Or just chat about the weather. Connecting to another human especially someone who noticed you exist can be very powerful when you feel bad. Hey there internet stranger I don't know you but you matter to me too (✿◠‿◠)Want to seriously change your world?  Tell her how much that little interaction of hers meant to you.  Its astonishing how people will just open when you do that.\sI made someone in my class realise a similar thing. She's a genuinely wonderful person. Warms a room by being herself and has helped me through some dark stuff. But before we started talking properly I got her on Facebook and next day I noticed that again she had come in late and that she didn't hang around at lunch. When I messaged her about it she spent 15 min asking how I noticed. That was when I realised how little she thought of herself and made a promise to show her the person we all see which is so amazing is the real her. And that she's looking at herself with a negative bias. Reading your story gave me more hope that I can succeed in that task incidentally she is trying to do the same thing for me.[Well then....](https://i.imgur.com/iPEFV7c.gif)Ya got me all teary eyed over here. You sound like me. I have a bus driver that knew I was always running to the bus and he’d see me across the street and give me he thumbs up like I see you I’m waiting for your late ass and it seriously just made me feel like maybe I am seen. Maybe someone sees me!! And they’re gonna wait for me. Anyway I feel you. These moments you share can really keep you going. It’s real nice to be seen.Not right now but I have definitely spent times of life where I wondered ‘if I slipped in the shower and died how long would it be before anyone actually came looking for me?  Work would just fire me and classes would just assume I dropped out.’  Cities can be very lonely places.If you fall so you cover the drain and you live in an apartment it might only be a matter of hours before they break down the door/use a master key to come see what's causing the flooding/water damage.\s\sWeird work that they wouldn't at least call after you first not that that would help of course. Definitely understandable that they wouldn't file a missing persons report.\s\sSorry to be so dark. :/ You probably do have people even if they're ""only"" familiar strangers who would miss you if you died.This makes me think of when you're on a long road trip and you drive a stretch of 50-100 miles with the same car/s and then you or one of them gets off at an exit.\s\sFarewell fellow traveler. Male nurse who took the 2 o'clock bus every Friday 5 years ago I hope you are doing well.I work at a gas station and it’s amazing. All of the morning regulars know each other just from coming into the gas station for coffee and cigarettes in the morning. They chat while they make their coffees and tell each other to have a good one before they leave. Sometimes they even buy each other’s coffee or pop. They don’t know each other from anywhere else but the gas station. It’s wonderful. Mornings are my favorite parts of working midnights. I work at a grocery store and mornings are the best!Yeah I have a similar situation except I work the overnight at the gas station and that’s when the crackheads show up to buy their glass roses and chore bores. It’s truly touching the way they yell at me when the prices on their cigarettes go up as if I had anything to do with the change. It really is beautifully odd.  I have a clockwork schedule in the AM and for the last ~two years when I stop at the gas station this older retired guy is getting coffee at the same time.  With no more interaction than small-talk waiting in line it's eventually morphed into him giving me a fist-bump practically every morning and some variation of 'Give 'em hell today kid'.  He's like my morning hypeman.I have placements as part of my training that last 6 weeks at a time. Just enough to develop familiar strangers and have them torn away when I start somewhere new. 💔We all just gonna ignore that profile pic? AlrightI have a similar story. \s\sBack in college one of my classes I sat next to this one kid who was foreign he was Marshallese. Anyways he would always get there before me and he always had his stuff on my desk. And he’d move it when I eventually got there. It got annoying after a couple of weeks. And it was too late to find a new seat because while we didn’t have assigned seats everybody kind of sat in the same spot everyday so there were no open seats. So I just dealt with it. We didn’t talk much if at all. But he’d do it everyday. Have his stuff all over my desk and when I’d sit down he moved it to his desk. \s\sThen one day I walk in I was later than usual and some girl tries to sit where I usually sit. Next to this Marshallese guy. And the guy says “sorry this seat is saved” . I come over and he goes “hey Daniel i saved you a seat”. I felt like an ass thinking he was just being inconsiderate putting his shit on my desk he was making sure no one would sit in my seat. I talked to him more after that. I did that in college too. I’m a non-traditional student (aka old when compared to the 18-22yo) and I noticed these two girls that had to basically sprint across campus to get to our class and they really wanted to do well so they wanted good seats for the lecture but it was just hard to get them because they would barely make it to class on time. They didn’t know I heard their laments nor did they know that was my first class of the day so I could get there whenever I wanted.\sThe next class they sprinted towards the front before looking dejected because everything was taken. I motioned for them to come over and moved my stuff. The rest of the semester I saved seats for them and I think we only ever said “Thanks” and “no problem” to each other. I’d do it again in a heartbeat. “We still don’t talk to each other sometimes. Best friend I ever had!”I once worked with a guy for 3 years and never learned his name.  Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.So no ones gonna mention the thicc trump profile pic?Wholesome travelling friendsThere was an older black man who was a sign holder for a phone company a few blocks from my house who id trade a wave with for years. I was known as the “the surfer white boy with the music” around my area because of my 3x 12’s crammed in my small 2002 civic trunk and a 14 ft paddleboard that was almost always strapped to the roof ([for reference on how silly it looked](https://m.imgur.com/90igr6y)). I was a social worker and paddleboarded every day after or before work for 1 year straight so often times I’d just leave it strapped on my roof.  \s You could hear me coming from a while down the street so he was always ready to throw me a slick “you da man” finger point and I’d return em. I went to California for 3 weeks to visit my dad after I finished my AmeriCorp term earlier (had 3 weeks paid vacation) and upon returning finally met him one day at the store. He thought id been attacked by a shark or drowned and was worried about me was a pretty eye opening moment that someone who didn’t know me could feel any feelings towards me.A good friend of mine and I went to the same university and worked upstairs there at our internships together. On our lunch breaks every now and then we would walk downtown and grab sushi to go. The same girl behind the counter was  always there to take our order. The more we got sushi the more she would accommodate us with free tea a friendly smile a more casual attitude etc. I ended up graduating a semester early and moved to Alaska. My friend told me that after I left the girl asked her once in shy broken English “Where is your friend?” \s\sThat was the only time I had ever heard of her saying more than two words.\s\s6 months later I visited town and my friend and I  decided to go back there for old times sake. When she saw us walk in together the girl’s face lit up and she yelled “Together again!”\s\sI still have no idea what her name is or if I’ll ever see her again but I miss her in a weird way.It's weird how I only need to see people's faces once and even after 4 years without seeing them I would know them but never talked to them not even once.There was like a 40-50 yr old dude who'd sit beside me on the bus every morning...(for context bus has 2 rows of 2 seats back to back) and id much rather put my bag on the seat beside me if no1 is sitting there.\s\sbut no ..like im pretty sure there aer empty seats but he'd scour the bus for me and sit beside me every..single..morning.\s\sI now catch the bus 30 mins earlier just to avoid himThis is a thing. It's called familiar strangers.\s\sFrom Wikipedia: Familiar stranger...\s\s"" *A familiar stranger is an individual who is recognized by another from regularly sharing a common physical space such as a street or bus stop but with whom one does not interact. First identified by Stanley Milgram in the 1972 paper The Familiar Stranger: An Aspect of Urban Anonymity* ""\s\s*I Would like to thank you all and express my thanks that my anal warts comments were overrated.I have about a half dozen people I regularly see at my home station or who get off at the same part of the platform in the city as me. I don't know their names. We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down I'll go to war for them.I had tons of these when I lived downtown in a large urban center. This one dude and I had almost the exact same sleep schedule and our dogs had synchronized bladders. Almost every night I’d be across the street with my dog and I’d look up and he’d be kitty corner away from me with his corgi.\s\sOur dogs always and without fail would scream at each other but for whatever reason he and I never interacted. We’d kind of exchange sheepish looks while our dogs barked their faces off and then we’d each haul them away in opposite directions.\s\sThe song and dance went on for almost two years and then I moved. I hope he’s well. A Swanson familiar. \s\s\s“I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.”When I studied in Europe I'd pass the same prostitute in her van every afternoon. I never did more than say a hello as I'd walk by. I was going to wish her well on my last day before leaving but I forgot she doesn't park in her usual spot on the weekend. I wonder if she ever wondered about me and why I disappeared.[deleted]Milgram made several interesting studies. Apart from the one you mentioned and the famous Milgram experiment he also examined the six degrees of separation theory.\s\sEdit: now that I think about it several sounds like a lot but he did some interesting experiments.I have placements as part of my training that last 6 weeks at a time. Just enough to develop familiar strangers and have them torn away when I start somewhere new. 💔In public I couldn't be chillier. \s\s*He'll miss me? Man I've grown sillier.*\s\sBut he said he missed me\s\sIt felt like he kissed me\s\sNot friends but this stranger's familiar. This is my morning gym crew. Theres a core like 10ish of us and another 10-15 that are seasonal and always change. But the core 10ish of us..no idea who they are but we’re the everyday 6am crewNeat I like thisIn my way to school i always see the blue hoodie man the bicycle guy 2 to 4 dogs and sometimes the red hoodie guy.Screw this.  That guy in the black Tahoe and the woman in the little silver car I see in the drive thru line at McDonalds almost every single day....Monday morning they are gonna know my name and breakfast is on me.  (unless they are ordering one of those McCafe things that backs the damn line up.  Focus people one biscuit one regular drink per person.  You want to get fancy walk your ass inside.)\sI don’t know if this has already been mentioned but it reminds me of this a bit: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/7rDjDThis is crazy. I've always wanted to know if there was a name for this concept.  \s\sLike at my gym I probably have 150 familiar strangers where I don't know them personally I don't even know their names I never talk to any of them but I have a feeling like we all know each other type of thing I feel comfortable around them because I'm just used to their familiar energies and their presence.  \s\sThank you for finding an actual term for what I've been experiencing for years.I had this with a lot of people in my gym a couple years ago. One of the reasons it's so hard to pick it back up is that I've got social anxiety and now I don't recognize anyone there anymore.I like the word “propinquity” Which before the internets was how couples mostly ended up together. Propinquity. If I see somebody every day I start saying hi after a while or at least hit em with the nod of acknowledgement upon seeing them. I saw this guy in a early 2000s Audi A4 on the road everyday coming home from work. I rode my motorcycle everyday. I noticed him so I started waving at him. After a while he started waving back. So I start doing crazier things like pointing at him doing like the anime double peace signs to him even standing on my pegs and waving to him. He started doing his things too. Almost a year this goes on then I got transferred. That poor guy probably thinks I died in a wreck or something.  I’m still alive Audi bro.I had something similar happen to me except a little different.\s\sI used to commute to West side of Los Angeles on my motorcycle everyday for 5 years. It's one of the hardest rides to do because its two hours a day in what I explain to people as two cheese graters setup and look down the middle thats what splitting LA traffic is like and I would always spot the same brown Mercury Grand Marquis more of that old woman gold color. I would see this same car going almost the identical route as me and would catch her car in traffic from time to time. So after doing this commute and occasionally we would wave at each other and one time I stopped at a light on my way home before getting on the free way to see her right next to me. I opened my helmet a bit and said ""Hi I'm gotfondue I always see you in traffic!"" She smiled and laughed and said ""yeah me too! small world!""\s\sAfter a bit of time passed I ended up getting a new job but never really saw her after that. Until 3 years later at my new job which is down the street from my house I saw her car in the parking lot. Now you're probably asking how I knew it was her car she had a very distinct licenses plate that stuck in my head. So I left her a note to call me since I was the random motorcycle guy in traffic. Sure enough I got a call from her and we had a good hour long conversation about what we were doing and all that jazz. She said to me ""I am so glad I found out you're not dead! I would tell my husband 'I wonder if that guy that I saw in traffic finally died' so I am really glad you're not dead!""\s\sReally made me smile! That was all.This made me smile. Its always a good feeling to be remembered by someone. A little extra special when you don't even know that someone. :pI used to get the bus to work and there was this girl that used to get on the bus too and I'd always look out for her as I had a crush on her. \s\sThis went on for a few months always waiting for her to get on the bus. I was plucking up the courage to speak to her but I know in the morning on the way to work that people aren't in the best of moods.\s\sUnfortunately I then got made redundant from that job and so had  stopped taking that bus I was absolutely gutted.\s\sMany months later I was at a club and there she was the girl from the bus I had a few bottles of liquid courage by this time and so now I started talking to her. The best thing is she recognised me from the bus too and said she had a crush on me too. We hit off straight away we've now been together for 2 years. Why was the fact that he was indian important?Sorry I'm drunk but this is just so beautiful? I criedI had a ""highway walking"" buddy. I walked the highway in my little town to the library about four times a week throughout my childhood. He was always on the opposite side of the highway walking the opposite way of me.  We always nodded to eachother but other than our highway walks we had never seen eachother before. Odd considering my hometown has a population of 350-ish. Well one day I walked to the library about half an hour earlier than I usually do and found him sitting right next to the computer that I always use if available. I said whats up and started a conversation. Turns out he leaves the library as I'm on my way. Familiar strangers. When I was working the early early morning shift at Wal-Mart this guy would come in just getting off of work buy some liquor and go home. He'd always come into my check-out though and we'd talk. He called me Phoenix-Girl (we were both from Phoenix AZ) and in my head I called him Cheech (he looked and sounded a lot like a young Cheech Marin). Then one day he stopped coming in. I don't know what happened to him - maybe he lost his job or something. I just know that he was gone.There is even a popular book about such a thing... Girl on the Train or somethingI once commuted with a guy; never knew his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.There is an old guy who gets on my bus home from work each Tuesday and Thursday. I think he heads to the pool club because he always has a pool cue carrying case with him. We always smile and nod at each other and I dont know his name but he looks like a Colin.\s\sI havent seen Colin in three weeks and I genuinely miss him. Bumping into him on those days made me happy. Like a reminder Monday is gone and Friday is just around the corner each week.\s\sI hope Colin is ok.I lived next to this 80-year old for a year at my apartments and I would only see him occasionally due to my work schedule but I always made sure to say hello and wish him a great day. \s\sIt came time for me to leave the apartments and move out of state the day before I left he stopped me and wished me luck and basically reassure me that I would do great things in life.\s\sThe conversation kept going and it turns out he has no family or friends close by. I wanted to cry right then and there I regret not talking to him more. But I’m currently sending him a post card and wishing him well! \s\sCheck up on the elderly even if they’re just neighbors. It could make their day. When my family and I lived in Japan we stayed in a home in Ikego for a while.\sMy bus stop to take me to school on base was right next to a convenience store across the street from a line of homes facing it.\sEvery day at around 6-7 in the morning I would stand out there to wait and watch a businessman get into his car to go to work.\s\sAfter the first week or so he started bowing to me before he would get into his car and I politely bowed back. Sometimes we waved to one another but mostly we stuck to bowing.\s\sOne day months later it seems he was going to be gone a while I assume a business trip of some sort. His wife came out to see him off. After he closed his door and drove away his wife turned to me and gave me a deep formal bow.\s\sIt suddenly struck me then that he must have told her about me and the routine we shared. The fact that two (three technically) strangers could share such an emotional bond has never ceased to impact me.That is the best and somehow so Japanese. I love it. This is probably my favorite one in this thread. I have a couple relationships like that but it has never occurred to me to tell anyone about it. That's very heartwarming to hear thanks for sharingThere was a homeless guy in his 40s(?) with a big beard and in the same clothes etc who sat by where I get breakfast on the way to work. Every morning I would get him a coffee with milk and 3 sugars and a bacon roll. He would say ""thanks have a good day"" then I'd say ""no bother see you tomorrow"". I didn't know his name but he always seemed happy and grateful to just get breakfast. \s\sThis became a routine for almost a year then one day he wasn't there. Then the next and the next. I contacted the nearby shelters to see if they knew anything but I got nothing. I started feeling genuinely scared something had happened to him so I started asking any homeless people I met if they knew anything. But without a name I wasn't getting anywhere. \s\sA month or so went by and I had lost hope TBH but I still went for breakfast at the same place. Then one day when it came to paying a man stopped me and said it was on him. It took a while to register who it was but it was my nameless homeless friend he was in clean clothes and shaven looking better than ever. After having a chat it turns out he got a job after years of trying on the early shift at a local factory. He had just saved enough to put a deposit down on his first rented flat. He was there to repay me for getting him breakfast all those times. I have never felt happier for someone we still get breakfast time to time and he is doing well to this day :)This is a beautiful story. You both sound like great people :) This is so amazing and encouraging Thank you for sharing this. Thanks for sharing your breakfast. I live in FL & work at a restaurant.. we used to have this homeless man Gregory come in every day and order a soda and just sit at the bar and watch tv for hours to escape the heat. It’s so damn hot so we didn’t blame him and didn’t mind either. He always kept to himself. He had a couple bags that he would drop off at the host stand and we would make sure no one touched them. It became so routine we would just comp a dish and his soda for him every day. Then we were (indirectly) hit by a hurricane last season and everyone had to evacuate. No one saw him after that. We were all really worried and decided to raise money so that if he did come back he would have a little financial cushion. \s\sWell he never made his way back.. and I thought of him very often and worried about him. My late brother was homeless for a while at the peak of his mental illness and Gregory reminded me a lot of him. I was scared something happened to Greg as it’s a very hard life. \s\sUntil a few weeks ago. I’ve been going through a hard time and heartbreak so I’ve been seeing a therapist. Her office is on the opposite side of town an area I typically wouldn’t visit but it was the only practice I could get in. Well I was ubering the 40 minutes home and as I was sitting in the back seat starring out the window thinking about life we came to a stop at a light. Who do I see sitting at the bus stop? Gregory. \s\sI couldn’t help but smile really big. Maybe his circumstances haven’t dramatically changed it seemed like he’s still living on the streets... but he’s safe. Okay this one got me to cry. I’m so happy your friend got his break I always love story's about homeless people getting back up its amazingAwn I teared.Your story made me smile. Thank you. :-)Please tell me this is real :')Ducking onions You are great dude!""The 5:22"" by George Harrar is a great short story like this. LeVar Burton read it on his podcast.\shttps://pca.st/u95u\s\sEdit: LeVar not LavarThis is how I met my wife.Fun story I guess: I was commuting via CalTrain from San Jose to SF in the Spring of '08 and I noticed her on the platform at the same times. She always had a group of girls with her and I was alone. We saw each other often and would make eye contact but it was hard to get to talk; crowded trains and so forth.\s\sI ended up being able to sit with her group right across from her in fact one morning as the crowd was all rushing on the train. I was trying to think of the right thing to say and I got a text from a friend right then that Fidel Castro had given up power. I was genuinely shocked and I said out loud ""Wow it's the end of an era Fidel Castro just gave up power in Cuba."" She laughed and said ""Wow."" We laughed and didn't talk again for a few weeks. Finally one morning she had no friends around her and I struck up a conversation. Eventually I asked her to dinner we stretched dinner into seeing ""Be Kind Rewind"" and that was it. \s\sWe're together 10 years this past April and married 5 on Labor Day :)I'd love to hear more about this story!You guys need to grab lunch or a coffee. This could be a great friend for life! \s\sReminds me of the lady that ordered pizza everyday. One day she didn't order and the delivery folks got worried and called 911. Evidently they saved her life.I used to take the train to my very early job and sometimes I’d fall asleep on my way. I always sat in the same place and a woman who didn’t speak English always sat in the same place across from me. Without fail every day that I fell asleep she would wake me up at my stop. We never spoke otherwise but I always felt like she was my friend. How would she know it was your stop \s\sEdit: never mind I realized she just saw you get out at that stop when you weren’t sleepingActually this happened to me in highschool too I've fallen asleep in the bus and an old lady woke me up just at the station of a prestigious school saying it's your stop. \sIt made me feel really nice thinking she has that high expectations and waking me up. \sI rushed at the door and stopped as I realised it's not mine. It was the next one where there are bad schools. I felt so bad for ruining her expectations This inspired me to talk to my stranger today. This post had a strong impact on me.I have a bum foot.  I have compensated for it my whole life but now my back is falling apart because of it.\s\sAnyway I was on crutches for a couple months as a college freshman.  There was an older policeman with my university police force who drove a van getting several of us to classes in the morning. I was around a lot of older people as a kid and had been taught to respect them listen to their stories and be pleasant.  The other kids didn't really interact with him.\s\sOne day he looked at me kind of surprised and said ""I want your foot to get better so you don't need me any more but I'm gonna miss you!""  I told him I felt the same way.\s\sA couple weeks later and I didn't need him any more but I've never forgotten him.There was a girl I used to pass on my way to work every single morning in the same stretch of sidewalk. One morning I decided to say ""Hey good morning"". She looked at me kind of disgustingly and started walking on the other side of the road or at different times after that. Super lame! And no I'm not some sketchy looking creeper.Happy cake day!!!My mom used to go the same gas station every week to fill up. This is in Wisconsin and one morning it was snowing and she couldn’t find her ice scraper and the man from the gas station said “take one you come in everyday”.\s\sMy mom went back every week for another couple months before he just wasn’t there one morning. Turns out someone tried to rob the store the night before and shot him and he didn’t make it. It’s amazing the impact people have in our lives by simple gestures.Never knew each others names. Best friend I ever had. I still don't talk to him sometimes.I have the same morning routine as this one cute girl of going to the gym every morning and then eating breakfast at the same place. 5 more months and I might get the courage to speak to herI love this so much.This reminds me of a group I used to see on my way to drop my son off at daycare. Every morning I’d see two older woman walking arm in arm while two older men walked side by side behind them. They’d all be laughing and chatting and were out even on cold or rainy days. I always noticed how happy they looked.\s\sAnd then one day the two men and one women were walking three abreast down the sidewalk clinging desperately onto one another and sobbing as they walked slowly down the street.\s\sThe three of them continued their walking routine for as long as we lived there but I never saw them again without feeling a pang of sorrow.Jesus christ that's so subtly dark Reminds me of 5 people you meet in heaven by Mitch Albom.[deleted]I guess it's just the right amount of identification to share a story about?Because you get more fake internet points when you talk about an interaction with a minorityITT humanity relearning how to connect with each other. Check mate smartphones.There was this homeless man who I always passed by on my walk to work He always chilled at the same spot so l practically saw him every single day for a couple years. I never said a word to him sometimes I wouldn't even look in his direction. One day on my way to work i noticed there was a vigil where his belongings used to be and I dont know why but i was suddenly overwhelmed with sadness. I never saw him ever interact with anyone! he never asked for money i dont think i ever head him speak a word. but here was this vigil filled  with candles flowers letters and a couple  rosarys for him. He probably never spoke a word  to any of those people even so his death was still mourned and he will be missed by the strangers that never spoke a word to him simply because he was part of everyones (including myself) daily routine. R.I.P stranger hopfully you're in a better place. wherever that place may be. Something similar happened to me in college.  Jumped on this bus before class and saw this Hispanic mother with her daughter. I sat across and smiled at them but the daughter was shy and didn’t respond. That’s okay no worries.\s\sSo went to class had lunch on campus and maybe a meeting went back on the bus. And what are the chances but the same woman and daughter were there hours later - the little girl recognized me and had the most genuine smile as she realized the coincidence and tried to tell her mom. Our minds were both silently mind blown but in total silence. Always makes me smile when I think about it.No matter how alone you feel you've touched many people's hearts just by being. 99% of the time you'll never know how or how much or to whom but unspoken love and affection fills every inch of the space in-between us.Post is wholesome and all but can we take a look at that profile picture?Coool story and all but why do you have to state that he’s Indian? Why you got white in your name?A buddy and I were recently thanked by a convenient store worker on his last day he was moving from the area for being nice people. We frequent the store multiple times a day and never thought anything of it. It really astounded us that we were thanked for something we considered someone shouldn't be thanked for just being what we considered human. Crazy seeing how much without intention people can influence others by their simple actions.https://i.imgur.com/tkUDNSx.jpgRip xbox I love this kind of thing. It makes surroundings so comfy. What is that pfpI love this and the fact that everyone on this thread shares similar experiences 🤙🏼I used to have a bus ride like this. There was this nice dude and his daughter that would share most of the same route and time (he'd get off a few stops earlier and drop his daughter off at preschool then continue to roughly where I worked too). We'd make a bit of small talk from time-to-time.\s\sOne week I had to go in early and so we rode at different times. When I resumed my regular schedule he explained that's it's common in Chinese culture for children to refer to parents' friends as ""Uncle"" regardless biological relationships and when I was not on the bus after a few days she asked her Dad ""where's uncle?"".[deleted]I also have a commute buddy. Never spoken to him. I feel like I should but it's just one of those weird things I think would be awkward. The best part is the other day I ran into him in the middle of the day on a weekend! \s\sAnyways for those who know Vonnegut I consider these sorts of people part of my Karass.If you talk to him once you will have to talk to him forever. ""I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes."" -Ron SwansonRon Swanson must be a bit Finnish.I like that the picture of her has trumps face superimposed. Thickest trump I have seen yetIf I looked like that I'm sure people would miss me too. When someone says something like this I always wonder what the nationality of the person had to do with anything. I think it's just a way of giving him a little life while showing they know nothing about him because they haven't spoken. It doesn't matter if you then imagine him looking like Gandhi Geronimo or an old Indian friend of yours he has a face now and is a little more of a person to you. For some people he might speak in an accent although he didn't to me.Whether fact or fiction it is still a story. The better you know the characters the deeper connection you will feel to them.  Character driven stories would feel pretty empty if we didn't have a way to see them in our minds eye.  \s\sHonestly though I think you made this comment to try to imply it is somehow wrong or racist to include someones race in a story. As though the author of the story included ur to shock the reader.  as  though an Indian man would be friendly is strange?  \s\sMaybe you can explain it better to me since your the one who brought it up.  What exactly is negative about mentioning their nationality to build the character? It is an honest question because I don't currently understand it.I think it's best not to overthink this it's just short way of describing what the person looks like.When someone asks something like this I always wonder if they’re trying to start an argument and show others how superior they are. Please note MissMatieMae15's post history. This comment is in my opinion uncalled for. Especially by someone showing such low class. \sedit to add: How could mentioning someones nationality possibly be wrong? It's just a description of a person and if you think listing an objective characteristic is bad maybe you should look at yourself. It paints a portrait instead of imaging a fucking blob you imagine an Indian man. Like adjectives are a thing There is this one regular I see on my commute almost every day. Every time we see each other it’s always sneaky eye contact. Like looking at each other but not actually acknowledging each other.\s\sI feel like too awkward to say anything now so whenever it happens I start laughing to myself so I look like an even crazier person so yeah.I can be socially awkward/anxious but sometimes will just think fuck it what do I have to lose and interact with that person. And have always felt better for doing it no matter what the outcome.Next time you see them show them this tweet and say “After reading this I thought I should introduce myself.  My name is Roses and Tulips it’s nice to finally meet you.  I hope you have a nice day.”Just shoot a quick smile with a slight head nod. Basically the ""Hey"" that you give to some that you know and like but not well enough to stop and talk to. It sounds like you both are curious about each other but are too shy to make first contact. \s\sWorst that can happen is that their brain will go into socially awkward overdrive and they'll quickly look away. You tried no one died and you can still ignore each other from the corner of your eye if need be. Or maybe they'll smile back before you both go back to being too nervous to talk and that can be your new ritual. \s\sEither way it's a net positive. I know exactly how you feel I had the same thing with a girl who worked across from me every Tuesday. I had a hunch that the eye contact and sideways glances weren't just coincidence but told myself it was all in my head to make myself feel better for not having the guts to go and talk to her.\s\sOne week I made a snap decision to just go over and say hello it wasn't like me and I was way out of my comfort zone. As I was walking over I didn't even know what I was going to follow the hello up with.\s\sIt was a bit uncomfortable at first but it turned out she'd been hoping I'd go over and break the ice because she kept bottling out of doing the same.\s\sThis year we've been together 10 years and had two kids together. I sometimes wonder how different my life would be now if I hadn't made that snap decision. Looking back I know if I'd given it just an extra second of thought I wouldn't have gone over.I had a summer job and I would take the same bus after work to the train station. I always greeted the bus driver when I got on and thanked him when I left.\s\sOne day I missed the bus and took the next one. The next day he asked where I was yesterday. It turned out that that particular route was driven by two buses so from then on out if I missed my bus I'd intentionally skip the next one to catch him.\s\sMy summer job ended in August and he told me that he'd be assigned a new bus line in September. (I also learned that bus drivers have no say in this process!) This was about four years ago and I've since moved back to that city. Every time I see a bus I wonder if I'll see my friend again.There’s this license plate that says “I ❤️ Bacon” and I see it at least once a week on my way to/from work... it’s been a few weeks and I’m worried the driver has either A) moved; B) changed their plate; or C) met an ill fate. 😕 Hope the bacon lover of metro Detroit is doing well! 😄My office building has a restaurant on the ground floor and every morning I go in to get a small bite to eat...a banana diced fruit omelette etc.  I've worked in this building for 5 years now and while everyone is polite and friendly there's one woman in particular (usually working the cash register) that I talk to every single day.  \s\sShe's originally from Mexico but has lived here for around 10 years.  Over the past two years she's been teaching me new Spanish words and I return the favor by teaching her English. It started with me just asking how do you say bananas or strawberries but now we're way off  the menu.  We have such a warm bond despite the slight language barrier... I know all about her family and how her kids are doing in school her parents back home etc.  It makes my day every morning to talk to her and we both notice when the other isn't around.  It's now to the point where most of the staff talks to me like a real person instead of a transaction (there's several thousand people working in this building so most are just a blur in the crowd).  \s\sThere's another woman who is one of the lobby security staff who I talk to on a regular basis.  I'm in my 30s and she (~50?)  has two high-schoolers so she's been asking me for advice on how to deal with them when they break rules how to motivate them to get a job or good grades what colleges to look at etc.  Again I get a smile on my face every time I see her.\s\sOne more....I also met one of my best friends at the train stop... Same deal we saw each other every day going to and from work and eventually one of us introduced ourselves. We've actually discussed it and can't remember who talked to who first but we've been friends for 7 to 8 years now even with a 10 year age gap.\s\sIf you see the same person everyday talk to them.  Not just a bullshit hi actually engage.  Worst case the other is standoffish and you don't talk again and more than likely you'll make someone else feel happy.  You might even meet a life long friend.[deleted]I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never speak sometimes.i scrolled and scrolled until i lost patience and just control f-ed for the fucking ron swanson reference. [100% this is a ron best friendship](http://i.imgur.com/tkUDNSx.jpg) -- except it was ruined when the indian guy spoke but other than that total bff material. Why don't they carpoolI had this friend on a game called Wizard101 for like 6 years I never met him in real life but we would always arrange time to meet in the game and talk about life we met during a boss fight it came to the point where we became best friends we would legit buy in- game currency and stuff. One day I stopped seeing him and turns out he was a cancer patient. I still love you my Best Friend Nicolas Henry.This brought a smile to my face. We don’t realize what and who we have in our lives sometimes. For the last two years on my way to highschool this guy and me had opposite commutes we would pass by each other at certain point of our path.\sAt first this guy had REALLY long hair and had his head tilted to the left since the wind would constantly mess his hair up and he constantly tried to comb his hair.\s\sNow he has a scrunchie and some sort of pigtail but he looks much cooler and he has finally stopped constantly combing his hair.\s\sEven though we have never talked we smile at each other when we pass by :)[Best Friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes. ](https://i.imgur.com/tkzCzDk.jpg)There is this guy that makes sushi in a grocery store near me. I go there a lot because it's good. I don't know his name but just the other was the first time we actually said more than hi. Ask his name. It’s not weirdWhy does his ethnicity matter?\s\sEdit: go ahead and downvote me aurora it doesn’t make you less wrong. \s\sEdit 2: the more I think about this the more upset I get. This is the problem with our society you have to have or see a race to make a story relevant when race has no place or meaning in this story. You don’t understand the impact you have on someone else’s life until you aren’t there. Just because they never spoke a special connection can still form and I think that’s beautiful I moved to my first apartment about 3 years ago. Everyday before work I drive to the gas station across the street and this older gentleman would be there either gassing up his corvette or wiping it down. We’d never say hi how are you or anything for that matter. I noticed him every day and still do to this day. It’ll be pretty sad when we no longer “greet” each other in the mornings. I used to see a girl every day outside of a library for a few years never spoke to her then my family moved away. Few years later I get to high school and sit next to a girl start talking to her become best friends and she mentioned how close we could have been if we made friends those years back. I never made the connection until then and it was amazing. She said she missed me when I disappeared and I thought of her sometimes.When I was in high school working at a Piggly Wiggly an older couple opened a little bistro restaurant. I'd go over there on my breaks and they always treated me like a son. Then they were just closed up and gone one day. Met the man a few years later and his wife caught cancer and died then he moved. He told me that she always looked forward to when i come over for a burger and told her friends about me. Really good people i didnt even realize i had that kind of impact on themI once heard of the proximity effect which says that just by being in close proximity to people for extended periods of time you begin to develop emotional attachments to them... even bullies and their victims had some sort of emotional appreciation for each other over time... amazing what social creatures we areYou can't control who's part of your life but you can control who's life you're part of. I should start talking to my daily strangers. That's how I feel when I've been behind someone for hours on a long drive and then they exit. Feels bad man.You wanna know when your life is probably going in the wrong direction?  The person who would first notice that I’m not around anymore would be the Chinese lady who works at the liquor store.When I moved to a new school in fifth grade I took my bike to school a 5 km trip yet everyday I would meet these two older gentlemen. They would always be at the same place plus minus 50 meters taking their dogs out. Every morning for all those years. But then one year in 8th grade one of the guys was missing his dog. I immediately felt so sorry. Having thought about it all day I discussed it with my sister who was a year younger and she said she'd noticed the same thing. Empathy's a fucker.It's pretty neat actually. When i worked at a grocery store years ago (like 12) there was one lady and her husband that used to shop every few days. I began to recognize them (and them probably me) but the lady always looked grumpy.\s\s\sOne day i think i said hello and asked how they were since I had seen then fairly frequently at that point. Her demeanor changed instantly and she smiled at me and was quite personable even if it was a very short conversation.\s\s\sYears passed and i learned which family she was from [small town] and found it sad to learn that her husband died a few years back. But considering it has been over 12 years now i still remember her smile and realizing then that just because someone *looks* grumpy doesn't mean that they are at all. I still think about her even though she should have been ""just another costumer"" at work.Well said. \s\sSometimes two strangers have to eat the same shit-sandwich that live had served them. There's a powerful bond there.I started going to my local YMCA about a year and half or so ago to make a healthy life move. I attempted to go 5-7 days a week. About 6 months into this a retiree started coming in 5-7 days a week right at the same time as me. Back then I would  joke about “the fat old man” in the gym with me even though I wasn’t in the best of shape either. But we both kept at it and a year later I got in great shape and so did he. No longer “the old fat man” but “the old fit man.” I remember after Christmas past I was happy that he had dope new workout gear. The rare occasion I didn’t see him I worried about him. We never spoke a word to each other. Occasionally we would both check the TV for the hockey scores. Sometimes I wonder if he noticed me too. Many times the weight room would be empty near closing and it was just us working away. I moved away from my city a month ago. I hope he’s doing well. He gave me the inspiration to go in even when I didn’t want to because I know he’d be there. If you’re out there thanks Mr. Stealyourgrandma. I’m coming for your title in a couple decades. I have a habit of sitting in my car to unwind a bit after work so I don't drive home all stressed out.  Its beginning to become a daily thing to see this one guy come up and buy a cigarette from me. The first few times I tried to just give him one but he wouldn't hear of it so he paid me for it and went on his way. Its been going on every other day or sometimes every day for a few weeks. I haven't seen him since Tuesday when we finally asked one another what our names are. I'm starting to worry about my 'friend'.  I'm sure he's ok and its only been a few days but its weird how a stranger can appear in your life and become a sort of far away friend if you will. \s\sThere was also a man that I always saw walking on the side of the road. He'd be dressed well with a suit and jacket no matter the weather. He was just always around until one day he wasn't. I didn't see him for months and I figured that he either got a car or moved away. But a few weeks ago I saw him again and it made me very happy to know he's still around and doing alright. I think of him as my walking friend.  Love your perspective on life. I think it’s the “I’m not alone on this” aspect. You don’t know them but you know them... it’s a great feelingwhy's he gotta be Indian?Good lord I thought this was r/indianpeoplefacebook and already braced myself for something awkwardI wanted to see how you look like to better paint a picture of the scene. I regret zooming in on your profile picture. Can’t be unseen *.*I need an AskReddit thread on familiar strangersFriend got a mirror? Tmobile doesn’t let me see imgur links...I ship itI have a commute buddy. He’s a big gay man who I stand next to. We have never said a word to each other but we’ll always smile at each other when we see each other around the small city where we work and we time our getting up and going to the train in the mornings. \s\sIt’s a weirdly nice part of my day. He doesn’t work on Mondays though which makes me feel a bit lonely but he always comes back. wait how do you know he is gay if you havent spoken?in todays reactionary climate im surprised this didnt turn into a #metoo moment. ..and that is how I met your mother...Sometimes it means the world just to be acknowledged...and that is how I met your mother...My mother worked in a hospital and she would take night shifts constantly. And on the mornings when she was leaving work she would take the same bus with the same driver and almost always the same passengers (due to the time they were few like 10 or so).\s\sOne day she was so tired she fell asleep at the bus stop (it's common in my city for bus stops to have benches). She woke up with the bus driver calling her and asking in a jovial manner ""aren't you gonna go home today?"" Mind you that in our country buses don't have to stop in a bus stop if no one signs to the driver that they want to board *that* specific bus. So the driver went out of his way for that. Also we don't live in a ""safe"" country so my mother being asleep at the bus stop would in the early morning hours be an easy target for a robber or a rapist. \s\sTo this day she says this had an impact in her life.Awww I hope they became commute buddies and started chatting in the mornings.  I always need that time in the morning on the bus to wake up before work.I have a habit of saying pleasantries like “Morning ☺️” and “have a good one 👋☺️” to people I see regularly. \s\sSometimes my country makes me feel like I’m weird for doing that but then I look at the rest of the world and realize it’s actually just showing common courtesy.\s\s\sI live in the USApretty common in the south at least in my experienceIt’s actually weird for the rest of the world and more common in the USA for this to happen would be surprised at how people pick up on things was the same when i used to get public transport before i could drive and would expect to see certain people on given days after so many months of riding public transport i noticed patterns of people coming and going and i would know their stops and almost felt like having a small insight into their day to day lives wither it felt intruding or not. Made sense to me... might be a load of non-since to othersOn my commute there’s this really nice guy who works most of the late nights at the train station by my work. If I made the train in time because NYCs digital signage just isn’t updated at 4am he gives me a big thumbs up. I was struggling to swipe my card one time and he just let me go and gave me his same cheery smile and thumbs up. Some day I’ll learn what his name is.This is so sweet I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. \sBest friend I ever had. \sWe still never talk sometimes.''- Ron SwansonGrowing up in Bangalore India - my schoolbus each day for 9 years approached a speedbump on our way home and as it climbed the bump I would look out my same window seat each day and see this juice man fixing juices and lassis (indian snack drink). We gave each other a thumbs up at some point and it became our thing for almost a decade. When I gradauted school one day I went and said hello. We had nothing to talk about it. I think we both felt weird hahah I've progressed to acquaintances with 2 of my 'commute buddies'. One of them I've now known for 6 years and we started off just seeing each other at the bus stop every morning. We don't see each other much now but he confided in me when his mother and partner both died. \s\sReminds me of this really lovely Brain Pickings [post](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/10/12/big-wolf-little-wolf/).This is where we are now in this world. The most simple human personal interaction triggers a surge of emotion...wow what have these phones and technology has done to us.When I end up traveling along side the same car for hours and finally one of us in departing I always wave... it just seems to make sense to me. When I was working one of my first jobs in my early 20s I used to have this fairly long commute including a 40 minute train journey. \s\sThere was this cute girl probably around my age who I always ended up sitting across from every day. For me at least it wasn't even like I was deliberately sitting across from her; it was just that the train was still fairly empty where I got on so I had a choice and I liked to sit in one particular carriage and seat for reasons of convenience when getting off and legroom comfort. She was definitely cute and I would sneak looks at her though.\s\sOne day after several months (so we definitely both recognised each other even if we'd never spoken) I happened to be looking out the window and caught her eye when she looked up as I was turning back round. She gave me this really sweet friendly big familiar smile. I immediately panicked stared down at my book with a blank expression and was careful to never make eye contact again until I moved jobs and started getting a different train.\s\sI'm in my mid 30s now. I'm thoroughly well adjusted. I have a partner who I live with love more than anything and want to spend my life with. But I still sometimes think of that moment cringe and wonder what might have happened if I'd smiled back.\s\sEdit: oh one more thing. I remember her looking sad as I frantically broke eye contact to stare at my book. Hahahaha. Jesus fuck 18-25 year old me.[deleted]I keep hoping the other person in all of these stories is on reddit and sees themselves in one of these stories. For yours more than any other.Trains ruleI have a sweet story for you:\s\sMy cousin used to take the 615am train to the city every morning. If you’ve never ridden the early morning commute train then you should know it’s pretty taboo to talk. My cousin however being the awesome woman she is who makes friends everywhere got a decent sized group of people who were in the same car everyday talking to one another. This went on for years but then fizzled our like things do due to people moving retiring changing jobs whatever. However they all became such good friends that they all cane out for her wedding a few weeks ago! Indian man? Like Cochise? Or was he an American? I always go to this little coffee/doughnut shop right next to where I do laundry to get coffee and change. I was behind on laundry one week and when I finally got around to doing it this sweet old Chinese lady behind the counter who I had hardly spoken to asked me where I had been. Now we have full conversations every week and she gives me life adviceThis is touching when strangers ask about you where you've been what you've been up to when your life breaks up the shared routine. It's kinda weird but life advice from strangers just feels so nice to hear.. more so than friends / family sometimes. Guess it's the lack of familiarity that can lead to unbiased and earnest urge to help. I used to stop at a petrol station a few times a week on my way to work. I never really spoke to the lady that worked there beyond ""hi thanks bye"" I fell pregnant and she'd notice my belly grow over the months. We still didn't really speak but when I was nearly due I went in and she had bought me so many baby clothes as a gift. I was blown away! I go to a thai restaraunt in my neighborhood and I usually order a pad thai and some curry. After 5 times of ordering the same thing i picked something different and the lady at the till made a comment about it.Is that profile pic Trump's face on a lady with a hot body and long blonde hair? Or does she just have a very unfortunate face? Share food next chance. Bring something to reciprocate the love you felt.\s\sThe little moments matter most. That is beyond adorable! I hope they exchange names and stories after this.I'm still living for this kind of event to take place in my life so I can feel wholesome and hopeful againYou dont have to. Go on a trip in the public transit once or go and help homeless people. There are good people everywhere and you just have to look for themI met one of my best friends on the bus they'd get on like three stops after me and then the same exact commute to the college we were going to. After a week of watching him and me follow the same route i just sat down next to him on the bus one morning and introduced myself. That was over ten years ago now xDI had a similar situation that ended in sadness. I used to work for a tech company that meant I had to spend some weeks in Sydney Australia sometimes. Whilst sitting in traffic one morning heading to the office I saw a gorgeous Mini Cooper in the martini colours (martini racing more specifically) and I sat beside him for a bit so I made sure to comment how much I loved his car. Then I happened to sit beside him in traffic many more times after that. Lots of times it was because we shared the same schedule but then after months away I would return to Sydney and sure enough there he was. I liked the guy! I especially liked his car being a symbol of his creativity. \sThen I was watching news and they were reporting on a bad car crash that was caused between 2 Supercars racing. I saw the images and caught in the crossfire of the 2 racing cars was his poor little Mini Cooper in its martini colours. I never saw him after that....:( nooooooI work with pretty good honest and presumably decent people. I don't speak to anyone unless I'm spoken to first or if they are in my way and I have to wait until they are finished in able to proceed with my job. (SMAll talk)\sI'm a bipolar introvert. I greatly appreciate when people go out of their way to greet me sometimes. Thank you. I'm not really that weird and I'm not gonna terror attack or any crazy shit. I just been through A lot and I am socially awkward because of trust issues and shit. Thank those who aren't prejudiced and closed minded. Brown-man here can verify we get very attached to strangers we see every day. I used to drive past a lifted purple dodge every morning on my way to work. After a few weeks they started giving a little wave and everything. Then I got a new job :( I've been out riding my motorcycle alone wound up behind a couple on a bike and ended up taking the long way home passing my original turn-off in order to ride ""with"" them longer. When I finally turned off the woman on the back turned around to wave bye to me and it made me feel so happy. Kinda like when you're driving for a long period and you stay with someone for mile after mile and they turn off. \s\sThen you're faced with more miles alone and your buddy is gone.I love it when due to different rest stops etc. you end up catching up with each other later in the day. It's like seeing an old friend again.Yes! On longer interstate trips I’ve rolled down the window and waved goodbye to a few ‘buddies’ while exiting the highway. Usually for those that I could tell wanted a buddy too; traveling the same speed leaving room when both changing lanes and overall respect while driving together. \s\sI like to think the farewell meant something to them too :)I hate being the person that has to turn off. Sometimes when I'm on a common commute and if I found someone to follow I try not to take shortcuts and keep following them. I'll feel a bit lonelier when I'm riding my bike in the snow and the other bicycle's tracks turn off down another road.I left Jacksonville FL one day on I-10 and just fell in with a line of 8-10 cars doing a little over 90mph.  I figured there was safety in numbers and followed along....for over 200 miles.  We passed two state troopers that I saw who didn't move.  When I turned off in Marianna after a couple of hours the two cars in front of me and the one behind me all waved.  It was just one of those passing magical little moments that makes life entertaining.[deleted]Omg I’m not the only one! It’s this special bond when you always pass the same people together because you’re both going the same speed and have the same highway behaviors. I always imagine I’m in that final scene of F&F whatever it was where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker go their separate ways [deleted]This past New Years I drove up from Anaheim to the Bay Area and I followed this suv for about 200miles on I-5. We both had our cruise control set around 90mph and when she turned off I realized it was an older woman in her 70’s. I thought for sure it was a younger person like myself but nope! Grams had a lead foot and I enjoyed her draft for a solid 2-3hrs. Basically me when I was in socal for college but from the Bay Area; that highway 5..  \s\sWhen someone gets pulled over I say silent thank you to the guy getting pulled over for taking one for the team lol.Absolutely this! There’s a particular instance that stands out for me. \s\sI was driving home to Tennessee from school in Alabama for my first Thanksgiving away. Probably made it 30 miles out of town when I realized I had a new best friend. Middle aged guy in a white VW we were both maintaining solid speed weaving our way in and out of traffic. He’d pull ahead at some points and I’d follow then I’d take the lead for a little while with him drafting behind. Never a race just Magic Man and El Diablo headed North. \s\sWe must’ve driven together for 125 miles or so before a split came up and I saw the blinker of friendship flash before me.  I knew it’d come eventually but homeboy and I were tight! As the fork hits I speed up to throw him a wave. Just before we’re parallel I see him looking for me too. We exchanged smiles and he gave me the best Robert Redford nod I’d ever received. \s\sIt’s been nearly a decade since that Thanksgiving weekend but I still think about my VW friend on any long car ride. Some say I’m just chasing that high that I’ll never have it again. The probably right but fuck them. They don’t know Todd (I hope that’s your name) like I do. \s\sI’ll see you again my friend. One moment that stuck with me was during a 2 hour drive following/leading a stranger. 3/4 of the way there I pulled into one of those rest stops and a few seconds later she pulled up in the parking spot beside me. We both took a restroom break came out at the same time but I drove off a bit quicker without saying anything. I drove a little slower and she caught up and slowed down to stay together again.\s\sI gave a friendly honk before leaving on my exit but I probably should've said hi earlier during the stop.\sI drove behind a guy for an hour and a half at about 4am. They were clearly tired as fuck going over the line from time to time and I would Flash my beams on em to try and keep them alert. I felt like I was giving my dog away when they took their exit. ""When I see you again""I once drove from chicago to milwaukee (1.5-2hr drive) following one car and the car got off the exit right before mine. It was kind of mind boggling. I was was on a road trip with some friends and I noticed a guy after a while. He just cruised behind me for 100 miles passing traffic behind me when I would. Then I started to pull off and he followed. While I was filling up the tank he ran by and yelled “Wait for me bro! I just need to pee.” We sadly separated 150-200ish miles later in Virginia since he was heading to Charlotte and us to Knoxville. Such a beautiful friendship. Got a 1500 mile drive coming up for the 4th of July and I hope I get some new travel buddies! I haven’t road trip for awhile and forgot all about it. This thread has got me jazzed up. Maybe I should get a whiteboard or travel buddy messaging.Yes!!!! I thought it was just me! 😭😭😭😭\s\sWhen I got my first car and drove off to college (crying because it was my first big drive alone and I was gonna miss my mama lol) I learned the power in that simple thing. So after some time of driving the road over the years I’d hang back for other people if I felt like they were trying to pair up for some miles especially at night. \s\sHumans can be awesome. I did a 15 hour drive in one shot from fredericton NB to toronto a few times.   One of those times a dude drove all the way to Montreal in front of me.  When he merged to exit we both rolled down our windows and waved.  It was a real moment. \s\s\sThat's like 9 or 10 hours together btw.I work the afternoon shift 3-11pm and going to work I usually see some of the same faces but it’s a university bus so each day is different but it’s when I go home on the 11:20 pm bus that’s when I see all my people they all have their little groups they get on the bus with at the stops near there works and I usually have headphones on so there’s no talking between me and then but Each time one of them isn’t on the bus ride to go home I do always wonder where they are and then sometimes I get worried they found a new job and won’t see them again even though we’ve never spoken it’s just the looks and head nods and the fact we all are feeling the same way long day of work and all we want to do is get home and relax that I think makes us all feel one in the same. Marry himwtf I clicked out of Facebook after reading that post and it's the first thing on my reddit frontpageThis is adorable can't wait to see this one reposted about one million times.Wait has it been posted before?! :(That profile picture phewI had a friend like this in college. We suddenly realized our classes would change at the ebbs of the semester and actually exchanged names and numbers and were friends for another three years till we graduated. \s\sOddly he was an Indian dude too.At first I read it as “as an Indian man” and was really confused by the profile pictureThere's a guy I see in my town all the time have done for years. We never speak and I don't even know his name but we always seem to cross paths. I went for a weekend in Wales once and was sat in a chippy eating a pie and dammit he was about 4 tables away from me seemingly enjoying his lunch too!! CrazySimilar experience here. I seem to always bump into this guy on campus we even had couple classes together. I think we were group members for a short time as well. But we rarely talked to each other. A year after I graduated I went to an apple store to try some Apple Watch bands (thinking about purchasing one) and he was there buying an Apple Watch! So I am in a wheelchair and to get to college or most other place I would take handi transit which basically a branch of the public transit dedicated to people will physical/mental disabilities and old people that you can book instead of waiting at bus stops.\s Now usually I would have the same driver(s) for a few days/weeks then it would change but it would still be the same ""roster"" of drivers and usually I get on say good morning pay the fare and sit and wait in the bus until my stop however there was one time where I didn't have this on driver for about 2 weeks and I was actually kinda worried about him but he came back and when I got one the bus in the morning he said ""hey haven't seen you in a while"" and then we started talking more and it was nice.do yourself a favor and zoom into the total babe in the profile pictureThat's so sweet I love it when stuff like that happens.  I have been ""friends"" with a few homeless people in my lifetime and I have always worried about them and missed them when they up and took off hoping for the very best for them.  One man was always especially nice and I would sit and talk with him for a few minutes if I was early for work I knew him for about four years.  I really enjoyed getting to know him he was an interesting and intelligent person.  I think it's important to try to make connections with people especially those who are different from you in some way.  It's common in India for commuter to make groups of commuter friends. They hold seats play card games chit chat etc. He's surely not a stranger to commuter friends if he's a first generation IndianYup we dobut mostly within our own gender. Reminds me of the time I used to take a train to work. I used to talk to most of the ladies who regularly share my route but rarely to guys. There was this one guy who got down at my stop and we just used to give each other an awkward smile occasionally. One day I took my kid along for bring kids to work day and this guy comes up to me n says ""I didn't know you were married"". I reminded him that we've never spoken before and he was like "" yeah but I feel like an old friend forgot to call me for her wedding "". It was weird and funny. We then started talking a little more till I changed jobs.TIL. This is actually useful to share—thanks. Otherwise her saying the other commuter is Indian seems like a gratuitous (at best) detail.Those kinda relationships are the best lolHope for curries?In my freshman year of high school I had study hall and the only other freshman in there was a kid who I knew but never was really friends with and we didn’t talk the entire year but it was just like this. What happened to saying hi to people in real life? Most people aren't out to get you. Say hello make a friend. Found the non-New Yorker/northeasterner. \s\sThat's unheard of here.  Europeans will back me up on this too.[deleted]I’m with you!  But I live in the south (US)You hear of these stories and some actually have the courage to talk and they end up getting married and having great lives. That's how one of my best friends met their spouse and they have 2 kids now and live in a house in the suburbs. I met my SO at a bus stop. Now living in a house in the suburbs. I don’t commute with anybody remotely attractive That's the story of my previous boss too. She and this guy would always catch the same shuttle going to work but not talk with each other at all. Until one day for some reason the shuttle was shut down. She and this guy decided to share a cab together and now they're married with a kid in high school. This kind of stuff can get really crazy.  Stories like this where perfect strangers never speak but one passes away... the other just sits wondering what happened.For ten years I would wave at this old man that lived at the end of my street. Mostly when we were taking our trash out to the curb (which happened with an odd degree of synchronicity over the years) or when I saw him mowing the lawn and I was walking my dog. I could have drawn a picture of the guy I knew his face so well but I never stopped to chat with him or even learned his name.\s\sOne day I noticed his trash can was still at the curb two days after trash pickup. I went down took it up to the side of the garage and then knocked on the door to check in on him. An old woman answered and I asked if the man was OK because it was the first time I'd seen the can left out at the curb in all the years I'd lived down the street. It turns out he'd passed away the week before and to say the least her routine was a little bit off. \s\sThat was years ago and I still walk down the street every week to take the trash out and mow the lawn in his stead. Over cups of tea with his wife and dinners at our home I've learned his name was Gerald he was a Korean War veteran and he took a lot of pride in his lawn and his flower garden. \s\sAnyways I guess the point is... take time now and then to meet your perfect strangers. Cheerful :/i wrote a slam poem style piece about this happening for an english assignment last year after realising that i hadn’t seen one of my usual bus companions for a while. i ran into them at school a few weeks later and they had just moved house but it really made me think about the people you see but never meet. When I was in highschool my teacher would tell us this story about once a month or so and it goes something like this:\s\sHe used to be very very fat until the age of 40+- when he decided to make a change and start working out (worked amazingly by the way just five years later he would run all the way from his house to school and back three days a week and the rest of the week he would commute on a bicycle his house was 27 kilometers from school) any way after a few years of weightloss he started swimming in the mornings it was only him and people who were in their early seventies or older and there was one regular woman there no one liked she was really crabby and sny no one really went near her but he said ""I'm gonna make her my friend!"" So he sinoly started saying good morning to her every day he saw her and even though she always snubbed him he never stopped until he had a really bad day and forgot to approach her she noticed and approached him and asked him if everything is ok he opened up to her and then she opened up to him he never told us what she said to keep her privacy but they apparently became very close friends after that!\s\sJust goes to show no one is ever really lost and sometimes all it takes is a little warm human contact.Is no one going to talk about the twitter picture?This is such a tiny thing but it really hits me deep 😓 much love to ya brothaIs it just me or her profile picture is Trump photoshopped on a busty lady?it's trump on a kardashian. a tardashian if you will.[deleted][Foxy and Friends](https://i.imgur.com/50sh9I5.png)/r/ConfusedBoners Haha this is greatI love these stories! I run on a popular path in town and have regulars that always make the run perfect when I see them and a little sad when I don’t: electric skateboard guy cute old couple woman carrying aluminum bat Zumba break lady. \s\sPrevious posters are right - you notice more when they’re NOT there. And makes you hope maybe you’re a character in someone’s day too.This reminds me of my grandfather actually. He’s from cambodia so his English is terrible but he and his neighbor in America shared a very special friendship. A while back my grandfather took a trip to Cambodia and when he came back and I paid a visit his neighbor’s wife was telling me about how he missed him despite the language barrier and he was kinda down. It was really sweet to hear. And when he came back they got back to chilling on their front porch enjoying the weather like old people do. I feel the same way about my lunchtime gym bros that I see every day and occasionally nod to but they keep me motivated because I don't want to not show up. I know they'll be there getting in their mini workout without me.I have a very similar story that happened last night. I have a Korean-Canadian parking neighbour at my building and there is a bit of a language barrier so we never really said much to each other. Seems like a normal dude never any issues with him just never had a reason to talk to him. Last night I came home and someone was parked in my spot with their car on (probably waiting for someone) and my parking neighbour was out at their window telling them to move its not their spot. I pulled up as they were pulling away and after i thanked him he said that he thought i got a new car but when he saw it wasnt me he asked them to move. \s\sSuch a small gesture but it really meant a lot to me. Its kind of unexplainable but I love the unspoken connections formed with people. Same thing when youre driving on the highway with the same group of cars for a while\s\sEdit: fixed some grammar and changed Korean to Korean-Canadianyay to Korean man a class act Anybody save that post from a few months back where that Indian guy always put his jacket etc on the seat next to him in class and it was told from the p.o.v. of some other guy in the class?\s\s7:20 AM A train at 17tth there are people in that train that saw me going to high school for 4 years and I never talked to them. The I went away to college and after 4 more years I came back to NYC and I happened to take the same train to work...  A few people still took the same train. Well judging by the user's avatar of ""Trump head with red cap photoshopped into a busty blonde in a sports bra"" yeah I'm sure the other dude would definitely notice someone like that on the subway[deleted]I work from home.... i would like to believe some one has been lonely their entire life Ive never seen his show (too young and Australian) but he seems like the best person I don’t know from what I’ve seen on here This man is a beautiful soulWhy am I crying Mr. Rogers why my childhood. Love that guyThe smile on his face..... Just pure. Yea you can tell his reaction to seeing the man onstage was absolute pure and genuine happiness ❤️ that melted my heart into a puddle. \sI only ever watched him daily when I was kid sure do miss him and his show. Love how Mr. Rogers just jumps on stage without using stairs or a side entrance. I think this may be from the same awards show as his moment of silence speech that he did so that everyone in Hollywood would shut up for just 10 seconds.I’m actually surprised he remember the kid after all those years. Mister Rogers was a pure soul that we did not deserve but needed. I cannot say how happy I am to have come across this this morning. Thank you! Hello! What a nice gif! I hope everyone is having an excellent day. Please be sure to share it with us at  /r/wholesomegifs if it's not already there! We'd love to see you there as well.\s\s[Thanks!

I'm willing to bet Mr Rogers remembered his name. He reacted like there was no one else in the room. He got up there without hesitation and spoke to him in a personal way aside from using the microphone. That was truly wholesomeIt’s too early to be tugging at my heart strings like this. He was a great actor and an even better parent.Him and Martin Short are just the best who’ve gone through the worstWhat happened to Martin Short?An Rick Moranis was the funniest guy around in the 90s along with John Candy Dan Akroyd Bill Murray. The greats.John Candy has very good reason for not acting anymore as well.Fun fact his bday is Wednesday.These people are great. They give me hope that there is still some good in the world.Hello!

\sAKA Bob McKenzie!I love him! When I first heard his story I began to cry almost uncontrollably.  Such a fundamentally good and decent person.  We need more like him.[deleted]I must be too young because I legitimately don’t know who Rick Moranis is. I thought this was a really young Mike Meyers.\s\sBut from the one fact this post taught me about him he seems like a really stand up dude!I want to see him do Comedians in Cars Getting CoffeeAha! I have often wondered what happened to him. TIL! \s\sHe was a great actor such a warmth and familiarity to his characters.I think we all would do this if we were as he was financially able to quit our jobs\s[deleted]TIL: you can't simultaneously be an actor and a single parent or else you're setting a bad example. Oh man I had heard about his wife and why he quit but I didnt know she passed on. How terrible i really hope hes since been able to cope and live a healthy life. Havent really heard of him since so hey hes most likely doing okay i hope! I'm a huge theatre kid and Little Shop of Horrors will always be my favorite musical. I loved Rick Moranis as Seymour I think he'll always be my favorite and I have so many special memories associated with that movie thanks to him. His kids are grown by now so there's a reason he's not back. Same guy in everything. And the movie Little Giants with Ed O'neil""I'd kiss you but I've got puke breath eh?""\s\s(Strange Brew)He lives in my town apparently.  My friends work at the grocery store he frequentsHoney I raised the kidsWhat part of this is wholesome? Or really a meme? Im sorry but this is just a TIL really. A sad one at that.PSA: check out his music album The Agoraphobic Cowboy. It's some of best wordplay (and catchy folk songs) you've ever heard. He's the best.Bloody loved little giants as a kid. Top guy.Wouldn't it be nice if every parent that's experienced tragedy could quit their job to take care of their kids full time. Nothing heroic about this. Ask me how I know. [deleted]Such..warm fuzzy feelings...His country album is amazing.Unfortunately he lives on the upper west side in Manhattan and looks a bit like a homeless person now. I was a bit heart broken by it. He also looks like he’s a bit out of it as he mumbles to himself. Not being mean or making it up it’s him and I wish things ended better for him. \s\sSo the point of the topic may not be ideal before you learn what actually happen to them.Man those kids are grown. Whassup with the gb reboot?[deleted]Ya but Moranis was bullied extensively in that 90s movie with Dan Arnold....Isn't he coming back though? I remember reading about it and I was very happy.Probably about 2% of humanity do something like thisMost people would still have bills to worry about.  That’s not to take anything away from his decision.  Many people in his position would keep raking in the dough while hiring a nanny or something.  I’m just saying his success put him in a position where he was able to make that decision for his family while many people nearly aren’t nearly successful enough to quit their jobs to raise their kids.Well he quit 18 years after she died but he's still great He didn't ""quit Hollywood."" He took a break after a busy year and a personal tragedy and then it turned into a longer break. He still did voice acting and commercials. He put out a comedy album. He still wrote. He was extremely typecast at that point and he got bored with the roles he was offered and he could afford to turn them down.\s\sMaybe I'm wrong but whenever I see someone share this story it comes with a lot of implied judgment. Would he really be less of an ""example for humanity"" if he'd continued acting in major comedy movies because he still really enjoyed it and felt confident he could raise his kids correctly at the same time? I don't think so. I get the feeling people who like this meme think otherwise.He wouldn't have been a bad guy or anything but at the same time he wouldn't have made what many would consider a substantial sacrifice either. Almost everyone wants fame and riches. Not saying he's poor and unknown now but he did knowingly take a significant blow to both so he could spend more time with his kids.Patton Oswalt took some time off after his wife passed to spend time with his daughter and he's doing stuff again. I don't think anyone thinks less of him.\s\sSo i agree. I think we get so caught up in wanting to lable people as amazing or terrible that we dont actually pay attention to what the person did.I like the meme although I didn't know the full story.  For me ""an example for humanity"" doesn't mean ""someone who does things literally the only correct way"" it just means that somebody has handled themselves in a commendable way.  I have a lot of examples I look up to but most of them would handle any given situation in very different ways.He just finally realized time is short.I definitely agree with you.  Didn’t he start doing music after this? Wikipedia says his wife died in 1991 and his hiatus began in 1997. Less wholesome sounding with this known. [deleted]Rick Moranis really did seem like a great guy. I absolutely loved him in Little Shop of Horrors.It still would have been fun if he got a cameo in the new ghostbusters movie. Setting an example?   \s\sMost people need to keep working because they haven't made millions in Hollywood already.   \s\sIt's not an example it's an (earned) privilege.It's a positive example of how to recognize the privilege and wealth you have and spend more time on family than pursuing millions more from movies.+1 for (earned)He also aged really well. He's 64 and maybe looks 50 - 55.Wouldn't have recognized him if I wasn't specifically searching for images of old him. So did what most any dad would do? He’s lucky he had the financial means to do so. Don’t get me wrong it’s great but it isn’t groundbreaking. I like him in A Series of Unfortunate Events.He's the coach of the Little Giants. Even though he didn't think of the play he decided to run the annexation of Puerto Rico to win the big game.I was working at Fairway Market in NYC on Broadway. I recognized him helped him decide on a multivitamin and told him that I liked his country music. He was politely grateful very nice. I think he could've still been involved in Hollywood and still be a good father. He just did what he thinks would be best for him and I respect him for that. However I feel like this is chastises single parents involved in Hollywood.So that's where he went? Well what a great man. He's done a decent amount of voice acting so I wouldn't really say he ""quit hollywood"" more like semi-retired.In loveI hope he and his family are doing well these days.  Geez was just this morning wondering what happened to himHope Rick can participate in the Netflix Scorsese special on SCTV.  Who is he?Rick Moranis. Before her death he had prominent roles in Ghostbusters Honey I Shrunk the Kids Spaceballs and several other 80’s films. Dark Helmet.Fuck now I feel old thanksDid you ever hear the tragedy of Dark Helmet the ludicrous?I think thats the guy from Austin PowerHoney I'll be raising the kids.I think he also got a bit bored of films and a bit old for it (his screen persona) tbh. I think he [does a bit of music now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OeCacs5oqM) and just prefers the quiet life. His kids must be grown up. Really? Have we gotten to the point where someone who is rich enough to decide not to work is heralded as “an example for humanity” because he chose to raise his kids after his wife died... What’s the alternative make them live on the streets? Breaking news father looks after his own kids! Nothing against the guy or the tough situation I just don’t get why he’s made to look like a hero for raising his own fucking children.Isn't he coming back though? I remember reading about it and I was very happy.honey I raised the kidsBut seriously how old are his kids? They've got to be in their 30s by now. Get back to movies. Underrated surprisingly touching and accurate comment.I'm not crying my face was wet alreadyI only read about this a few months ago. Such a sweet guy and comic genius.I was just thinking about what happened to himCuz when a man quits his job to raise his kids it's a notable sacrifice. When a woman does it it's just expected and she'll be shamed if she doesn't put her kids first.Yeah equality means anyone can do the job if they are passionate about the task. It's not owned by anyone.[I miss Moranis...](https://youtu.be/J-7e70uNq5o)When my best friend was about 7 she saw him on a ferry and asked him for an autograph and he told her he doesn’t “do” autographs. She’s hated him ever since 🤣When I was really little (I don’t remember how little exactly) I invited him to my birthday party. Sent him a card and everything. My mom tried to tell me not to get my hopes up but I totally did. He didn’t come. I was crushed. Crushed I say!I hate memes but I can get behind thisI'M SO FUCKING HAPPY TO BE THE FUCK HERE WITH YOU BEAUTIFUL FUCKING PEOPLE! FUCK! I'M HAPPY! I hate unnecessary swearing. But to each their own. [removed]I worry this is a slippery slope.  Now every other post will involve it.I need more memes like this. Where do i find more saucy animal memes?That bunny must be high afr/me_irl\s\sEDIT: lol When people downvote you just because you mentioned another subreddit...Oh cool a trash subThis is me when I have my first cup of coffee on an empty stomach.Today at work I was scrolling Reddit but had to pee so when I got to this comic I was like ""ok I'll leave it here just a bunny comic nothing weird"" so I got up and went to the bathroom. When I returned and read this I realized this wasn't just a cute normal bunny comic and hope no one read this passing by. I imagined the bunny had a really deep voice whilst saying thisMineI read that in Neegan's voice.Life is good.

Look around bro look at life!I don't like Boat but I wish someone talked to me like he talked to Kyle at the beginning of that song every once in a while :(I have a friend that used to live in a kind of purpose fit shed in the garden when he lived with his parents. His family had a large male rabbit that would run around the garden all day and just do normal rabbit things except this one was large enough and horny enough to have sex with any of the local cats that wandered into the garden. He said it one of the weirdest things he's ever seen just this bunny holding down the cat in the middle of his garden and fucking it. Didn't know they had that side past the cuteness I love this!  It reminds me of a client no one ever wanted to talk to because he cursed so much. As a result I ""inherited"" him and he turned out to be the most cooperative positive person I ever met.  Personally I am not offended by cursing so I really enjoyed working with him especially when ""the motherfucking sun was shining making it a goddamn beautiful day.""  :)Wtf Judy.Makes me miss the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Sid was a fucking badass. I was sort of hoping he'd be eating the flower in the last frame :)I like the cursing bunny.Omg so awesome! Is it possible to make an iphone 7 wallpaper of this comic? *cool swearing makes anything seem chill and able to be appreciated*That's exactly how I react when a day is just that good. I almost get a righteous anger going.That rabbit has a foul mouth. Based on my yard buns the last panel should be ""I'm gonna fucking eat it and it's gonna be fucking delicious.""

Sometimes I see people get excited over really mundane things like they're intoxicated with an inexplicable glee for just existing in general which is cool man y'know you do you but I dunno to me it seems a little disingenuous. I think the key to happiness is learning how to deal with negative emotions in a responsible manner recognizing and reveling in the goodness of people and pursuing things you find meaningful while accepting and respecting your own limitations.\s\sBut I dunno if it's a nice day and I see a pretty flower I can't really feel much except utter neutrality to it. Y'all seem like happy fellows am I missing some other key component to enjoying life? Does everything have to be mentally engaging in some way to elicit joy or is this rabbit onto something?I had such a beautiful fucking day thanks to this glorious ass rabbit.In my head the rabbit is voiced by Gordon Ramsay.TIL this sub accepts swearing.

I looked up the scene the second I finished reading the comic I'm not sure if it's alright to link to it on here though.\s\sedit: I don't do words good.I like how they're both in space floating towards the Sun. [removed]I gained this perspective from LSD and never lost it.  [removed][removed]Have always had rabbits they would absolutely cuss if the could speak.  If you're cooking in the kitchen and you ignore their thump demands expect a bite in the foot.  Offer them to take a bite out of a carrot they won't they'll take a giant nom hold on it and try ripping it out of your hand so they can run away with it and have it all to themselves.  I love it when wholesome memes have swearing in them it just makes it more entertaining for me.If I saw that I'd call my dealer and say ""shit just got wholesome""Shit got Kosher...The idea of teensy little bunnies having a foul mouth pleases me.I have a pet bunny. Before I got him I always pictured rabbits as demure shy and skittish. But it turns out that's not accurate. Or at least not for my bunny. He's extremely feisty and opinionated. He would absolutely curse if he could.Surprises make life exciting. Foul-mouthed bunnies count!Whenever my dog chases bunnies in the park I assume they are saying ""fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck!""It reminds me of recurring puppet Sid on Craig Ferguson.Makes me think of Yelling Bird from Questionable Content. Except cuter in this case and much less threatening.When my family narrates animals this is how we do it.You should read the graphic novel called The Unwritten. There's a plot thread that involves exactly that (as a whole it's an excellent series as well). Quite quite. I used to have two teensy fluffy bunnies. It would've warmed my heart to hear them talk like this.I need this bunny.I'm glad to see I'm not alone in that :)https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lck4Rdm0h_gsadWatershit DownI heard from a bear once that rabbits have the worst mouth.

I felt I had to do right by him and give him and his buddies a small space they could eat from. And by small I mean [big](http://imgur.com/7ufAPPB.jpg). \sMaybe too big... But I'll cut àbout 1/2 down and let them feast. The rabbit in this comic kinda reminded me of him. Plus a few months ago I think I nearly ran m""my"" rabbit over... Seems like the same guy but what do I know.Bunny having a good day best not tell him he is starring in Watership Down.Lol swearsThis is exactly how Negan talks 😂[removed]Look at that shit! A fucking swearing hop pupper!One of my favourite wholesome memes. /u/jh55305I like the attention to detail on the flowers. I can tell they are violets. This artist uses references :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGyQmH9NZcwHow do I get this on a shirtGood shit.Mmmmm right there Motherfucking breadcrumbsDas good shit*Rabbit eats flower. \s\sThat was fucking good tasting flower. The rabbit we had when we were kids fucking loved flowers but mostly because she ate any we'd put within her reach.I laughed out loud at work.\s\sNo regrets.No regrets mate! Hahaha I LOL'd so hard at this!This cartoon epitomizes how it felt to be in the Boston area today. After a full week of 40-50 degree weather we launched into spring with a solid 85 degree day.https://i.imgur.com/A00cwGw.pngI personally feel this comic doesn't belong here due to using excessive swearing in addition to more than one instance of the F-word. \s\sBut apparently my opinion of what's wholesome differs from the majority.This legit how im feelin td😂If bunnies spoke like AustraliansPlease post to r/rabbits!I like aggressive wholesome memesI was looking out the window today and someone commented on how awful the weather was. My only thought was how green the grey of London made the trees look and how pretty is was. I enjoyed that moment along with many others this day. Fuck yes.My friend just texted me this and said it reminded him of me and I just wanted to let everyone know that there's no better feeling than being the person someone thinks of when they see something sweet :)Cougar out of nowhere "" oh fuck this shit im out of here""This put a smile on my face. [removed]Me on acid. Proud of youThat bunny has a foul mouth but a great attitude.Wow thanks everyone! Quick links to my [website](http://falseknees.com/252.html) and my [store](http://falseknees.tictail.com/) for anyone interested!\s\sAnd have a great fucking day!Your comics are the best part of my day!Holy shit! I fucking love you! You're my new favourite comic artist. I look forward to your content daily!I want to say that I appreciate that your prints are very fairly priced. It's fucking nice!This should be higher! Credit is always needed for awesome artists like you.why isnt this gilded yet.LMAO 😂😂😂😂 SAY FUCK AGAIN XDOh from the creator of the goose with a goose for a brain!  \s\sI love the absurdity of such well drawn birds and their dumbass conversations.  Somehow your work captures the feeling of this city very well. Can't put my finger on it.Fuck Yeah.Thank youSaved upvoted. Good shit. [removed]Mr. Rabbit started to read the Urban DictionaryWho is Seth Rich But bunnies never just relax and enjoy the day they're always on high alert because a predator could pop up at any moment.What a mouth on that bunny. Growing up would been more fun if that was Bugs Bunny was more like that :) I was having a LONG day today...thank you I needed this. \sThen water ship  down happens lolWatership Down is one of the most wholesome novels of all time. OF ALL TIME.\s\sThe cartoon was an abomination though.this meme is wholesome AFThis made my day and I needed it! Worth the $3.99 😁I think this is fucking awesome. I swear too much that it caused me to take a while to understand this\s\s...welp shit Ha this is Great.I needed thisI could learn something from this rabbit! [removed][removed]I like this meme. I'll. Keep this meme for future needs. Shrooms_IRLThis reminds me of Watership Down. The movie about a bunch of rabbits that just want to get a dope spot when then find the spot then they need to get some bitches. Problem is they roll up to these fine honies  and they be fucking this OG. So they squad up and attack in a full on war to get them hoes back their spot to fuck.\s\sGreat movieSaving this to look at during a down in the dumps day! Love positive swearing. I wish I was happyIs this about me? I walked to the bus stop yesterday to get my kids after school and I took 13 pictures of flowers and trees. I should mention the bus stop is at the end of my driveway.my bust stop brings all the girls to the yardWhen is it ever a great day to be alive? :(( Jk lovin' lifeThis comic describes my fucking excellent day. Hell yeah.I'm tripping outside and this made me tear up and then realize I need to stop looking at my phone and enjoy the day![removed]Sorry to be unwholesome but at first I read this as an existentialist comic about the emptiness and meaninglessness of life on Earth. All the rabbit has to do in life is stare at flowers and it just seems kinda empty like there's got to be more to life than that. I hope anyone who happens to scroll down enough to read this believes me when I say that's actually how I read this comic I'm not just bullshitting an alternative viewpoint to be contrarian. Life is hard. Maybe I need to get out more.That's some good shit right here some good fucking wholesome shit[Source here at falseknees.com](http://falseknees.com/252.html)I needed this this morning thanks this sub for being consistently awesome and wholesome :) Just wanted to say that the artist's name is Joshua or False Knees and he's from Kitchener Canada!

Own two rabbits can confirm. They are little  munchmachines. Well it's clearly wild iris which is a common yard weed.  The home owner is probably happy about it.THE CIIIIIIRCCLE OF LIFE!!!!And it was goodMmm cowslip...And then a fox ate the bunnyThat's only cus it's a rabbit in spring.This actually made me feel better Today was a good day!Wish I was feeling it as much as this bunny's feeling it todayThis reminds me of Deb from Dexter.I feel like that today! Beautiful sunny day ☀️🌞I just want to remind you guys that swearing is allowed on this subreddit as long as it is not directed in a mean way or as a slur. We know that the majority of users here are adults and we believe that we should be able to express ourselves in any (non bigoted) way we want. :)\s\s[More info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5qd45d/swearing_and_wholesome_memes/)\s\sAlso if you enjoyed this post check out /r/wholesomecomics![deleted]Awesome :D that's good to know sometimes fuck is just the best word for the sentence :PThat's fucking great this fucking sub is pretty fucking dope and I guess I'm fucking saying fucking a little too fucking often.

There are plenty of kids that browse reddit. I'm not trying to argue but...  \s>We still do not allow any kind of NSFW content excessive swearing or swearing in a negative way.  \s\sIt says ""We still don't allow excessive swearing"" which is clearly the freaking joke of the comic. On the other hand I enjoyed the comic and I don't feel offended at all by it I'm just saying that you're not following the rules by the book.   \s  \sEdit: I accidentally quoted everything. One year and still don't know how to reddit... Oops.[removed]Bigotry is the fucking worst. Thanks for being awesome mods!! ❤️Even this comment is wholesome.

This subreddit is definitely such a wonderful idea and place. The idea of just being positive kind and compassionate is something that I feel is really important especially in today's day and age. After a rough day this subreddit really helps destress and just look at things more positively. Thanks to all the mods and everyone who keeps the good vibes going!Thanks u/snomann it is people like you who make the difference here.  Hope your days get a little less rough and a little more smoothe :)Don't ever mod another subreddit. It will break you. This place is full of nice people.

I drink hard I do drugs and I'm not very discriminating when it comes to sexual partners. But I really love your sub. This probably isn't the sort of comment that pops up on here. And you should probably delete it since I'm far from wholesome. But when I'm really feeling bad I hit up this sub. It always makes me feel better.

Isn't that a cool way to think about it?!This annoys me because a new game+ is when you start the game over again from the beginning except you've got a bunch of levels and items you had at the end of the game. It would be the equivalent to being reincarnated.\s\sHer idea for the shirt should have said something like ""Next level"" or implied a new chapter or stage of the game.HARD MODEWhat about ""Player 2 just joined"" \sNot to take away from what you did I like it a lot.Did anyone else think they added a double chin? I would totally buy thus shirt anyone have a way to make it Ready player... three?Player 2 has joined the game Would have gone with “Press Start to Join”Player 2 has joined the game.My wife doesn't play games with me but she supports my gaming. She bought me the Nintendo Labo kit for father's day. Me and my littlest spent 2 hours together building and playing with the kits. Then we played squads on Fortnite and we got our first win together with my middle son. It was a good father's day.If she didn't improve your life and make you wanna be better then she isn't the right person for you New Game+ is normally substantially more difficult but people tend to only go into it if it is something they truly enjoySounds like marriage to me. It takes a lot of work and it's difficult but it's worth the effort. [deleted]IMO its almost certainly easier since you start with a full inventory and build already started instead of starting from scratch. Its just the enemies will have more health. At least thats the way it is with most games. I let my husband play my NG+ for Persona 5. We're having a lot of fun getting all the things I missed the first time. Following that logic New Game+2 must be when you have your first kid.For me when I first read it 'game' was interpreted as like a player and the game of getting girls so 'game over'. And with that interpretation the 'new game' seems like both the groom and wife are thinking about affairs while smiling lolAnd half of them quit.This is perfect. 👍There are two different types of ""New Game+"" in games that I'm aware of. They're both united in that you unlock them by beating the game normally but otherwise they're quite different. There's the replay that's much harder than the first like you mentioned but I think substantially more common is the one where you play again but keep your items level powers etc from the previous playthrough.Wow that was pretty deep and applies very well. Start of a wonderful wedding speech for these people lolI think the front should be the original picture with game over then the back have the wife pregnant with new game plus. But add smiles to both sides. Brilliant!  Captures how I felt about it.  :)It's a bit long-winded but could also have ""Player 2 has entered the match""\s\sThat's definitely my reality wifey and I play together all the time.  ...we play computer games together as well.  Fnar.Seems more applicable to a remarriage lolThe smile seem abit creepy without eyes like they got something to hide other then that pretty coolGood. I'm really happy they made this! Marriage is a great thing! :) I hope the whole ""my wife is terrible"" thing becomes less common.If you think marriage is game over you’re marrying the wrong person. Well the dating game is over and most people who have been in it for a while would say thats a good thing.I honestly think most people in this thread are just interpreting the shirt the wrong way. Dating is often metaphorically referred to as a game and when you finally meet the right person you’ve won the game and it’s game over. Pretty sure how I met your mother did a bit on this I'd buy the shit out of that tshirt. I always thought the game over shirts were in really poor taste bc I love my wife and she's the best part of my life it's not game over it's a new chapter. That is awesome.You’ve made a joke into a serious attention seeking image Should have said ""enter player 2"" but what do I knowNew game+I'm sure it wasn't the intention of the original shirt but beating some older games still gives you a Game Over screen since your game is still over it's just not from losing.\s\sThat said the new shirt is better and comes across a lot easier.Does this game have the replay value of Skyrim on PC or a linear plot driven JRPG? \s\sAnswer is strangely important for future life decisions...I mean he’s not wrong New Game + is hard mode.He gave them double chinsI like the little smiles on the new version!Or are they double chins?Is this an actual shirt? Because I will so get one after I marry my girl. (The fixed one obviously)I'm curious if this is *confirmed* to be a bad thing to say? Classic games would say Game Over when you win after all. Such as Mega Man. \s\sMaybe optimistic of me but could that have been the original intent? That being said I like the redo. 'New Chapter' or '2P Mode' would've worked too.And the new game has more micro-transactions than you'd ever believe.not all heroes wear capes. So is it starting a new game with perks right off the bat ??Maybe it's game over because you finished the dating game and won. No misogyny. Always misogyny.u/pineapplets❤️Pffft that means it's a second marriage*gets pregnant*\sExpansion pack!It didn't need the creepy ass smile though Make one with a baby that says “+1 life”Could've put the caption- ""Multiplayer Mode"". Love the wholesome version though.LEVEL TWO!\sI always thought that shirt meant the dating game was over because you finally found your player 2.I took it as a new 2nd marriage  because sometimes the 1st time doesnt work out but it doesnt mean you dont give up on love.You go back to the title screen and make a new save fileYou could also have put ‘player 2 has joined the game’ but that’s long I guess I love how you changed that old outdated notion of marriage being a prison into something that should be cherished.\s\s*Till death do us part*##A NEW PLAYER HAS JOINED YOUR PARTYteamkilling is enabled though so... know who you're playing with!More like ""Player 2 has entered!""Ohh they're smiling! I should really read the text first I just thought new game plus was them with double chinsUnpopular opinion: I’m a bit afraid of marriage not because I’m a mean person but I just feel like im unworthy and I don’t want to repeat the same mistakes my father and step father make especially being abusive. Just try your best. Don’t force yourself to miss out on good things in life because of your fathers’ mistakes. Nothing about their abuse makes you unworthy of love or marriage.That's not what NG+ is in any game. Press start player 2Its so sad that society tells men that marriage is the end of having fun. Its starting a new adventure with someone you love!Am I the only one that thought ""game over"" was divorce and ""new game"" was getting remarried? \s\sI'm going to hell aren't I? The female looks like she's crossing her arms in the left and has her hands clasped in joy on the right.  It's because she's smiling in the second panel.  Facial expressions change the way we perceive gestures.  New Game plus is such a beautiful way to think of itAlso works as an ad for swingers.I love some good couch co-opCan you play the new game on solo ? My GF are always look for good Couch Co-Op games!\s\sI recommend: Super Mario 3D World for WiiU - its amazing and 4 players can play super newbie friendly\s\sAlso: Trine 2 - up to 3 players I think and very fun puzzle game. Beautiful too.\s\sAny other recommendations super welcome!!!Cow Chop 🐮 🔪Doesn’t new game + imply you’ve played it before? Sooo... is this shirt for people’s 2nd marriage?I want one! LolCan't wait for the Parenting DLC.\s\s(It's been loading for 9 months)Player two: press A to join""i only have three wives left""To those of you that don't know what a new game plus is you basically start the story over but keep all of your unlocks.Together it makes a great 2nd marriage shirtYou keep most of your old stuff on the new play through and find amazing secrets you never noticed before.So it's like those RPG franchises on Nintendo that in sequels allow you to grab your save file and inventory from the previous game from your SD card and keep going from where you left off and go straight to the new content?\s\s^r/outsideWow!! Hella creative! Smiley faces!I love it!! And I want a shirt like this <3Except that it’s more like the original and new game + is DLC I refuse to pay forI love this1 upShould be 'player two has entered the game'Clearly it should read player 2 joined the game... Ts I genuinely wasnt much of a gamer before i fell in love with my husband. Coming up on 10 years and i now play video games with him almost daily in some way :'> i got into them to understand him more share part of something he loved so much and have something more we could do together without having to ""go out"" and spend bunches of money. Through games we've lived many more lives through them and grown a lot through co-oping some hard ass games together (damn you dark souls).\sThank you op for making this you're a badass. Carry on <3.\sAlso pardon my bad grammar poor phone skizells. ;]Recently married can confirm. The game's so much better with two players.   \sThe text on the t-shirt is way better tooOr ""Player 2 has entered the game""The game could have been them before the marriage and then once they got married that’s game over. I know it probably wasn’t but it’s better than the alternative. That *new game+* instantly reminded me of undertale. PLAYER 2 HAS ENTERED THE GAMEOr maybe like ""New Player has joined game"" New game +\s\s All the experience and levels but you only take half your inventory forwardI just assumed the new game plus was a second marriage. When they have a baby. ""Extra Life""This is actually just plain nice.Player 2 added“Player 2 has joined the game”Ready Player OneThis is so cutePlayer 2 press startI saw this after my fiancé broke up with me and I cried because that’s what I thought I was going to have Aww man I’m sorry :/I feel like it should probably be game over - you win.  I always took the game over thing as the ""dating game"" being over. Why not ""player 2 joined the game""?Make that look good on a shirtThey both now have double chins?Shouldn't it say 1up? AwwwwActually like that better lol Is there anywhere to actually buy this? I'm literally getting married in a month (and 3 days) and I would love to give him this!Good luck on the marriage!The original font is Blippo if you want to get even more accurate with the remake. The smiles are a great touch though :)I never understood shirts like this. If you don't love your wife why did you marry her? No one forced you to! It's okay for men to say they love their wives! You don't have to call her your ball and chain!Love is a beautiful thing marriage is not. That's how I see it at least “That means new game plus bitches”So second marriage? We all the way live babywatch out for the DLC...\s\s50k for a dog\s\s350k per child\s\s350k for your own house\s\s\s\sThey say you start to see some weird shit when you get to NG+7Shouldn’t new game+ have a child involved?I used to have the mindset of the picture on the left. Now after meeting this one girly I now have the mindset of the picture on the right. \sThis is truly cute as fuckThey missed the perfect oppurtunity for “player 2 joining game”At my dad's fourth wedding after the new wife said ""I do"" he took off his jacket and shirt to reveal the ""Game Over"" shirt. With each marriage my dad becomes an even cringier PoS. It's the world's worst super power. That seems like that would hurt her feelings. :(Did people laugh? Why did he think this was cool to do at this own wedding? I totally understand making a joke about matrimony and tying the knot but it should be light-hearted and never upstage the actual event that event being joining your life with someone else's for the foreseeable future.I would've preferred 'enter player two'I just wish I could play this game because I can't seem to even make it past the start screen.... I think my copy is bugged or something.Awwwwwwwwww. So sweet[deleted]I’d definitely buy the NG+ version.She looks like a total bitch Dark Souls fashbacksPlayer 2 press “I Do” to enter gameSo wholesome he even pointed out what the original was despite it being so obvious having explained what it was. :)I wish I could give you more upvotes. You're the very best human.Subsequent matching onsie- player 3 has entered the game.I hope player 3 8s a baby and not a mistressSo its a shotgun wedding? She's prego then.It's great how the change in caption makes the it look like the bride on the left had her arms crossed angrily and on the right she is clapping with joyBarfMore like ""level up"".Marriage:  I bet you half my shit you won’t leave me before I dieI love this so much but the smile seems somewhat out of place Made the font better tooPlayer 2 has entered the gameI find the male stereotype of dreading marriage and disliking their wife extremely cringey and frustrating. It's insulting to imply that men can't hack long-term relationships aren't equally as committed or dedicated to making compromises that come with relationships.I like this a lot! The original always pissed me off.The qIt always upsets my mum when people act like marriage is the death of life. She never got to marry her partner of 18 years as it was still illegal until a year after she died.That sucks. I'm sorry about your mom.Please let your mom know that a random internet stranger thinks her love for her partner was just as valid as any other whether the government recognized it or not.New game half the money.Its a sad life if you think you cant play games when youre married. Find yourself someone who lets you do what you love. Yeah I’ve always found that shirt (the original) so weird and depressing. I thought it was saying that getting married is a ""game over"" like your life is over now which is also a pretty depressing way to think about married life. Reddit frequently mass upvotes comments about marriage being dreadful and not getting laid or kids taking away all game time it’s like jeez yea maybe you can’t binge 8 hours of halo like you used to but even with the busiest schedule the hobby is always there to come back to and eventually you can share them with your kids![deleted]I had a gf once say ""well you're not going to play video games when you're 40"" implying that was a societal expectation.\s\sWe're not together.My fiancé wants to build a computer for me once we move back in together so we can play games no matter how many times I tell him that I’m content with just watching. That way I can do my own thing if I want to which could be watching him play or me watching tv/movies or something but we’re still spending time together. He also does DnD (with our group of friends who I’ve known for a long time) and he has tried to get me in to that too. I said I’d be better at preparing snacks for the group that’s what role I’m best at!Playing video games with my SO is honestly my favorite thing. Any coop game is made infinitely better!As much as I love games myself my favorite thing is to cuddle up with my boyfriend and watch him play and rpg.Lol that’s not the meaning of the shirt The shirt has nothing to do with video gamesI think by Game Over it refers to the arcade video game endings where the hero saves the day and lives happily ever after (in the same sense as fairy tales with 'THE END') . Not malicious precisely but I'll admit I like the New Game + idea.There is a chance that the term ""game"" is being used with a bit more imagination than your complaint recognizes.I'm totally for this! I also like video games especially the zombie ones. \s\sBut my boyfriend plays fortnite for hours and hours. He won't hear that our dog has to go out or wants water (then I'll come home and gladly do it). He doesn't say hi to me when I get home or doesn't even notice. It honestly seems neglectful :(\s\sSometimes he won't go to bed with me bc he's playing. It makes me sad. Yeah like. My girlfriend is a photographer and she's got to spend a lot of time editing. If I don't have any photos to edit myself you bet your ass I'm gonna spend a few hours blowing shit up in MGS V. \s\sI would never be in a relationship where I have no time to play games. She needs her space as much as i need mine.Some people think that maturing is about giving up the fun things in their life. I don't want to associate with those people.I love watching and sometimes playing. Of course I only really dated gamets in high school so...I think it’s more a joke.  I think it’s that after being married some partners would like you to curtail some gaming activities to spend time with them.  It’s all about balance.  Love is a beautiful thing when it is genuine.Now they have double chins.""Master Mode""Isn’t new game+ supposed to be harder than your original playthrough?*enter player two* Came here to make this comment.  Wish it was higher up. https://i.imgur.com/D8sN3tr.gifOne of my friends has been having a lot of good results doing four-player co-op. one of those new-fangled consoles with four ports n all.Ohhhh that might have to go on the wedding theme listHe didn't use the same line width to reflect the aesthetic of the graphic.[deleted]I prefer ""player 2 joined"". It should: “new game mode unlocked!”Marriage is fucking awesome. I’m happy to see a shirt that reflects this idea. If you think you’re trapped then you’re with the wrong person.  Is having a child NG++ then? Ready Player 2/r/comedynecromancy LEVEL UP +1 HeartPlot twist. New game+ is the second marriageI like this version better.\s\sit seems so odd whenever I see someone make a joke about getting married being the worst thing ever. They got married for a reason. Usually because they love each other. Why is that seen as the worst thing ever?Like the cake toppers of a crying dude being dragged by the collar. Who would actually put that in their wedding?I know my man. I can't quite wrap my head around it. Don't want to get married? D... Don't? Back in older time days people were socially expected to get married real young. It was just something you did after high school. A lot of people ended up together out of convenience resulting in a lot of unhappiness. Sure some older couples are madly in love but many seem to tolerate each other at best and sometimes even resent each other. It's also a result of how men and women weren't seen as equals in a marriage then so that divide drove people apart. Look at all the old sitcoms where the dad is an angry fat useless drunk and the mom is a shrill harpy who is either an enabler or a source of constant criticism. People today take more time to date and explore before they settle and they don't always feel obligated to be married even if they live together as a couple. That and when people prattle on about how their wife or husband annoys them so much better. How they nag or can't stand them. Why did you marry them? It's not cool to deprecate your spouse to everybody.It's like living with your best friend and having sex with them. Marriage or even a stable long term relationship is the best. I used to work by coworkers in unhappy marriages. I told them I was getting married and their response was ""Dont"". Like they shit on my engagement cause they are in unhappy marriages.\s\sLike why would you marry that person? My fiance and I are best friends. We actually get really sad being apart from one another. He went away for the weekend and it was like half of me was missing. And we've been together for a while now. Being married  isnt even that big of a deal to us because we've been together for so long and have no intentions of breaking up. We're really only doing it so we can have kids the same insurance and I can change my name. Historically a lot of people got married for financial political diplomatic or social (expectations) reasons. Many of those same reasons still exist for people today. \s\sSome people do it just so they won't die alone but even that's still a thing to be celebrated in a way. Making fun of marriage is sorta a ""safe"" joke because it's usually sort of an outlet for your single friends. Making fun on a married guy being ""whipped"" and not being let out to play or women making fun of their married girlfriend having to babysit their husband all the time let's single people not feel lonely/unwanted because being married is ""bad"". Those types of people were likely pressured into getting married when they didn’t want to. Whether from family community religion or whatever. Marriage isn’t for everyone and shouldn’t be taken lightly.Marriage =/= loveI wonder if it's in part because men traditionally are suppose to be stoic and not show emotions and getting married is the ultimate public display of emotions. Like not necessarily a conscious correlation but yeah Well sometimes people change for the worse after marriage. Could be either party’s fault but either they didn’t see the red flags or just changed completely. \s\sI’m divorced and I can say my ex changed drastically after we were married. There were red flags that I missed and behaviors that I admit I could have done differently. \s\sThere’s an old joke.   What’s the best form of birth control?  Wedding cake. \s\sYeah that was my ex. Screwed like rabbits before marriage. And then she started acting tired ON THE HONEYMOON. It was awful. \s\sThen she cheated on me twice told me she didn’t love me anymore and started dating the second guy she cheated on me with. \s\sSo that was that. [removed]Because some people can't comprehend the joys of a lifetime companionship with another person when they can't even stand themselves.Probably because they had a bad marriage. Or it's just fun to joke about how much married life sucks even if it doesn't. [removed]I agree. I was always so uncomfortable by that. I once saw a pic of a husband and wife kneeling during a wedding and the bottom of his shoes read “Help me”. Like I get its a joke and all but idk I dont like the whole “ball and chain” idea when it comes to marriage because you got married for a reason. Too many people think life ends or gets boring and dull once you marry or that you should only get married *after* youve lived a fun life and marriage is for settling and getting content with slow routine. but it doesnt have to be that way. If anything it means theyre marrying the wrong person and should be marrying someone who has the same values and can have new adventures with. \s\sI feel like a person really shouldn’t have to get married at all if they love someone enough no matter how long its been. But if you *will* get married at least make sure/act like its something you really want and are excited about. Because marriage is hard even for the most in love couples. I believe people usually say it as a joke though I'm sure many use the joke as a cover for their deteriorating and/or  toxic marriage. I work with guys that complain about their gf's and wives constantly and are always actively seeking ways to get out without them. It's pretty messed up listening to the misery they inflict on each other (workmates and their partners) and I've had to take to making up stuff my wife does that ""drives me insane"" or they look at me like I'm a freak.\s\sMy wife is entertained at all of the made up things I tell them that she does.\s\sThe reality is being with my wife is the best and if I could never leave the house ever again I'd be happy if I was with her.I'd rock this version of the shirt my wife probably would toobecause you're looking at the people who consider marriage the worst thing ever.\s\sor maybe you're looking at people who consider it the end of an era. a literal form of ""the end of your life... as a single human sitting around masturbating all day""\s\sthe point of marriage is that you aren't just one person anymore. you are no longer wheels you're a vehicle.\s\sdon't listen to the people who say it comes from exclusively unhappily married people. these jokes can be formed from love and respect too.That game takes too many quarters.  Player Two Ready would have also been cute Games are usually easier in two-player modeExcept for Halo 2 on legendary. In Cuphead the bosses take one-third the usual amount of damage while there are two players on the screen.\s\sEDIT: Oh yeah and there's also extra hazards on screen.In Monster Hunter as soon as another player joins the monster gains a 260% health bonus. Meaning it is most effective to either have one person or four. It’s your take on whatever that means for relationships. And then there's CupheadGreat quote Player 2 has joined the game!I'm guessing you have never played Magicka. So its way harder and any obstacle will instantly kill you? **#Adultery**I have a shirt like the one on the left. I like to think it means I won the game.Should say ""Player 2 Has Joined the Game""\sIt should say “player two has joined”Or Level Upshould have them side by side Game Over then have it say New Game Co-op with them smilingPlayer 3 Has Entered The Game.Love this. I've always hated that meme. I live my marriage and I game all the time!This is cute. \sI’d like one that fit the term expansion pack.new game+10I’ve never understood that mindset. If gaming is *that* important to you then don’t get married. I’d much rather set certain things in my life aside to build a better life overall with someone I love. Games can take a lower priority. \s\sSame goes for any mentality that makes people not want to get married. If you’re dragging your feet and feeling like you’re “losing” something then marriage probably isn’t right for you.On the flip side don’t marry someone who wants you to get rid of your hobbies/things you like'Player 2 has entered the game'1 up? But marriage is a game over because now you’re starting a two player one 😉I get that you're making a joke but it's just not a true statement. Your old life doesn't cease when you get married or even when you start a new relationship. You just add some new aspects to your life; Maybe some old activities get less common or may stop altogether but you're still you even when you're with someone. It's more like you were always playing a multiplayer game but now you decided to commit to a guild instead of just casual pick-up groups.More challenging but more rewarding!Nah marriage is more of a checkpoint your first child truely is a new game+\sThis time it's not you growing up however it's you a maxed out character going through the same story again and raising a little kid.\s I love this so much!Should be ‘Level up’ surelyNow just to make another one when they're both girls~People get really down on marriage and children.  I guess not focusing just on oneself isn't ""cool"".Coop modeI think I’m going to make these for my wife and I with her cricut and heat press! I love that idea of “Coop Mode”.My neighbour has something like this on his truck but it says THE END. I can't tell if it's meant to be ""lol marriage blows amirite guys!?"" or if it's like ""I found the one so it's the end of the search.""I like how they added smiles to make them look happier but in reality they look like they have double chins.hey it's me!! :DHello!

\suntil they get divorced. Then it's game over for realI love this!! Thanks for sharing. I really hate that old attitude that a woman “catches” and “ties down” a man. The “ball and chain” thing. It’s kind of a damaging sentiment to our societal view of relationships. Yours is way better 😁Heck yeah! I can’t wait for new game plus. I might save some great sidequests for it!Player 2 has entered the match. Nice. I totally cringe when someone says “happy wife happy life am I right!?”  I have mixed feelings about that saying! Like it's totally true but it's also totally one-sided? If your spouse of either gender (or neither) is unhappy there's a very good chance that your life isn't going to be happy; If you can be happy while your spouse is not (as a general thing not a specific moment thing) then there's probably a big big disconnect in your relationship and it will likely lead to problems down the line even if things seem fine now. Both partners in a relationship should endeavor to make the other happy while at the same time owning their own happiness. It's a precarious balance that I doubt anyone gets right all the time but it's both worthwhile and the only way to have a truly happy relationship. I'm not there yet with my own marriage but I recognize it as the ideal we should be striving toward. The old phrase I think kind of tries to capture this idea a little bit but it does lean on several gendered assumptions that just aren't true in my experience.\s\sI guess husband and spouse don't rhyme as well.Things will get harder in New Game+ but you do it because you love the game :DTo extend the metaphor marriage is an enjoyable 2-player RPG.  Teamwork communication and understanding each other's strengths and weaknesses are key to defeating life's levels and bosses and the rewards are incredible.New game might lead to some extra lives ;)I love this. If getting married means giving up a hobby it's already  toxic relationship. Married person here. 9.5 years so far.   It's awesome.  Everything is better because your best friend is there. ""Player 2 has joined!""I would have called it Level Up +I mean “game over” doesn’t inherently mean a bad thing. It was just a message from arcade cabinets that came up when the game was finished.\s\sThe only reason people think that it means you lost is because those old games used to have no win condition you just played until you got game over.\s\sAfter the game over was sometimes the best part when you get to type in your name for the high scores screen. That was as close as you could get to victory.It has a negative connotation  because it's *supposed* to have a negative connotation. Let's not gaslight please.Player 2 Had Entered The Game""Start Player 2""*Enter player two I’ll never understand the idea of a relationship meaning your hobbies have to die. I’m huge into gaming and my husband’s into LARPing. We try our hobbies together and see what sticks. If you don’t like it don’t destroy it for someone else. I don’t get it. Yes this all the way. When my husband and I first got married I was a handheld gamer on my DS and he was more into consoles. \s\sNow we have 2 DSs 2 Xbox Ones a PS4 and a Wii U that we play constantly. He has a game room set up and I take the living room so we can play in a party together lol.Sounds like you two would quite enjoy D&D together... assuming that you're into RPGs.My partner and I play video games and the reason why we met was because of video games. There's some genres we both enjoy and there's others we enjoy on our own. There's some things he likes that I don't like Hearthstone for example and I do roleplay (forum based) with friends when we marry we still will have time for our individual hobbies just like we do now as a couple. \s\sTo people who believe that once you get married it's ""game over"" maybe don't get married? you forgot about the kids part tho.relationship doesn't but babies surely do. at least for some timei got this as a joke for a buddy's stag.\s\shis fiancee fucking cried over it. yeah. Just remember kids this is a game that isn’t PVP.Has a baby;\sPlayer 3 has joined the gameIt's just the dlc with co-op modeLove the message dont really like the press start fontPlayer 2 has entered the game.Id like the original one on the front and the new one on the back :}Chrono Trigger for the win!! 😊Married 12 years as of last week...still have my ""Game Over"" tee from my bachelor party. \s\sIt doesn't fit but I still have it haha.Life: Marriage expansion packThat’s pretty dang cute Marriage is the Dark Souls of relationshipsThis post and this thread make me happy. :D>	Player 2 has joined the game. \s\sETA: dammit too late every variation of this comment was made already.

Never been happier.Yeah I love is a horse in thing but you do kind a get screwed over in marriageI want the NG+ one when I find someoneCool! I'm getting married in October just papers and a nice party with friends and family to celebrate we'd totally wear these. I prefer (Player 2 Has Joined The Game)Ed! (Player 2 has left the game.)The problem is the phrase ""Game Over"" is seen as a negative thing. But what happens when you save Princess Peach at the end of Super Mario Brothers?\s\sThe Game is Over.Player 2 has joined the game !My husband was given the original shirt when we married. He never wore it and told the giver that he was pretty excited to be forming a new co-op. :)Mmm nope still game overI remember I had this T-shirt on the left many years ago I wore it in my house and my mum and sisters didn't understand it but my brother and dad straight away knew what it meant.\s\sBut the one on the right is much better.Married the love of my life this year and she suggested we buy a Nintendo Switch to celebrate the occasion.I think they both work and the first one can be interpreted as love is the goal of lifePlayer 2 has joined the game!What was the original shirt? Just the first panel?Wait till you get the dlcs. More like new game of a different gamemode. Some stuff is easier others are harder but it's the only one that's truly co-op :)I honestly can’t believe so many people in this thread think the original is literally about not being about to play video games anymore.

The symbology in the meme is very....elitist? Negative? Divisive? All of the above? My point is this isn't wholesome.Maybe you need a better outlook on the meme friend. It looks like wholesomememe's wholesomeness is the water and it's spilling out into other subs! Also if you just want to browse all and that makes you happy that is fine as well :)what? are you telling me that any sub that get into r/all is shit isnt wholesome? oh no![removed]Its probably all the same water.

It should be us-and-not-us-yet!first time I saw someone from r/wholesomememes my first reaction was ""i don't get the joke.""I haven’t been on r/all for like a year. I did it today. It was a mistake.

This one is probably the biggest but every contribution helps.Would you mind sharing some of those?Share plz?Well someone can make a new one r/wholesomecirclejerk and this can be the first post*amPlease share the othersThere's r/WholesomeCats if you wanna check it out\sIt's my own creation (: still a work in progress tho. Only 3 posts so far but I'm working on it.Just the right thing after an exhausting dayWow I didn’t expect this to get many upvotes but I guess I should explain since some are concerned about unwholesomeness.\s\sI’m not trying to put down other subs with this meme I’m just saying that this sub in particular is always brings me a bit more happiness than others :) and I hope it provides a light place for other redditors as wellOr r/all is murky and you’re not always sure what you’re gonna get positive or negative while here you always know you bout to get some nice memes People shouldn't be concerned. It's like being upset that we call this sub wholesome because it implies the others are not.In my humble observation many posts are about depression often finding a tiny positive thing in an otherwise hopeless situation and in almost every thread there is at least one highly upvoted comment arguing with the post while expressing deep visceral dissatisfaction with their lives. \s\sI've always felt there was a dark undercurrent to /r/wholesomemes a thin gilding of [the emotional and mental devestation of a generation](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/) with inconsequential niceties.They're so rich they have a swimming pool in their swimming poolCan we have the link to the original picture?\s(for meminess)it’s posted in meme economy if you want to invest :)Empty the pool to obtain the  infamous inverted pool. [removed][removed]Isnt that a fish farm lolStill has a ladder inviting everyone in though 😉Except this sub has way too much of a ""1950's Stepford Wife Smile-or-else"" vibe going on. It's one thing to want to promote positivity but this entire sub feels incredibly cultish.*youuuu have a great day sir!*\s\s*Sending lots of positive chakra yourrrr way!!!! :)))))))*Completely agree. Hang on there just a minute... we almost have it full This isn't wholesome. I do consider it a meme so it's better than a lot of posts on this sub.\s\sI'm just disappointed really disappointedWhat's another drink when you are already drowning?Don't ostracize the others. Let them join in tooThis is perfect because it's probably all the same water but the blue pool lining makes it look cleanerI don't think dissing all  other subs is very wholesomeThere is plenty of good stuff on /r/all! Sure there are political subreddits and bully subreddits but there's so much good to see out there!Yeah I thought the whole point of this sub was to be... friendly?Lakes can still be fun to swim in they just tend to have some ickyness at times. Same thing with subs that aren't totally wholesome. Still fun but when you touch the bottom your toes will go into some cold icky comments. I don’t think recognizing /r/wholesomememes as separate from the rest of Reddit is a negative or even an indictment of the rest and I would contend that it’s the exact reason for it to exist; allow a corner of Reddit to be a positive place. \s\s\sShame that you interpret it in such a manner because nobody could possibly feel ""attacked"" by this harmless and clearly playful post.\s\sThe comment sections are more ""tough"" on certain /r/all posts that's a fact. But this post isn't a ""personal attack"" towards users who browse other /r/all subs.I don't see this as a diss?It’s a light-hearted joke. /r/all reporting in! I think your dissing of the dissing of other subs is not wholesome!\s\sJust kidding /r/all would call you a nazi or something.Came here to say this.Yea this sub sucksYeah kinda sad but not surprising.This is why I love you guys :)I think the inner pool should be leaking because our wholesomeness isn't restricted to a subreddit!

\sThe Sikh temple in my community also serves the Hindu community because their population is a lot lower and they can’t afford a temple.  Pretty cool stuff.

This is so sweet This is the most beautiful thing in the world. I think it cured my bad night <3 It’s cute though r/humansbeingbrosA Sikh man indeed!I'm a Christian but I don't remember ever reading anything bad about Sikhs as a group.  In fact I generally see really positive things about em.\s\sAlso gotta respect a faith that commands the adherents to protect those who cannot protect themselves.\s\s<3I mean Christianity says to do that but a lot of people kinda choose to ignore those sections. In the mid 1980s there was a relatively strong Sikh nationalist movement in India that includes terrorist elements. Said terrorists blew up [Air India Flight 182](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182) en route from Vancouver and Montréal to London and New Delhi killing 329 people. A second bomb was supposed to take down another flight going westbound but the bag [exploded at Narita Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Narita_International_Airport_bombing) before it could be loaded onto the plane.\s\sI mention this attack not to demonize Sikhs in any way only to point out that all religious groups — all large groups of humanity really — have their positive and negative influences on the world. Sikh nationalism has pretty much died out in the 33 years since the attack. And I hope more people will take inspiration for their actions from photos like this post’s and not from violence and hatred.Well all religions and non-religious groups have done terrible things. Sikhs included.\s\sIts best not to ponder about the evils of man. Can we not generalize about religion at all here? Because it's not gonna end well even if it's well intentioned. People do god-awful things in the name of religion just as they do beautiful compassionate things. It's just not reliable or fair or just to say oh he's a Sikh so he's a nice guy.\s\sHe's a nice guy and he happens to be Sikh.> I'm a Christian but I don't remember ever reading anything bad about Sikhs as a group\s\sMull that statement over for a second. There were Sikh's who blew up a plane in a terrorism attack in Canada but that doesn't say anything about Sikh's as a group.\s\sSame with every religion. \s\s(And if I can opine a bit Christianity is just bad and incoherent philosophy but that doesn't say anything about Christians as a group.)Thanks a huge part of out religion is ""we just don't like bullies""Sikhs have been tame in comparison to a lot of other religions.  They are almost always chill.  They had a violent nationalists movement for a bit but that seems to have been forgotten by the community itself. So hecking cute. Brightened my day We can all Sikh to learn something about Humanity from Sihks.I smell an infidel. This dude's sikhThere's this one sikh guy in my school had classes with him last year didn't know much English but everyone knew he was pretty cool What's the problem to pray at your home???yall fellas just ever build your hommie a building???I would  but all my friends disowned me for being atheist jokes on them ;-; I build cardboard castles for my cats all the time.What are the rules? I’m down. I build a pillow fort for my best mate when I was 9.\s\sWe played taken 3 for 5 hoursSomeday Hope the sikh man is doing well 😊I think that’s a crazy amazing thing for a human being to do. To be so thoughtful and caring about another person is truly beautiful. I just wonder.. if you 100% believe in your religion would you be 100% supportive of your friend being in another? \s\sI have a religion and I don’t talk about religion with my friends at all. Like ever. I support their right to choose to do whatever they want with their life. ..but I still do want them not end up in hell you know?JustSNThingsNice green screen yoThis makes me so happy. ❤️What a mensch.Victory RoyaleThat's a cool looking little mosque. I'd pray in that mosque and I'm an atheistI've always appreciated the architecture of places of worship aside from the majority of Christian churches as they mostly look like they come off an assembly line. What can I say when your religion espouses the pursuit of all knowledge art geometry and architecture make something beautiful. [removed]I'm curious does it ever go the other way?\s\sI see stories occasionally about  Sikh people building things for others..  but do muslim people build for other religions?\s\s\sI really don't know anything about either of them but am curious.[deleted]I have seen this before but wow. Imagine your friend come up to you and say: hey so i heard x means a lot you so i built you a building broDude this guy is sihk. He was able to muslim up a mosque. \s\sI ran out of puns. SorryNow waiting for a Moslem to build a Sikh temple. LOL.God bless ! ❤️Sick!Hope that Sikh man gets to feeling better soon. Seems like a nice guy. What a nice guy. I hope he gets healthier soonwhat makes you think he’s unhealthy?Nice.SikhSikh and ye shall find.That looks like a good hugThe best part about this is you know there are so people just learning that there's a difference between the twoAHAHAHAHA THATS SO TRUE!!! I’m a Muslim and I’ve gotten “wait I thought you were like Indian” before... they meant Hindu... and I’m Bangladeshi XDNah man the best part is that they are so kind :iBack in 2011 in the UK there were riots up and down the country with people looting and vandalising everything. It was mainly due to escalation of events following a fatal police shooting of a young man however it was used by many as an excuse to just go mad unfortunately. \s\sIt just so happened to have taken place during the month of Ramadan where Muslims attend a night prayer at mosques during this time Sikhs stood outside the mosques as deterrents to any potential vandals. Muslims did the same and protected the Sikh temples while the Sikhs did their own night-time prayers (Kirtan Sohila). They both came together to protect churches within the city too. \s\s[Here’s the article from the local news](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-riots-muslims-and-sikhs-guard-159529) \sSikh’s are some of the nicest most generous and tolerant people I have ever met. Really good guy. Any friend would be good :/ damn - sikh mosqueGuess you could say that was really \s#SikhThis is what puts my faith back in people! Look out for each other respect one another and help each other. [deleted]That’s the problem isn’t it? It’s as if there’s a sort of carnal drive to *take* and *have*.Can someone just build is mosque ? Like obviously it looks like one but doesn’t it need an Imam or blessing or something? \sStill a cool picture. I hope he gets better God I love sikhs. My heart... this is so pure they’re so happy oh my goodness this is wonderfulheartwarming life-affirming fuckin awesomeness.That is pretty Sikh indeed.Tbh he could’ve prayed anywhere - you don’t need a mosque to prayWonderful. When our eyes are set towards heaven we are all family.Hope he gets better soon!I like the green color.Green has a special significance in Islam as it’s the color of Paradise Sikhs are lovely people in general. I don’t remember the last time i heard someone talk bad about Sikhs. Im muslim by the wayTheir whole outlook on life and religion is great. They basically believe there is no wrong way to God so are accepting of different faiths. I've known a lot a Sikhs and they are all a bunch of lovely people with one exception. But that's just because he just had a shit personality.People don't talk bad about Sikhs because they carry swords and know how to use them.\s\sJust kidding but ya my Sikh friends have always been super chill. It's a solid culture.For nicest stereotyped religious persons I think it would go Sikhs Mormons Lutherans. I’ve met some real asshole Buddhists but that could just be because I live in Colorado.As a religion they seem great. Unfortunately like many religions/religious cultures as soon as you try and marry into that religion when you aren't the same there's A LOT of issues. Sikhism especially is hard  because you cannot even convert if you wanted to you're just screwed.[removed]My dad had a Sikh at his work who assaulted a woman in the elevator. So here you go. “It would be great if human beings were great at being human and if all of mankind was made of people that were kind.”\s\sThis is it. It's nice to be nice. It's good to be good.I wholeheartedly agree. \s\sI guess the only thing left to do is find out how to delete these few pesky lines in Islamic scripture that command Muslims to either kill or convert the non-believers.This is dope!Why does this mosque look like shrek?*WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY MOSQUE??*Because it has layers. I just want stuff like this to happen everywhere.Can u build me a house plzThey do but they get overshadowed by hate in the media because that's what gets clicks. When you’re a veteran at a game and decide to help out your newbie friendWonder if the Muslim man specifically asked for it to be neon green. Bold color choice but I bet God was happy to see some flair.\s\sEdit: TIL green is associated with Islam.in South Asian cultures lots of Islamic buildings tend to be some shape of Green  usually bright green. I'm not sure why tbh.Almost all mosques I've seen in my life were green coloured. I heard it's because prophet Mohammed liked the colour green.Well my dude if I’m going to guess the Muslim man most certainly did. He wanted it to be easily visible to everyone so he could be like “yo check this out. My buddy built me a mosque just because! Fucking badass right?!” \s\sNot a Muslim but I believe what's most important is that it's plain and white from the inside which it seems to be. Big fan of the neon green though.I’m from Delhi. But I’m not Muslim. However I’ve noticed Muslim communities have a lot of green in them and even a lot of Islamic countries have green flags (Pakistan Saudi Arabia etc). It’s a really nice atmosphere in these communities especially the amazing music that rings throughout that area. Such a shame that this type of religion has the worst reputation possibleThey’re going to replace it with a better mosque in post-production That’s sik.So ge can green screen it into whatever cool pattern he wants. Green is a very prevalent colouring Islam. I cannot upvote this enough.  This isn't some fake act of kindness for internet points this is real.[deleted]Faaabulous! r/wholesomemuslimr/subsyoufellforOk this is so sweet 😭 Now if someone would just rebuild Sheryl’s she-shed for her. Wow. I simply love this picture itself. I'm actually Muslim and that grass green architectural masterpiece looks better than 9/10 mosques I've ever been to.\s\sI guess I could say I'm... \s\sGREEN WITH ENVY AHAHAH!!!Sikhs are truly wonderful people and are for the most part totally misunderstood. Sikhism is one of those religions that you just have to respect. They're like the sweet old lady that always brings cupcakes to the BBQ even though everyones fighting over family beefYeah just casually build a structure in the form of a building like ya do.Humanity goals is getting rid or religion.SiikkkhhhhhIs it made out of lime stone?I've never me a Sikh I didn't like. A letter/wordthat's not a sikh man that's the sikhest man.Human squee! Fuckin adorable!Sikh's are so based.Sikhs are kind of known for being chill like that. They're not fanatical like many would assume**sorts by controversial**Top comment says ""God is great"" Wow that's Sikh.Hope he gets better soon!r/MadeMeSmileDammit why can't humanity as a whole just be like these two?!!There’s hope for humanityCoolOne of my best friends is Sikh awesome guy all around his immediate and extended family are all awesome people as well. Love the culture very accepting while also being warriors. This is so old.[deleted]I think it’s in the sense that without an accessible mosque Muslims (in regions where they are minorities) tend to feel like outsiders.\s\sThe mosque is literally a gesture that says “You’re welcome here. Forever.”But I’m sure it is nice to have your own little place of worship LOUD NOISES!!Friendship goals is to create a portrait of your friend made out of thousands of dice.I read “sikh” as SICCWish this was the norm and not the exception...That's pretty SikhThese kinds of folks make up most of the islamic population. As with the right-wing and left-wings only a small fringe will ever go about bombing and attacking. Most are devout and pious people. Its wise to remember that to prevent divisions and paranoia because at the end of the day we’re all people and we all deserve respect and kindness.\s\sExcept Micah. Fuck MicahTHANK YOU. I’m just a girl in high school and everyone thinks I’m out to bomb the place. Like??That picture of the hug nearly has me in tears... just looks so damn wholesome.Definitely one of the best hugs ive ever seenI know! Same here :)I hope he gets better soon\sWow I can't even get out of bed when I'm Sikh!Jew Buddha be jokingSource? Most middle eastern folks I have met are very sweet accepting people. It's a shame that they get lumped in with extremists. I think even those of us who consider ourselves left leaning even forget just how *small* a percentage of the middle eastern populace is radicalized. It's positively infinitesimal compared to the global population. Also Sikhs rule. Have met some really nice bareass naked stick welding Sikhs walking the streets of India.  \s\sI think its also easy to forget just how many different faiths coexist in these countries. They get framed as all muslim uptight and intolerant but it's just not the case. r/HumansBeingBrosCmon I expected better from this sub than anti-Islam or anti-religion comments. Talk about that all you want but isn’t this sub for spreading smiled instead of condemning others? [removed][removed]Sikh mosque broSikh are the nicest mother fuckers in the world. Every single time I have interacted with a practicioner it has been nothing but an absolute delight. Such a wholesome collection of people.Can confirm. I did my MSc in Wales at a university that attracted people from all around the world. The Sikh students I met there seemed to all have figured out how to be pragmatically and authentically nice humans. this is exactly what religion should be about.[deleted]Does god actually care where you pray i thought the act of just praying was good enough So sikh bro ❤️Sikh male here- thanks for the nice comments friends!

I've been wanting to visit a local gurudwara recently. Is it okay if I use a bandana I have at home to cover my head? Other than covering the head and taking off the shoes is there anything else manners-wise which I should know?\s\sAnd I'll be honest langar sounds great as well. What time is it usually served? :DBy any chance do you carry a sword around with you.Sikh too! Gotta love them puns eh? Lived in New Delhi the last four years and every Sikh person I met was kind and helpful and fun. Made some lifelong friends. What religion are most Sikhs I assumed most of you were Muslim.

Sajjan Singh is the older brother of Joga Singh who is the Sikh in the photo who manages their estate back home.  When this story got on TV in 2015 about a mosque that had been destroyed during partition was being rebuilt the Ghuman family didn't understand all the fuss.  It's just bros being bros.This made me cry a little bit. It's so nice to see a bit of kindness in the world still.That dude is Sikh with it.>he had nowhere to pray\s\s\sI didn't realize Muslim people actually needed to be in a mosque in order to pray? Maybe I'm wrong but I thought as long as the person faced Mecca it was fine. \s\s\sSorry for being ignorant I'm not exactly a religion expert Yeah they can pray anywhere that is clean as long as they try to face the right direction. However its bonus points to pray together with other people which is what mosques are built to house. Subscribe to PewDiePie. Get well soonWithin the Sikh community there are good and bad. I don't buy into The notion that all Sikhs are nice and wonderful. I've been around Sikhs all my life. Many Sikhs I've met seem to have an arrogance about them. They go on about being warriors. Not much humility.\s\s I see very little interaction with others outside the Sikh or greater Punjabi community. Very little intermarriage with non Punjabis. I wonder how many Sikhs invite Gorahs or blacks into their homes? I wonder if a Gorah could actually attend a langar without any trouble? \s\s They love money so much that they import large amounts of drugs into Canada to supply the illegal drug trade. No consideration for the lives they ruin with the drugs they import.\s\sSikhism is good. How most Sikhs I've met over the years really don't practice true Sikhism in their private and public lives. It is hard to resist the lure of big money or to control one's ego. Like every thing else there the ""ideal"" version and the real version.\s\s I not slagging Sikhs. Most people regardless of religion culture or ethnicity are shitty. Few can rise up and fight their own selfishness and ego. That's life. what a sihk friend.I wish there were better people in the world like this. It is a rarity to find someone so pure and whole.[deleted]I don’t know why your getting downvoted?Wholesome pillsYour friends can’t call you weeaboo trash if you have no friendsI still will if it'll make you feel betterIs weeaboo trash the weeaboo or the person that likes weeaboos?

Thank you.\sI really needed this. Thank you x 😓My best friend wrote me a multiple page letter a few months ago detailing all the held-in resentment and contempt she's had for me over the 10 years I've known her essentially ending our friendship. I was completely blindsided. I should have trusted the voices in my head telling me that she secretly hated me.\s\sFeels bad man.I mean I had met a person who I thought was a good friend but ended up gossiping behind my back and kicked me out of a friendship group. Its been five months and I still feel betrayed and thinking of my reputation and friendships has gotten the worst of me.\s\sMaybe my friends like me but I knew a person who didn't and it ruined me.My brain is an ass.\s\sI was stressing all week over this warrant to my arrest that cost me a potential job. Worrying about jail time a record whole life ruined.\s\s\sIn reality the judge started off by telling me the state was willing to work with me cause the offense was so minor it was my first one and he understands how it slipped my mind. It was pretty common apparently.\s\sThen I told him I actually went ahead and paid my debt already. I had a whole folder of stuff to show to explain how things escalated this far and why. Didn't even need it.\s\sTook like 60 seconds. The prosecutor made a copy of the receipt and dismissed the case.\s\sMy brain was the worst person throughout this entire ordeal. Even the cops and other people turning themselves in were super nice.Damn I was just having a moment where I realized I didn’t know what people thought of me.

College: do my friends hate me or do I just need to go to sleep?Sometimes you just need a meme to slap you in the face with some reality.The meme could be wrong you know.  Your friends might very well be taking advantage of you.  Or hate you.  Or they could be plotting your murder.  The point is no new information about your life was actually gleaned by your reading this meme.   Fuckin same man it's weirdly been on my mind all day for some reason sameI’ve often been afraid to invite family old school friends and people I’m friendly with at work to personal social events. I’ve had little problems socializing and people tend to think I am outgoing. Lol that happens to me a lotHoly fuck how did this meme know what I was thinking? And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself.Thank you whoever made this been having a real tough time lately and this really brightened my day.What friends?Can someone please explain what this post meansi wish more people would understand thisNah I don't believe it.I don't believe it. It can't be trueYep. I heard an annoying song last week for a total of 5 seconds and my brain has been playing on a constant loop ever since.

It was true for me and I thought I was a garbage piece of shit no one liked but it turned out there were a lot of people who did care about me I just wasn't seeing it. I know it sounds like I'm so full of shit cause I thought the same thing until I had a few separate one on one occasions with friends where they told me otherwise. You have to remember that the lens you are viewing life through is horribly distorted. I've been there man don't let it break you down. You offer more than you'd ever give yourself credit for.

We’ve moved way beyond a working relationship and I try to at least text her something encouraging everyday. My brian keeps telling me she’s just being nice but I know she loves me as much as I love her. I don’t know why I’m so insecure about it. This one hit home a little too hard.

And to think i was worried they didn't like me that muchWow... I started crying. Thank you for this it’s just a silly meme on the internet but I didn’t realize how bad of a past couple of days I’ve been having. Thank you I really needed thisMe too.

I really hope your days start going better <3[deleted]I really need you right nowI needed this today thanks :)I learned a while back to separate my mind from my brain and not in some flaky metaphysical way.\s\sI realized that if I could recognize my moods and impulses as being bio-neurological in origin I could exert conscious influence on them.\s\sThis was among a suite of epiphanies I experienced over a short period of time that shaped my current philosophical world view.\s\sIt works well for me. When I find myself pissed of at everone I see I ask ""Why am I pissed off? Is it because everyone is being an asshole? Or is it because I am hungover hungry or short on sleep?""\s\sWhen I'm well drunk and tempted to grab a sixer from the corner store I remind myself that I'm well drunk and my brain is simply craving a hit of reward.\s\sThe brain isn't necessarily mean it's just super-duper needy and will take any attention it can.The mind creates emotions by tightening muscles in the body.Is it hormones? I've read men also have dips in thier overall emotional state a few days of the month. My day could start out great but an anger/tension builds within me and I have to just get away from people or risk being really toxic and vile towards them because every little thing just seems to irritate me further.I hate thisJesus Christ I don't think you realize how much this means to me.. I recently moved out of state and my friends mean alot to me we're all heartless assholes in person probably because we don't share our feelings\sbecause of our shit pasts.

And at what point does it cross a line into mental illness? The majority of my self-directed thoughts are neutral to negative. Friends? friends?????I really needed this.That what my therapist said right up till my best friend abandoned me! Sometimes the brain is right!Mine threw scissors at me then I hit him with a block of wood but we still cool.Lies Deception!First post on my first page and it says everything I needed to hear Your friends also use you and change. I just left a party my friends were all at feeling kinda down and this just popped up. I appreciate this and hope it is truei dont undertand help plss?damnI mean actually wanting to do something we both like rather than what they just like and have it be more than once a month or longer when I'm not doing anything would be a great way to show it.Too real.Man I wish everything I saw in the internet was realI take melatonin nightly. This was incredible. Thank you.I seriously don't understand this after looking at it for a while... Can some explain? For people with mental illness and/or low self-esteem and/or trust and abandonment issues the very idea that their friends and family actually do love them and don't secretly hate them can seem like a crazy fallacy. Our brains hiss at us basically every moment waking or asleep that everyone secretly hates having us around wishes we were gone etc etc.\s\sThe ""hard pill to swallow"" is the fact that people *do* love us and that it's our sick brains tricking and bullying us that has made us so convinced otherwise. It's not a perfect analogy but it fits well enough that it's basically saying ""you may not believe it you may fight it with all your might but you *are* loved.""Made plans with my friends to see Infinity War. Cancelled twice on me then went to see it with another of our friends without even askin if I wanted to go. Yea don’t think this applies to me.Nah I’ve seen the things they say about me. It’s why I’m cutting them out of my life. Nah nobody loves meThank you! I needed this today. What if I don't love them!considering not a single one of them has messaged me in over 4 days ehh. ""You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.""\s\sDale Carnegie How to Win Friends and Influence People\s\sAll people want to be reached out to it's not just you. Don't start judging how much they like you until they start repeatedly turning down your requests to spend time together. I'm gonna be blunt when they repeatedly turn you down you can *begin* considering that they might not like you.I mean have you messaged them? Friendship is a two way street. Sitting around waiting for everyone to come to you is a good way to make them think you aren't interested in being their friend. It’s been three weeks for me. I gave up waiting for a reply after week 2. I don’t know what I did so I assume it’s just me as a person in general they don’t like. I really really don’t want to be alone but this has been happening my whole life and I don’t know what to do anymore.4 days? Is that it? Lmao. I’m pretty sure if I dropped off the face of the earth and stopped texting them it’d be a while before any of them reach out I literally don’t have any friends and memes like this just remind me that most other people do and depress me much moreI really love thisThat awkward moment when you cant tell if you're in r/depression_memes or r/wholesomememes Huh. I hadn't really considered friends ""not liking me"" since middle school but I had to stop reading these comments because I could feel little worms of doubt creeping into my brain. Not cool..../r/wholesome_meirl?So I just really like how this say your friends “love” you. It’s not just that they like you or tolerate you. Your friends love you and that is an amazing thing. To know people outside of your family care so deeply for you. \s\sIf this said “your friends like you” I’d probably just have scrolled past and said meh. But the idea of friends loving each other is just foreign and interesting enough to me that it caught my eye. Yes I love my friends and I don’t think I recognize this enough.\s\sI don’t know. This is probably just super rambley and pointless but this idea brought me joy. So thanks!Man I love this subreddit. Thanks for this OP you're a good person. <3I don't get it. ELi5.I needed this ive been lonely and my friends have been busy the past few weeks. I literally had a mental argument with them over it a few hours ago lol. Good timing with this post!I sent this one to my SO because they're in such a bad way right now and I can't do anything about it. It's killing me to see them go through it. Honestly I really needed this. For the longest of times I've always thought that my friends dont really want me around and are just friends with me because of pity for me being alone..""Nuh-uh you're a bullshit artist!""For true?For true. A lot can change when you start putting your thoughts into perspective. I've been working on it for a few years and it has done wondersFor big?My best evidence that my friends like me is that they suddenly have somewhere else to be when I’m around.I need to write some emails.This is nice and comforting to swallow Needed this especially yesterday so thanks friend!Damn I’ve needed this for a long time thank you.Friends?\s\sEDIT: Thanks for the downvotes. Sorry I don't have any friends. r/bonehealingjuiceThis is just what I needed just nowThis is great and make me feel not crazy!Right now i logged onto reddit full of hate and rage looking to dig up some nasty things i wrote a long time ago. But i open the front page and see this this  made me fell alot bettter about the situation im in. Thank you i needed this.  Thank YouThanks for this :)After tonight this was the first thing to pop up on my feed and was very coincidental to my situation tonight. Thank you to whoever posted this. I have always struggled with overthinking and have had cases of blurred lines between these moments. Ima go out on a limb here and say since they just hung out without me that this is incorrectHaha oh yeah? Well why hasnt my only friend talked to me for 3 months nowOkay but what if I'm not sure if I love me?I don’t understand how a meme can mess me up this badly. It’s just a stupid picture with stupid text and I’m just so fucked up by it I can’t comprehend it. Hello!

\sThis sticky is so wholesome! I love itMy brain must hate the shit out of me fr i dont have anyThe first step in depression recovery is to realize that your brain is the enemy and cannot be trusted.What friends? I wish this was trueI’ve lost most of my friends due to alienating myself when I was in an abusive relationship. I don’t know how to process this. I think you mean: \s\sYour friends don't really love you. You're brain is just fooling you to think they do.It'll take more than 🤷‍♀️I read that as ""Your friends do I love you your Brian is just mean"". I've got something wrong with my Brian I guess :/I love this community so much. :')[removed]I don't think its meant to simplify it for anyone  it's a little prod to remind us that sometimes our brain really is just being mean ..If anyone reads this and thinks its that easy they don't have any experience dealing with mental health issues.  It's difficult to understand if you haven't been through it yourself or been close to someone who's going through it.Thank you for sharing. My brain is a huge asshole and some positive reinforcement is always nice.WholesomeI don't get itBrain creates false insecurities. Just because you think a thing doesn't make it true.Friends?They mean NPCs. I have one friend that keeps telling me he loves me. Then everyone else tells me the shit he says behind my back. Those other people don’t say they love me but they’re obviously the ones who do. Never trust those assholes who don’t demonstrate their loyalty but only declare it. I really could have used this as a kid... i was very delusional growing up I didn't have much trust and didn't believe my friends cared at all. I thought maybe my life was a tv show and all my friends just laughed at me and made fun and only came on the tv show (hung out with me) was when they wanted more content for laughs.\sI don't view myself as the centre of attention/main person of a tv show anymore xDI hate them all so I have reasons to believe we all hate each other and go out together so we're not alone all the timeYeah but my friend literally told me ""********* I hate you chunk"" being fully seriousThen they're not your friend and you need to find someone new. \s\sYou could definitely do way better.\sGarbage person or mean or misunderstood meaning which I like to believe is the truth in most cases I really really needed this today. <3[removed]This is very relevant to me right now... My brain always takes the most self deprecating route like when a friend doesn't text back within a half an hour I'm just a joke and people only tolerate me when they have to.Big if trueWell my now Ex doesnt... But thankfully my friends are there[deleted]Wow.  Most of this hits so close to home.   I don’t get it?A lot of people assume their friends secretly hate them and that they are only being nice\s\sIt sucks and even knowing better doesn't stop the feelingsI hope you never do get itBless your soul you magnificent creature continue your pure lifeLook at this guy with friends and no excruciatingly dark depression. It took some time for me to get it as well. Let me see if I can write it down in a proper format.\s\sIt is *hard to swallow* ^hard ^to ^accept the *pill* ^the ^fact that your friends do actually love you.\s\sI guess a lot of people get worried by thinking that their friends are only nice to them in person.Lucky youNeither do I. And I had attempted in the past before. I guess I have never actually been depressed beforeIs that a hard pill to swallow? I think a harder pill would be trying to feel like you're loved when you feel like it's just your brain that doesn't think so then realizing that it really is you and it's worse than you thought.For real though. I recently was informed that I have cancer and it was incredible how many people care about you.. people you thought that didn't care will do anything to help you out. It's incredible and it has really helped me cope with the news/r/thingsthatdidnthappenBut who's going to pay for his trip to the burn ward?TacopayersThis is so pure I've never gotten a negative reaction. Most people just say ""Woah you can pay with your watch?""\s\sI think my favorite is being in small businesses that say they don't have Apple Pay then you see the icon and BOOM their live is forever changed and then immediately back to normal.Such a badass. Wow. That happened.A better story would of been that he tried to pay for his coffee with his timex. Starbucks doesn’t accept Apple Pay...  you can only use a Starbucks card on your WatchHow did she pay for his order after paying for her own one? Wow laying for the food you ordered harnessing an advancement in technology that was only sci-fi for most of his life. Disgraceful. I'll just leave this [here.](https://www.organicconsumers.org/essays/five-reasons-boycott-starbucks)\s\sBut yeah buying coffee for a stranger is much better than considering this while choosing where to get your coffee so bring in the downvotes.and then the barista clappedWow paying for the food you ordered. \s\sThis country is going to shit.Love how ""not understanding a thing"" is why everything is ""bad"". He probably didn't think that through before he spoke. But even a crusty old man is someone's favorite grandpa! He'll maybe think differently about it the next time he orders a coffee. [deleted]No! You must keep your money in your wallet! Then I want to see you put your credit card into the chip reader only to have the cashier tell you that their chip reader doesnt work and you have to swipe! Also you must keep your credit card numbers visible at all times to the person who you cant tell if they're maybe just to close or trying to steal your card information! Then I want you to put two fingers on the pin buttons and only press one of them for your first pin number to confuse the thief! Then and only then will you get your purchase.To be fair this story is as fake and dumb as the shit baby boomers post on fb to elicit responses from the opposite point of view. For instance a relative of mine recently posted an image of a war hero looking soldier with a caption like: ""Next time you point and laugh at a vet remember... Blah Blah"" And I was thinking let me stop you right there with your weird strawman nobody is pointing and laughing at war vets...don't worry baby boomers are close to death lmaoHow does this play out in his mind? How do you go from using technology to pay for food to destroying the country?“Your what’s wrong with America”  but I’ll accept the “wrong” gift your giving me.GET OFF MY LAWN YOU GENEROUS BASTARD!“When I was your age we used to dine and dash all the time! You’re actually paying for your food?! Pathetic! What gas this county come to..”I call BS. What's an old guy doing in Starbucks buying a coffee?Probably informing everyone they are what is wrong with America.waiting to bitch about the red cupsChaotic good. Headshot with AWM of kindnessthat's one way to get a free coffee.5000BC Today an old guy told me I was part of what's wrong with Lydia when I used a coin to pay for my cow. \s\s740BC Today an old guy told me I was part of what's wrong with the Tang Dynasty when I used paper money to pay for my rice.\s\s1950AD.  Today an old guy told me I was part of what's wrong with America when I used my Diner's Club card to pay for dinner.\s\s.\s\s.\s\s.\s\s2345AD Today an old guy told me I was part of whats wrong with the Galactic Arm Federation when I used TTP (Telegraphed Thought Patterns) to pay for my Starbucks order.  (Apparently coffee is still a thing in 300 years)[deleted]That sounds pretty basic but at least you helped him outYou shouldn't give a fraction of your payment to the giant Apple corporation Starbucks needs that money!Chaotic GoodAnd realistically did nothing to change his mindset in even the tiniest of ways. He probably just thinks you’re an idiot for doing that and in turn you wasted your money. Life isn’t like a movie. You didn’t give this man some revelation because you paid for his coffee. Hello!

Be the change you wish to seeToday in stuff that never happened land...Why use Apple pay at Starbucks ? If you use Starbucks app you can get free drinks?Not everyone goes there every day. In order to get rewards from the app don’t you need a ton of stars and shit? Doesn’t that equate to like over $100+ spent? What a kind lady :)Yea I'm gonna call bullshit on this one. She's one line away from ""... and then everyone clapped."" r/wholesomemadladsI don't get it how is paying quickly and efficiently for something a bad thing?Sounds like this “old guy” was either joking or made-up entirely.[deleted]She was talking about someone in his early 30s. I can't even imagine what he'd mean by that. I just...I've got no idea at all.Lame\sPeople assume this isn’t made up lolShe was generous out of spite then went straight to the internet to share how great she is with the world. Her *goodness* is like the bow on a big box of selfserving BS. She also managed to give us an idea of how well she's doing financially\s\sI think that guy was dead-onOr she’s calling out him for representing his generation poorly similarly to the way he (and you) are calling her out and her generation. Screw that old man. He's not even *aware* of what's wrong with this country.I use apple pay and my dad uses android pay and my mother freaks out every time because she don't trust dem devices love it :)))""You're what's wrong with America.""\s\s\s""...progress?""And then everyone clapped Lack of continued progress is genuinely what is wrong with America. You can't fight progress and expect to stay a leader. I'm going to try this!  So I just need to tell people they are part of the problem for free food?No. He's what's wrong with America. I will take all the downvotes in the world for this but I can't stand old people that try to stop progress. We must move forward but we can't with all these old people stuck in their old ways.Do you stil get stars?Y’all don’t honestly believe this shit right I’m an old guy and I love apple pay [deleted]Mark of the Beast stuff you know.As a former cashier the only people I ever saw paying like this were elderly men. I'm not sure why that was but if I had to guess I'd say their children or grandchildren bought them this new bit of tech and showed them how to use it and so they go out of their way to use it. At least I know that my grandparents do that.The first time I used my watch to pay for something the old dude at the pharmacy was like ""SHE USED HER WATCH TO PAY""! He was so impressed it was adorable. This is the kind of thing that made Javert kill himselfI've never been to a Starbucks that accepts contactless payment. Always have to pay with the barcode in their appI’m sure you changed his mind and he got a free drink Not to mention the old man was in a Starbucks... the McDonald’s of coffee in the world. Not like it’s a bad place to be but he could be supporting something local instead of judging someone else in line.I think McCafe is the McDonald's of coffee literally speaking.How dare you not shuffle change through your wallet/purse until you find the exact amount and take up more time in the queue! You darn youngin! I'll never understand why older generations feel such a hatred towards technology. Maybe it's just because they're frustrated that they don't understand it? Or they're jealous that they didn't have it when they were younger?Kill 'em with kindness indeed. Naw. He’s what’s wrong with America because he’s a generalizing judgmental old man. Not all technology is “evil” and a bane to our society. Apple pay and the apple watch are not what’s “wrong”. Maybe Facebook/Snapchat is...maybe dumb social media trends are...but not a damn payment system.\s\sBtw to the people who call BS...My uncle in law literally says shit like this. And knowing him he’d probably tell it to someone he just met.r/yeahthathappenedBrilliant absolutely brilliant wrong in the sense of consumption frenzy?I don’t understand senior resistance... why should I handle dirty ass-pennies instead of just waving my electronic device.\s\sIf they’re so so traditional why don’t they pay in precious stones metals and pepper/salt.This made me cringe If it prevents you from receiving monies with germs Now it's his fault too! Smart Watch.Ehh in the sense that the rapidity with which global hypercapitalism is changing our lives and society there's an argument to be made that people who embrace its cutting edge represent the fruition of some of the darker aspects of the global supply chain but manhattan will be underwater in 50 years so thankfully well all be dead Yay!That didn't happen Lanie. Trivia question Why do you think they would say that? Old man - ""I am confusion""""Ameryka explain!

\sI never understand how to pay for the person behind you? Like I don’t know what they ordered yet!can this be counted as [/r/HumansBeingBros](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros)? She did notYeah huh! I was there! I stood up and clapped.How are you so nice? I would have punched him except I'd probably go to jail so I'd imagine it in my head ;_;That kind of sounds like a that happened but idk I’m tired and grumpy r/chaoticgoodThe future is now old man!His reaction must've been priceless.""I am afraid of your world so I will.... attack it.""\s\sFight of flight.I can't begin to wrap my mind around how that could be conceived as bad. I need an explanation.Thumbs up.Did everyone clap after?Ye probSo paying for your coffee is bad? Would he rather you steal it?  In all seriousness though people criticizing things they don't understand is an ACTUAL problem in America.  So many wrong things in America/the world but his problem is people paying for their coffeeHackedI recently had a kid say he hated me because I used cash to pay for a soda.you should have busted out your checkbook for it""You're not my real dad!""I get pretty bitter when I'm trying to get through line and the women in front of me whips out that fuckin checkbook and painstakingly writes it out. \s\sAnd you're lucky if she doesn't start balancing it mid way through writing the check ""so she doesn't forget."" \s\sAnd then she looks at the 5 person deep line behind her and apologizes for being old fashioned as if it's cute. \s\sBut oh no she misheard the cashier and didn't actually look at the total so she wrote 136 instead of 146. so she has to write another one. \s\sand then the cashier has to go show his manager real quick. You should have bought him oneHe's the antithesis of that Granpa. For every Yin there must be a Yang. I'm a kid and i prefer when people pay with cash. Counting change is way better than awkwardly staring at them while they wait for their card to be processed. Okay noob question: how do all these Apple pay Google pay things work? Also why don't I ever see it happen in real life do most machines not support it?[deleted]Basically I hold my phone or watch near the credit card machine when it asks for a card and they transmit the info wirelessly.\s\sIt’s linked to a default credit card but that’s easy to change.\s\sYou may have seen it in real life and not noticed it would just be someone holding their phone next to the machine.[deleted]It's matter of time like any other big tech takes time to be accepted and to spread around the world. And it works with NFC on your smartphone by what I know.Samsung Pay is different in that it uses a magnetic field read by the magnetic card reader that you'd swipe your card through so you can use it at just about any terminal. You don't live in a major city I've never seen them eitherI've never seen it here but when I was in England last year I was literally holding up every line I was in because I had to have my card swiped then sign it or enter a pin. \s\sMeanwhile everyone else would tap their card and walk away. They were so shocked that the US doesn't have this technology. Visit Australia. Literally everywhere. I used to have an Amex they had RFID pay in it. And a discover card too. Shit and a Visa or MasterCard. \s\sBut with the phones even McDonald's has them. If you see a WiFi looking symbol on the card reader it can accept tap pay. \s\sFor phones you add the card to your phone and the card now exists virtually. You can thing select your wallet on like the iPhone or bring it up from the lock screen and you hold it close to the card reader. In china they have nailed cashless payment pretty good by now https://youtu.be/gysKE3POUv0 (please watch it i just spent 10 min searching for it) its one of the reason why i love vacation in china while not everything is perfect about this system and there are some big flaws it does make life a lot easyerIt’s a chip in the phone like in any chipped cards that you just wave in front of the payment screen. It’ll either use your face scanner finger print or passcode depending what version phone you have. I never saw it until I started working retail. Then I saw it once. Granted I've seen more old people write checks than anywhere else so it's probably where I'm working.You tap your phone/watch/NFC enabled card against the card reader and that's it! A lot of big grocery chains accept it in the US. I feel like if I tried this in the UK I’d get my ass knocked outAt least contactless payment is the norm in the UK. (Though I assume you have your fair share of resistors as well)Apple pay is a lot less convenient than just having cash.How so? If the store accepts it the entire transaction only takes 5 seconds. No fumbling with change no taking out your wallet no waiting for change or possibly losing change later. Contactless payments seem to be the most convenient way to pay just given their speed. \s\sJust place your phone wait 2 seconds for the ding and you're done.Right and this asshole probably paid with a check and you’re the problem...ApplePay is the best thing since sliced bread.Then he had a heart attack cause of coffee and you killed him with kindnessPassive-agressive is the best aggressive.Chaotic goodEveryone clapped. *The future is now old man*Hmmm...\s\sAssuming this is a real story which I doubt because anyone that cantankerous to say something like that would never have accepted that the object of their hate paid for their anything how do we know what the ""old guy"" was upset about?\s\sA more interesting story here is what everyone reading the tweet is projecting onto it.And they all started clapping.Yeah maybe kind but still an idiot overpaying for phones and coffee... How does that work though? Was he behind her in line and did she have to wait for him to order? Was he at the register next to her? Surely he could just refuse to let her pay for him?\s\sSomeone please explain I've never been to Starbucks.I dont know if starbucks does this but some places you can ‘pay it forward’ so someone else (usually homeless) can order something that is usually like a sandwich or a basic coffee. Assuming the old man hates customized drinks just as much apple watches she could have just told them to charge like 2-5 buck for the old guy.\s\sThat or this story could be horse shit who knows. I think with the watch if you pull up the apple pay option it automatically finds the card reader. So if she was still standing by the register while they were having this conversation and she was still close enough to the card reader to have her watch still function she could have just tapped and paid once the total came up. For starters it didn't happenThis guys asking the real questions here. I was trying to play the scenario in my head too. Well I mean it's made up. They just left off the part where everyone clapped.\s\sNo one is saying that Apple pay is what's wrong with this country.Have you ever been In a line? Legit just quit working there but they could probably just stick around and pay for it or possibly order him a coffee or something and then the barista could just make the drink. In drive through we have a lot of people who pay for the person behind them but never really at the register It never happenedIf you just stood there when he orders and then put your phone up to the NFC reader you could use the Apple Pay > Someone please explain I've never been to Starbucks.\s\s/r/starbucksShouldn’t he be at the gas station or McDonald’s?I just discovered this feature on my watch and I melted down from happiness when it worked. What a hater!alrite everyone start killing everyone with kindness. start off by giving me a million dollars. oh yeah fuck yallI said you wave it in front of the screen and it registers it.Mad ladHe was probably going to pay with a check.“Wholesome” done out of complete spite. It doesn’t warm my heart. \s\sYou know it’s so twisted like it makes her feel better about herself so she can go the rest of the day not feeling like somebody was rude to her but instead that she’s better than him.\s\sE: it’s passiveI gotta admit I get a real kick out of wholesome spite.

Apple where child slavery is...what child slavery?A majority of younger people tend to be way nicer and forgiving (restaurant work). Although ""older"" folks are equally as nice just in a different sense. There will always be ""that person"" in situations. People have bad days or experiences that cause certain behavior kill em with kindness or try and change that perspective. Bottom line don't let people get to you negativity only affects you if you let it.How did she pay for it when he didn’t order yet????Top ten anime plot twistsSick burn :)Oh no was the coffee too hot? I'm sorryWhat a time to be alivePlot twist: The old guy just wanted a coffee and start a conversation 🙂Doesn't make you any less of a problem.And everyone clapped.I always want to use Apple Pay but never remember to at the register. I don’t even know which stores use it. If they accept tap they accept Apple Pay as it uses the same system. Same for google and Samsung Pay.As someone who works retail I would argue the exact opposite. The difficulty elderly people have with technology and new forms of payment combined with their insistence on using slown and outdated forms eg fiat and checks does nothing but slow down every check out line ever. We're in a time of regular change in tech. I wonder if the younger generation will just take stuff in their stride more as they get older?And time is money and money is god so old people are satan.\s\s-AmericaWholesome as fuck but how the fuck is using contactless payments ""what is wrong with America"" I want to see him explain his logic if there is any.\s\sIt reminds me of a story I heard on /r/unitedkingdom where someone paid for something with chip and pin and said to the person ""When we finally leave the EU we will go back to using ***real*** money [pounds shillings and pence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd)!""Probably the best FU you could have done.

That Larry he's always bustin' our balls so we told him to put a cork in it.Narwhals Narwhals swimming in the ocean causing a commotion cuz they are so awesome. What would his wife sayLove this ❤️Why am I laughing at the name Larry?NawwwwwNow I wish Startide Rising had narwhales in it!This made me smileHis friends just pranked him because he will never be able to get that cork off his unicorn horn. Then he will die in the future because he couldn’t defend himself. Ultimate prank.I love this comic but please credit the artist Liz Climo. She is amazing and she deserves it.Thanks for crediting the artistPictures like this help me get through the day. Larry should try his ~~hand~~ flipper at pool or billiards.r/aww[deleted]I didn't see them shucks. must be a repost. a nice message being saddled by a karma whore. makes me sad again.We facebook now boys.\s\sThis is so sad can we get an upvote?Get used to it. Reddit is the new Facebook.This is some r/ComedyHomicideWhat emojis???\s\sOh I see. I don't think I even registered them until your comment.[deleted]Still unfair and extremely difficult for the poor guy to fit in.This is so cute lolI thought they were gonna tell him to put it in his blow hole so he cant go up for air :( Wow! Very inclusive. Talk about reasonable accommodation I love dolphins 😣This is so adorableThis is basically the exact feeling I had when I was at a party and my weirdness and social awkwardness was making me totally shut down and just miserably sit in a chair perfectly still with my eyes closed and a friend of my just casual sat in front of me leaned against my legs and started having a friendly conversation with someone. Like just that little move to include me despite my social weirdness meant so much to me.I freakin live for this artist's comics. By far the most wholesome thing I've seen all week.Do you have a link?This is nice but these usually aren’t memes this subreddit should be called like wholesome pics. This is like a comic. Stop saying meme it physically disgusts me. You all are disgusting. Cringey He looks so happy :)this makes me smileAwe this is the cutest thing I've seen all day! This adorable. Dolphins can be creepy sometimes but adorable anywaysAs an aside: I think it is absolutely crazy that Narwhals *exist*.What you should find even crazier is that they don't have a *horn*. It's a tooth.I...really didn't believe that they did. And not just for a little bit but for *years*. I thought they were an internet invention created for funny and cute memes. \s\sMy best friend said something about narwhals one day and I made fun of it joking how obviously they weren't real. Then he claimed they were and I just assumed he was setting me up to look like a silly idiot in front of other people someday so I *still* didn't believe it.\s\sI legitimately didn't even believe it when he showed me an image search. He had to pull up the Wikipedia page and let me verify it was both real and not recently edited.\s\sI felt so absolutely dumb yet also overjoyed that such a ridiculous and funny and unique animal was real. Unicorns might not be real but the unicorns of the sea sure are.As a narwhal reading this comment really struck me... :')Oh shit.  To this moment I always thought it was just some imaginary animal made up by a redditor.I’m very real excuse me\sTo this day my mom still thinks that narwhals are fictional creatures. I've tried convincing her multiple times but she thinks all the photos I show are photoshopped 😑Well I mean they are sea unicorns after allI honestly didn't know they were a real thing until I saw an episode of Futurama that had one and I looked it up.My English teacher legit thought that narwals were ""mythical creatures"" and didn't exist.I know! It's like a mermaid mixed (roughly) with a unicorn!They bacon at midnight.I remember in 10th grade when I informed my math teacher that they are not mythical creatures Yeah I doMy brother’s former girlfriend thought they were fake. Made up. Narwhals are not real....\sThey are Totally *FICTIONAL*\sI am tired of the conspiracy. Has anyone ever seen a Narwhal?\sThey're mythical like Unicorns or Griffons. They are imaginary.  .\sI don't understand why people perpetuate this false narrative about their existence. SMH.I found out the other day it’s my school mascot Adorable See all that rubbish in the ocean come in useful occasionally Ruined by emojis and stealing without shouting out OCThose are some pretty nice friends Larry got there.Hahaha\sI couldn’t understand why this was funny till I scrolled down and saw that there was a second frame!After a shit day I love going on this subreddit Very wholesome since as a general rule you just don’t let ‘em touch your balls.

This also seems like a good opportunity to teach empathy/compassion to the older sister.But what is the icon under the word ‘My’?! I’ve seen this a few times and I feel like I’m missing a part of the Internet for the first time in my life...This is interesting because I don't think the baby even understands that it's different. I could see if the little girl needed the helmet and she didn't want to feel weird but the baby doesn't know. Shout out Shea Serrano he’s a great writer and he done loads for the Hurricane Harvey relief \s\s[](https://m.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Shea-Serrano-and-his-followers-raised-more-than-12167851.php) Such a good family as a guy that had to grow up with a helmet when I was super young I can tell you that something like this will let the little guy know he will have people who care about him through his entire life even if he can’t remember it.I'd agree if they weren't making the kid needlessly wear a helmet At least the baby is already wearing a helmet when it falls off that table I wore a helmet as a baby after recovering from my surgery for craniosynostosis. My parents and siblings put a lot of stickers all over the helmet.My baby just had surgery for metopic craniosynostosis! What kind were you diagnosed with? If you don’t mind sharing how is your head these days? The head shaping helmets are a huge scam. Unless you leave your child on their back all the time (that'd be the shitty parebts out there that i doubt care to get the helmet in the first place) then they will out grow of and irregular bumps and flat spots. Whenever I see them I just think helicopter parents.

Can you turn a babies head into a square?[removed][removed]A dad trying to normalize something for his family and other families is a wimp?But a baby won't ever feel self conscious.I mean it's kinda fucking stupid - babies don't grapple with social embarrassment. El homie Miklo.u/SheaSerranoHey. That's a guy that does stuff.This is sweet and all but it'S not like the baby will even realize that others are also wearing a helmet. Or that he'd remember anything.Baby is more prone to accept wearing a helmet and not kick a fuss if they watch their loved ones also wearing them. They're like little monkeys copying. We taught our kiddo a similar way to get her medicines. They might not remember anything but they still know something's going on.No but it’s good to make people think about shit like this.That kids gonna grow up believing that everyone wears odd headgearImagine how weird it will be to meet bald people!Good thing they put that helmet on him because his baby chair is about to fall off that table. that’s adorable. but I doubt the baby understands any of it... good lesson in kindness for the older kid though. [deleted]I imagine it normalizes it for the siblings too.This reminds me of when I went to an elementary school that had a pretty strict uniform code.  One of the third graders was diagnosed with cancer and had to stop attending for a while for treatment.  Before he returned the school changed the dress code to allow anyone to wear a hat.   A few of his friends shave their heads too.  I remember being stoked that I got to wear my fishing hat to school. They always safeTIL those are to shape the kid's head. Huh.Good father making his daughter feel normal. In a decade they can look back at the photos and laugh.Shea Serrano is one of my favorite humans>My cousin's baby\s\sIsn't that just his niece Your niece is your brother/sister’s baby. Not your cousin’s baby. it's first cousin once removedThat's called real loveNow that's reposted.Go Shea making it big on Reddit Meanwhile baby balances on the edge of the table. Perhaps they all sit in high chairs so the kid doesn’t feel different there too. Dang just born and already self conscious. What a world we live in. Except the baby isn't gonna know he's different nor will the helmets on dad & sister do anything to make him feel better. This is completely pointless.The baby can't even be more than 6 months old... I would get if the kid was like 2+ years old.. at least by then the baby might be slightly self conscious... but now? Fuck that.Head shaping helmet? Shea Serrano is one of the best Twitter follows out there. I've heard those helmets have almost no effect on head shape.You've heard of one poorly conducted study.Just curious. What medical condition would cause a need for a head shaping helmet?[Here](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Baby-Helmet-Therapy-Parent-FAQs.aspx). Cranium malformations are relatively common on a large scale. \s\sThe helmet doesn’t hurt the baby it’s equivalent to wearing a torso brace for scoliosis. Annoying but not painful. My baby has a condition called metopic craniosynostosis which is sometimes treated with a helmet. She was born with her metopic ridge fused which caused her forehead to grow into a triangle shape. We opted to have a cranio vault reconstruction and front orbital alignment surgery to avoid the helmet therapy and not risk the ridge becoming fused again. She had her surgery yesterday and is currently in PICU healing. My ex husband's parents didn't like the shape of his head so they tied a bandana and the back of his head became flat something he was incredibly self conscious about. :/ they needed this helmet I guess. Cone headI used to ride a bicycle everywhere.  Every time I walked out of any building I'd put my helmet on (because my bike would be locked up right there).  Then I upgraded to a motorcycle and again every time I walked out of a building I'd put my helmet on (because my bike would usually be parked close but not as close as my bicycle would have been).  Then I upgraded to a car and it felt so weird to walk out of a building and not even have a helmet to put on.\s\sAnyway that guy cooking is either wearing a helmet slightly too small or doesn't have it sized correctly.  It should fit farther down on his head.  If he goes to any bike store they can probably help him size it correctly.a nice gesture but I don't think that baby's old enough to be self-conscious about thatI first read this as “head slapping helmet” and I was deeply concerned as to why a child would need that. \s\sI’m reading too fast these days. They safe af thoughYour tinfoil contraption has never been more obsolete.\s\sOh ya?\s\sSkullcap on.\s\sWatchu gon do now?\s\sAimmadahmahhair\s\sWeebs....Better than the whole family wearing diapers or breastfeeding in solidarity. Or is it?why is there a emoji under the first word Yeah i saw it to. ♨️This is literally all I care about in life at this moment.The looney in my hometown never took his bike helmet off. He was sure the sky would fall down on him if he ever removed it. Children where perplexed. Parents loved him. He was the perfect scare. “Remember to put your helmet on or you might crash get brain damage and never remove it.” \sHe was the sweetest guy and a gift to the community. I understand if it’s a kid but it’s a baby.This is pretty off topic but that bicycle helmet looks like it would do fuck all if he landed anywhere besides the very top of his head. What if he falls backwards hitting the back of his head? Dead. Forwards? Face is fucked. Sideways? Still pretty bad. Upside down on top of head? PERFECT My little brother had to wear one in 1999 when they weren’t as popular. We live in Dallas and that year the Stars won the Stanley Cup so my parents decorated my brothers head-shaping helmet to look like a Stars helmet. My parents were accused of being irresponsible for making a baby wear a hockey helmet in the summer in Texas. Now we see these helmets all the time!\s\sEdit: My brother in his helmet (https://imgur.com/gallery/9L6rA) \s\s[deleted]Ed Belfour was on fire throughout the playoffs that year. he shoulda won the Conn Smythe imoAs soon as I saw ‘In 1999’ I thought oh fuck I’ve been bamboozled. Shittymorph has destroyed my trust. What's with the head shaping helmets these days? They seem way more common than they used to be. Are babies born with more disformed skulls these days? Or are parents just easier to convince that there baby is going to suffer if their head is slightly lopsided? When I was 9 I got a hole in my head. I had to wear a hockey helmet for a year. My parents bought my brother and sister hockey helmets to wear while riding bikes so I wouldn't feel so out of place.What is the head shaping helmet for?Statistically speaking if you wear one on a bike you should wear one walking and driving. They are all kind of dangerous.\s\sThis scene should be a norm.

To make the baby not feel stupid? The baby don’t care[deleted]Did your brother get better? No child should ever have to go through that.I’m entirely uncomfortable with how precariously close to the edge that child is. That stretcher should be on the ground not on a table.

The little girl will scream in case of emergencyYeah what kind of seat is that and why is it on the table? She looks like she’s at least 4 years old she’ll be fine. She’s not an actual baby who can’t hold herself up at all. The title is misleading calling her a baby.

That's definitely a baby.omg lmaoMy cousins baby got cancer so guess what I got for my whole familyShaved heads!Why? It's a baby. It's not like he's old enough to realize what he's wearing and experience embarrassment.Breaking character but c'mon with the title man.I work for a portrait studio. My first holiday season I had a family in doing photos and the baby had one of these helmets on. While I get Mom and daughter set up Dad kneels down to the baby sips of the helmet for the photos and says very quietly.\s\s""Ok Magneto we are going to take off your helmet now so Profesor X may be able to find you for just a few minutes but we'll be quick.""Safety first! cringed at ""realist shit""\s\s\sshut up you don't know what real is.\s\s\son the plus side good on dad making the baby feel normal.\s\salso whats a head shaping helmet do?This guy is soooo nice and good.

Cool guy. #FOHArmy we out herePlus he's MikloI wrote him a fan letter on behalf of my SO and he sent him back a letter and a really cool bookmark. We have his book! I can confirm I’ve emailed him about writing a few times and he’s always responded.It took me three tries reading this to realize the title said head **shaping** helmet not head **shaped** helmet. I kept thinking “aren’t all helmets head shaped?”Wearing a helmet in a car reduces your risk for a head injury more than wearing one on a bicycle.People don't understand just how dangerous cars are. Really?Awwww that's so great!Life's a risk.[deleted]Although baby seems to be sitting precariously close to the table edge.  What does this have to do with turning a baby into alcohol?Looks like Kenneth Kennison finally turned his life around. Do babies get self conscious?\s\sNo. No they don't.I keep trying to put into common practice the walking/all the Time helmet but nobody is on board. My six year old does it with me but I don’t think all of you really can get down with this level of confidence me and my dude have.i read this as being about the cousin so i thought everybody was was wearing it  becauase the cooking man in the red helmet was wearing itWait so Is it to show his baby support? Cause honestly that baby is too little to give a shit. Lol\sShea Serrano is a national treasure.i don't think this is a meme\s\sare we even aware of what memes are anymore?\s\sare we all normies? \s\shave normies taken over this site?Wholesomeness mostly overrides other concerns here.I'm not reading through to see if anyone already mentioned it but - Shea is one of my favorite sportswriters ever and if you reallllly want some wholesome stuff google all the money he's raised for so many random causes.  He calls it the FOH (fuck outta here) army and he sends out free bookmarks and stuff to us/the army/whatever you want to call it and ""members"" just donate little bits (that end up in six figure amounts) to whattever seems helpful. He also is a ny times best selling author and people buy 10+ copies of his books at a time donating/gifting the extras.  He's the man.Eh the baby doesn't know the difference so he's really just doing this for his own attention/internet points.My boyfriend jokes that I need a helmet because I hit my head kinda often. He said he will help me decorate it though.\s\sGood on that family for being supportive. 😄I’m a firm believer that approximately 90% of the times these helmets are recommended or prescribed it’s bullshit.\s\sThat said kudos to this papa for making his girl feel cool in her helmet.Based on what? I have two kids. Both ended up in helmets when all the ""avoid a flat spot!"" hot tips failed and then the subsequent ""Fix a flat spot without getting a helmet!"" ones did too. \s\sSome kids are just more prone due to a variety of factors. The size of the baby at birth how fast they grow how well they sleep how stationary they sleep if they had low muscle tone if they have any issues with their sutures if they have tight neck muscles if they were preemie or twins or otherwise experienced a restricted uterine environment etc. \s\sLots of these helmets aren't covered by insurance so I doubt people are clamoring to cough up $2-5K if there's an easier faster simpler solution at hand.\s\sNewborns sleep 15+ hours a day. It's hammered into new parents' heads that ""back to sleep"" in a room-sharing (but not bed sharing!) environment preferably with a firm as hell mattress and no pillows or blankets is the safest way to go based on all the current research with SIDS and suffocation deaths. \s\sAnd since the 1990's when this became the norm flat spots have become increasingly common (one study I read said it was something like 40% of babies now have at least mild positional plagiocephaly.) Can it be avoided or fixed without a helmet in many cases? Sure! But I doubt it's 90% avoidable. And in cases of moderate or severe flat spots good fucking luck.\s\sYou can do tummy time or hold them upright every minute their eyes are open but if they just so happen to have an unfortunate mix of one or more of the above risk factors chances are decent they'll get at least a little flat spot and once one forms they tend to lay on it and it gets harder and harder to move them off and have them stay off.\s\sThere are ways to try to avoid and counteract it but they don't always work and time is not on your side when it comes to sutures closing and skull bones hardening so if things aren't improving by 4-6 months your options are helmet or hope it gets fixed with the things that aren't currently working by around 12-18 months because after that your window to act has passed and what you see is what you get.\s\sI've seen school aged kids with wonky heads that are way too late to fix now. I'm glad I didn't leave it to chance when months of ""repositioning"" wasn't doing shit for my kids but weeks of wearing the helmet changed their shape significantly. We tried it all. Head shaping pillows constant tummy time chairs to sit them up to keep them from lying down or rolling over when awake head massage moving them into different positions while sleeping etc. \s\sAnd the hilarious part is the pillows and positioners aren't generally safe for sleeping! So you either try to find the lightest most breathable mesh options (surprise they are expensive!) and risk a less than optimally safe sleeping environment killing your infant or you do the recommended back to sleep with no soft mattresses or pillows thing and hope it doesn't fuck their skulls up too much resign yourself to paying for a helmet or spend every waking moment doing all you can to keep them off their heads even if it makes them miserable. Or both if you're me! Fun choices all around.\s\sWorst case with the helmet it doesn't work and your kid still has a weird head but hey at least you tried everything.\s\sWorst case without the helmet your repositioning methods don't work and your kid still has a weird head but you never know if a helmet might have worked and now it's too late.\s\sYeah fuck that slap a helmet on if you can afford it. 10/10 fixed both my kids up when nothing else worked. \s\sWith my son I hemmed and hawed and was so sure we could fix it on our own then he started getting older and time for the helmet was running out. Got him in it and 9 weeks later he was all done and looking great.\s\sWith my daughter I used everything I learned with my son and was determined to avoid her even getting the tiniest of flat spots to begin with!\s\sYeah that didn't work because she had torticollis. After months of PT we got her in a helmet and even though we started earlier with her she ended up needing two different helmets to get her where we wanted her \s\sSo you can do everything ""right"" and know all about the risks and do tummy time till the cows come home or discover and treat a tight muscle immediately and still end up needing a helmet if you want to see actual results.\s\sMaybe we just make extra soft skulled kids? All I know is the back to sleep campaign has saved lives but it's fucking up kids' heads too. Maybe we need to find a better method that still reduces SIDS without messing with our babies' skulls as much. Yes it's possible to fix a flat head and you can't fix death but insurance companies are getting less and less likely to cover it as it becomes more common and not everyone has the cash to get their kids looking normal enough to wear glasses or bike helmets in the future.\s\sI would have loved it if it hadn't cost $7500 lifetime (one $2500 helmet for my son two for my daughter) to fix my kids' heads. But it did. I did not rush into the helmet fix willy nilly. My son's flat spot was on the high end of mild but in a really obvious spot so unless he grew long hair it would have been visible as an adult. My daughter was more asymmetrical due to the neck tilt and she looked less flat but was actually in the severe range for width to length ratio. I think her head shaping pillows kept her from getting that ""belt sander accident"" flat area at the expense of putting more diffuse pressure over a wider area and making her skull incredibly wide instead.\s\sNo amount of tummy time was fixing that. But gentle counterpressure from the helmet started working immediately.\s\sIt is what it is and in the end we fixed the problem so it's all good. But I still get pissed when I see people saying that helmets aren't necessary they don't work time would fix it on its own all these helmet babies must be left neglected in a playpen all day etc.\s\sNo. You have no idea. Some kids just get flat and it can't be avoided. Tummy time is not a magic cure-all. Helmets at least the active ones (Doc band Starband) with competent orthotists and parents who adhere to the wear and adjustment schedules work great. And in many cases they work fast. \s\sI have scans and photos of my kids heads throughout the process. It's not wishful thinking or woo or taking advantage of dumb parents. It's watching your kid's head get progressively worse as you desperately try anything at your disposal and they get increasingly mobile so ""any minute now it'll start to get better! Oh wait it's not? Hmm..."" Then it's watching your kid's head start to smooth and round out the very first week in a helmet.\s\sShit works when all else fails. Nobody ever pressured me into getting one. It was always the last ditch effort. But damned if they don't do the job. I just wish our insurance covered it.[deleted]If they happen within 5 miles just move 6 miles away. Still in the area just in a much safer environment.I've found a value to convert:\s\s- 5.0mi is equal to 8.05km or 42257.22 bananasThis stat and it's cousin; most car crashes happen within 5 miles of home have always bugged me.\s\sThe stat I found says 52% of car accidents happen within 5 miles of home but I'm willing to bet that on average more than 52% of *driving* takes place within that five miles. Even if driving 10 miles at least half of that trip  took place within the 5 mile limit. \s\sI think the stat implies that the 5 miles closest to home are safer than the rest. \s\sSorry for the rant just always bugged meWhere else would people be having sex at if not at home?I’m inclined to think a majority of those accidents even occur within the home. Yes people that run your car through your garage walls I’m talking to you....Both of mine were.

That baby seat is too far off the edge of that table. What is a shapping helmet ? It's bsThose head shaping helmets are a giant money making scam that takes advantage of nervous scared and tired parents. It's total bullshit. We did this in elementary school when a girl had a brain tumor and had to wear a hat everyone wore hats.This is sweet and all but it'S not like the baby will even realize that others are also wearing a helmet. Or that he'd remember anything.\s\sMy family still laughs about when I had to wear it as a child.\s\sNot like I almost died or anything...Awesome familyAyeee milkweed!!SHEA getting some love outside r/NBA. Love it!And here I am just finished reading Shea's article about disrespectful dunks which are not wholesome to say the least.Nice try Coneheads.  Órale Milk WeedI wonder what kind of dormant fetishes this will create in this kid. Can’t wait to check back in 15 years and find out. Fetishes are generally set from ages 6 to 10. When my parents first got married they lived next to a couple that had a new born baby and they would play with the babies soft head and try to shape it. Really weird shit.[deleted]Vatos locos forever ese This is so cute. Maybe if I wore one of those as a kid I'd be able to fit my giant head in a normal sized hat and glasses... Eh whatever I'm not a hat person anyway makes my head feel gross and sweaty.[deleted]I work in healthcare they are thousands if dollars for cosmetic reasons. I hate this stuff so much.\s\sThat's what I'm saying! I can almost guarantee that the little girl was the one who encouraged the helmet wearing. She probably wanted to match the baby and then forced the dad to wear one too. \s\sSource: am the parent of a bossy toddlerSweet little baby r/wholesomefaketextsGood to see the wholesomeness Shea Serrano exudes extends to his extended familyFOH Army!Wholesome family safety practice right here!Oh wow[deleted]Exactly what I was thinking.m0RP;CzE*1[Z>wC>yTgulKl]EtDO~x2i@vhI'm guessing their little daughter got jealous that the baby got a helmet and wanted everyone to wear one.If that heavy headed toddler+ keeps sitting like that she's going to need one for real.why the balls is the hot spring emoji in the middle of the text what is going on hereShea Serrano is a national goddamn treasure.

I always thought it was so they wouldn’t smash their heads into things due to mental retardation Wholesome but the baby won’t remember a thing about this and if the parents try to make the world fair for her every step of the way then she won’t know how to endure hardships and rise above. It’s not about the kid though it’s about the upvotes right?Even better your protected and whenever anyone comes to your door it looks like you were going to go out for a bike ride. Maybe I should just start wearing a helmet.Wait do families actually do this? go through weird shit together in some act of solidarity? Is this normal?

Kudos on the wholesomeness but I'm pretty sure head shaping helmets are another American thing that's generally accepted as useless and a waste of money in the rest of the world.When I was a little kid I had to wear a helmet almost all the time because I was so clumsy and was always hitting my head off stuff I feel like the baby doesn't care at all. If the child were a little older and had to wear a helmet that would be one thing.\s\sStill a very positive and happy sentiment though!what is a head shaping helmet? For kids with malshaped heads they wear a helmet that helps round out the skull as it grows and is still soft.My two oldest had to have helmets when they were very young. \s\sTheir heads were misshapen slightly but enough that it would have looked weird af when they were grown. We went to a specialist who would constantly measure their heads to in order to create the correct helmet shape and adjust it over time. They had to wear them about 23 hours a day. you may be interested in this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cranial_deformation  \s  \snot a lot of people know that this existed. google head binding and head flattening.  \s  \shttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Maya_cranial_deformation.gifBabies’ heads are soft until they reach a certain age and some children’s don’t harden and seal on schedule so the kids wear a helmet until it heals up. It’s bullshit. Baby’s heads are often mishappen due to being soft and spending a lot of time on their back. Parents spend lots of money to buy custom helmets to re-shape their heads. There are no medical studies supporting the idea that the helmets are necessary or more effective than simply having the baby spend time on its stomach. How many adult do you know walking around with flattened skulls?\s\s\s*There is a lack of Class I literature evidence supporting the use of helmet therapy in deformational plagiocephaly. There are controversies surrounding the use of orthotic therapy such as appropriate use cost use in older children and long-term outcomes. Clinical indications for orthotic therapy need to be better defined with further research.*\s\sSource: http://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/2013.7.FOCUS13260I imagine it's similar to a pallet expander.

Many cultures have done it including the Mayans. They would use two wood tablets I believe to shape the head of a baby to the desired look.I wish I had oneHe real problem with this picture which no one seems to be mentioning is that that’s clearly not a baby. That’s a toddler and an old one at that. Way to old to be wearing a helmet and her skull is long past being pliableThis is what I call love'What did your parents do that you thought was normal only to later discover that it was not normal at all?'The baby isn’t embarrassed by the helmet... this seems really silly to me though they may be teaching compassion and empathy to their older child and that is certainly worth wearing a helmet around your houseHead shaping helmet? what the hell is that?This baby don't know what's going on and is going to freak when the family doesn't have helpmets on...I’m not gonna lie I didn’t even see the baby at first Kenneth Kennethson!I'd change it up a little.

\sJust so everyone knows the poster of this meme Shea Serrano makes a living on Twitter ripping off other peoples posts as his own. \s\sTheres like a .000000001% chance this is actually his family.Do the kids have to wear them when they sleep too?Yes. Since that's when they're most likely to be getting a flat spot since it's the longest period of time they'll be lying on their backs all day if you follow the latest sleep safety advice.\s\sThey wear the helmet 23 hours a day with one hour off so you can wipe the helmet down with alcohol (to avoid sweat and dirt making it smell funky) and give the kid a bath because the helmet can make them a little sweatierv especially in a hot season or climate. \s\sThen it goes right back on until their next bath or helmet adjustment appointment. This continues until they reach the shape you want or they run out of foam in the helmet. \s\sIn that case you either say good enough and call it done or get another helmet until they reach a normal shape or they outgrow that one.\s\sBoth my kids needed helmets. They didn't mind wearing them at all and slept just fine in them. The fact that they slept like logs come hell or high water was part of the reason they got flat to begin with. You can only move them around in the crib so much and have to sleep yourself sometime.FOH we out hereMy doctor told me that these were proven virtually ineffective. Seemed like a bit of a blanket statement. Anyhow anyone with more knowledge care to chime in on the effectiveness of these devices?Wait.

I remeber when i saw him on californication.

All loveGuy clicking photo is mark zukerberg in jonny sins disguise Marylin Manson and Hugh Jackman. Nice Lol I thought it was Marilyn and RDJ at first.They were on *Californication* together for an episode or twoThat was great! He was being a terrible influence to hank’s daughter. One of my favorite shows ever. At least for the first 4 seasonsI occasionally dream of Californication And worked on the game Area 51 as voice actors. They both had major parts the whole way through the game. Calcium dream \sCalcium dream“I’d be honored if you came and did some narcotics with me” is one of my favorite lines ever in TV. Oh I forgot about that show. I couldn't make it...too depressing every third episode.I just want to watch those episodes. Can I jump right into them or will I be completely lost? Never seen any of the show but I've heard of itI thought this was Californication for a second. The bald guy in the background passes for RunkleThey also provided voice acting for a video game together. They also worked together doing voice acting on the Area 51 game (PS2)Those two look like they could show a lady a good time.Pictures of David Duchovny and Marilyn Manson behind the scenes Californication. \s\shttp://www.duchovnycentral.com/2013/03/behind-scenes-californication-set.html?m=1This but more sadness and cronic unemployment for my friends...Two of my teen crushes together! 😍I saw a friend today it had been awhile...

Most underrated comment.TIL makeup can be a substitute for a jawline. I feel this on so many levels. Friends are great. People are great.

For whatever reason the Eminem lyric ""So they blame it on Marilyn"" randomly popped into my head a couple minutes ago.  I had a few thoughts about him.  Then I picked up my phone opened the Reddit app and the first thing I saw was this photo.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b74fgy9Ea5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b74fgy9Ea5A)Marilyn’s interview about columbine was incredibly articulate and well spoken. I’m constantly impressed with his ability to reason and debate.Where were the parents at?> Baader-Meinhof is the phenomenon where one stumbles upon some obscure piece of information—often an unfamiliar word or name—and soon afterwards encounters the same subject again often repeatedly.\s\shttps://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/we are watching you....SynchronicityIn my head I have a made up storyline where Marylin Manson was really just going through an awkward phase and has grown out of it but still dresses like he does because it’s his professional persona.  He hates getting dress just as much as the rest of us hate wearing a suit to work.Man imagine being Marilyn Mason's mom and still insisting that ""it's just a phase"". He has changed quite a bit and it really has always been a persona for the most part he’s had his addiction issues and can be pretty pretentious at times but his music has definitely changed too.  I have a theory John Elway was gifted hundreds of footballs. He has no place to store them and they end up on his deck in a huge pile. His wife has a party planned and he has to wake up each morning and begrudgingly throw them as far as he can to ready his house. He does it every morning while drinking coffee. And he hates it.Before I started working federal security my old job required me to wear a suit daily but it also had some pretty restrictive guidelines for dressing for executive threat protection/personal protection that I hated: having to wear a poorly fitting sports jacket (they said I had to wear their sports jacket [they would have had no way of knowing if I did or not anyways] which can't be tailored/fitted all that well due to the varrying amounts/types of concealed weapons & equipment that vary from detail to detail). You can only make so many ""outfits"" by varrying your solid color clip on/break away tie collection against either a solid white or solid black tailored button down dress shirt with your cufflink collection as accents so you essentially look the same every day. I always figured that if I ever had a job where I had to wear suits daily I'd get to dress up in a different badass tailored & color coordinated tie/pocket square/vest/dress shirt/jacket & trouser combo each day not looking like Agent 47 every fucking day. I'd rather wear a comfortable uniform & save on my dry cleaning bill versus being limited to an uncomfortable suit that might as well be a uniform since it practically looks the same every day. I was always expecting him to put out an album where he found Jesus played christian rock festivals and toured the talk show circuit begging fir forgiveness for sll the evil he had done and children he lead astray ... Ali G Style\s\s... then have a well-planned public meltdown where returns to MM.I don't wear a suit to work.

I got the Monoprice Maker Select Plus I think which is apparently a reskin of another popular chinese brand and it's been treating me pretty well. You'll have to shop around to see what kind of features/print size you want as well as what materials you want to print with. Alternatively if you just want to print a couple things then it might be better/cheaper to see if a nearby library has a maker space or something like that where you can just use/rent their printer.I would recommend Ender 3. Or just go to r/3Dprinting and look for some recommendations!Creality Ender 3 or Ender 2 are good and cheap. Quite a large community around them too. Don't get an Anet A8.

Im gonna take this post as a good omenso cute heheHow tf do you 3D print woodWhat a great dad that elephant would definitely lift my spirits. They do. I have a little hand carved one made for my father as a child by a Japanese POW here in NZ. They are called ""trench art"" and they used to make them for the guards to give to their kids.  It's a lovely piece and I treasure it. It's a sad little elephant because the man making it probably was sad he couldn't give it to his own children. \s\sI'd like to think that at the very least the granddaughter of his guard places a lot of value on it and thinks about his family and what they would be like. \s\sTrench Art was a form of currency in POW camps. You do the best with what ever skills you have. A friend of mines family damn near came to blows over his will and who got the gloves he had made as a POW. Apparently he was the only one in the camp who knew how to knit so he would find whatever and knit gloves and socks. Socks and gloves were a seriously big fucking deal during a German winter as a POW. Even today the Armed Forces get all bent out of shape about socks. Never wear wet ones. Fold them and make them smiley etc. That would take like 10 hours to print. That's a lot of stressDamn you can 3D print wood nowadays?If you were stressed for the length of time to print that you'd probably commit suicideWhere can I find this model it looks so cute 😱[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:257911) should have it!>3D printed\s\sOkay\s\s>Wooden elephant\s\sHol'upWood infused filament.are you have rarted?This looks like a Labo Elephant.That's pretty cool.

You can sand it paint it etc in ways other plastics don't do so hot.\s\sDownside is that it's a bit finicky to work with.Well it definitely isn't the Fused Deposition Modelling type of 3Dp as you can't melt wood but it could be one of the other 3Dp technologies like Binder Jetting or Selective Laser Sintering of sawdust with an appropriate resin.\s\sI say Wholesome dad is Wholesome. as far as i know it's basically sawdust held together with resin or glue or filament or somethingLooks like a mujirushi knick-knack to meAll wood is 3D printed from the ground up it just takes a long timeI work with 3d printers all the time. There is woodfill filament which is PLA plastic with wood particles in it. I have a roll I print with occasionally it has that woodshop smell when printing. There are other filled filaments too such as carbon fiber and metal.Its probably PLA with sawdust.There's actually a wood filament.I was thinking the same thingStress level: 0%Dude my same thoughtNor did I know it helps with stress at all unless you smash it with a hammer maybe.

\sMerry Christmas nice botNice bot!My younger brother who is almost\s25 still believes in Santa. He is autistic and absolutely loves Christmas so this makes me happy.I wasn’t planning on crying at work tonight but here we are.I’m not crying you’re fucking crying!why is this downvoted lmaoThis post made me happy and revived my faith in people. Take my upvote and my happy tears dear friend.[removed]Wish I could upvote twiceThat's the greatest Santa everWow and now I’m crying 😭 he truly has the holiday spiritDoesn’t fit the subhow..?10/10 best SantaIm so excited for being a santa!Brings tears of joy to my eyes 😊I wish I still believed in Santa.i'm literally crying that's so wholesomeNow this is epicHas disability. Slams head on desk Does anyone else think it would be kinda fucked up if she really posted that on her real twitter? Seems kinda like a made-for-shares post.I think the people who think this only do because that’s what they themselves would do. I see it that a stranger was really kind to her son and she wanted to express that and tell others that kindness truly does matter. Also I didn’t post this for likes. I thought it was truly sweet and a good reminder for us all this season. Even as a soon to be 26 year old that knows there is no Santa part of me inside even as I type this right now wants to go to bed early just like I did as a kid who didn't want Santa to skip me because I stayed up. Hell there's even a part of me that wants to leave milk and cookies still lol.Is he saying Santa isn't real?I mean how many things in life did you actually prove or saw for yourself rather than just take someone's word for it? Santa is as real as anti-matter. You can’t see it but if you want to believe that it’s there because someone told you that then it’s there. Reality is what you want it to be.[removed]She’s also forcing everything political she believes in onto her son. Using him as a tool when telling people he’s “disabled” and still better than you. She’s also taking him to marches he probably doesn’t even understand and has to hold banners with stuff written like “melania blink twice if you need help”. That’s pure selfishness.Who is cutting onions in my bedroom at 1:30??Is your son on reddit? If I could grow a beard I'd totally be a Santa if I couldKeep it going for those who can still afford to believe. I worked in a mall on these sets (Santa and Easter Bunny) for a lot of years. I have plenty stories that really pull on the heartstrings. The guys that play Santa are some of the most awesome people I've ever met.It helps when they only need to work one month a year and are paid $200-$500 per hour. Not trying to dismiss that they're great but it's worth knowing.Do you prefer working with Santa's from the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas or the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas?  From what I understand they are quite at odds with one another. I remember going to a Baltimore mall as kid to see ghetto Santa and I kept on wondering why Santa smelled funny. Turns out Santa was an alcoholic crackhead who was blasted 24/7People that play as Santa are amazing. My old church had a Santa where families couldn’t afford the gifts kids asked for. Parents would let them know beforehand and the Santa would say he’d try his best. We’d raise money for the gifts but if it wasn’t enough he’d write a little note talking about how he wasn’t able to make such a gift. They put so much time and effort into the job and I still appreciate it decades later. Even Billy Bob.. but in a different way. Other than that Santa from Nathan For You. I guess you could still describe him as awesome but in a different way.[deleted]What a legendary Santa. Mall Santas are so much more than just a dude in a suitKing of the Santas This is the most wholesome thing I've seen in a long time. The only thing that could make a wonderful christmas even better is seeing other people having an even more wonderful christmas and this post achieved this.maybe don’t let jack call norad this yearMy ex's grandfather would be a Santa around Christmas. This is something he would do I'm sure. [deleted]When Santa first started out the world was a lot smaller and had far fewer children. The world grew up and before Santa knew it he had to tend to all the boys and girls in the same amount of time.\s\sThat's impossible even for jolly old Saint Nick - so he had to get help. He found the jolliest folk from all over and made them Santa too. Every year they don their best red coats and inspire all the children around them with holiday cheer.\s\s&nbsp;\s\sThe next time you see a Santa at a mall remember: They may not be *the* Santa but their spirits are in the right place and they are Santa nonetheless.\s\sHappy Holidays mate.""a""? Surely you mean ""the"". I saw the most Santa looking man walking out of the shops yesterday. He wasn't dressed up or anything but he just 100% looked like him and had a magical air about him with this twinkle in his eyes. Im in my early-20s and he sort of had me believing in Santa again.those guys don't fuck around. being a santa is serious shit. I’m not crying. You’re crying.My dad used to be Santa for the preschool I went to. Every year he would start growing his beard for it in September and when kids would ask if he was the real Santa he would tell them to tug on his beard.  You know it's not really Santa it's a bunch of elves wearing a suitPraise Santa!This is so adorable but my brain keeps wondering if Jack will ever go on twitter and accidentally see thisIs it weird that I feel like it’s a morally grey area to continue to play into the delusion of a mentally challenged boy? Like the delusion is that Santa is real but the longer you allow him to continue to believe this the worse it’ll be when he finds out and is kinda setting him up for more challenges later in life. \s\sEdit: hit send early. \sEdit: second typo spotted. Kinda what I thoughtYes it's weird you find bringing joy to someone is morally ambiguous.It's Santa...what else would he do other than treat him like an old friend!  Have a good one!Christmas Spirit 100My parents told me santa was the devil. And then i turned out to be dyslexicWhat’s she gonna tell him when he grows up?Ah I love this so much. My 23 year old brother has an intellectual disability and still believes in Santa and something like this would make his day. Brilliant when the magic is still alive My uncle is 33 years old and still believes. He has Down syndrome. He will always believe as in his view of the world everything he sees and experiences is real. And I think it's sweet that that magic will always be alive in him. He gets so happy at Christmas time that his eyes fill with tears and it is the most beautiful thingI'm cryingOh i saw the most bueatiful thing I have ever seen today. I went to a Christmas event where they had an ice skating rink a boy in a wheel chair was being pushed real fast on the ice by a rink worker the sheer joy on his face and laughter had me in tears. I waited with my camera to capture him coming back around again but they never came through. This christmas eve moment will be with me forever very sad I wasnt camera ready never seen joy like that. I know the rest of the year and even the rest of Christmas Day must be tough but to have a child be genuinely excited for Christmas morning/Santa every year for ever must be pretty heart warming. I found out today One of the vendors I use at work has played as Santa in the city’s parade for the last 20 years. And I realized how much better of a man he was than me. I got some work todo. (He said he started doing it for foster children for his wife after she passed away)I still believe in Santa. Same! My Family and I still keep our Santa and reindeer traditions alive and well. Is there a difference between an intellectual disability and a mental disability?Mental disability is sort of an umbrella term. Intellectual disability is just a type of mental disability. Then there's mental illness which is something generally acquired later in life that may or may not be curable and can also be disabling.\s\sExamples...Down Syndrome often causes intellectual disability. Autism is a developmental disability that may or may not come with intellectual disability. ADHD is a developmental disability that generally does not come with intellectual disability on its own. Then depression anxiety...these can be mental illnesses or symptoms of another illness or disability. They can be disabling as well. Schizophrenia...illness also generally very disabling.\s\sFolks from different countries may have different views on this terminology I've noticed but this is my take on it all as an autistic person struggling with mental illness but not intellectual disability. There are two people very close to me who have DS and autism respectively and both are slightly intellectually disabled.\s\sI hope this helps!That looks like MatPatBut that's just a theory. A SANTA THEORY.r/goodsantaThis made my day.  10/10 santaingMy dumb ass read that as sataning and was a bit surprised but then realized I'm just a dumb ass lolIIRC All Santas have to go to Santa school to a certification to be an official Santa.This is sweetThis sub makes me cry on a weekly basis Bit confused shouldnt Santa do sth like this? What's extra special about the note being slipped? Am I missing a different change in lingo he used because the child is special?Dank ""meme"" grandmaLmao[deleted]Guys don't think this should be downvoted tbh I don't agree necessarily it's just an opinionWhat’s the benefit of telling him Santa isn’t real? He’s a 15 year old with the mental faculties of a much younger person. Why do we need to force him to “grow up”?Of course all these pussies on this sub would downvote this comment because it disagrees with their precious feel good opinions ninja voice: ""Now this"" \s*ground start shaking*\s""Is epic""This just melted my heartMy brother has several learning disabilities (one of them being autism) at 20 years old. It makes me so happy to see others get the same kindness as my brother has over the years. This is amazingI CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT IM SEEINGI'm not crying. You're crying! omg he looks so happy :DI want to be friends with Jack! God blessMy mum did something similar to me i was walking through  a shopping centre too cool for Santa. And the Santa started yelling across the square ‘emydoo emydoo I’ve got that Walkman you want on my list’ I freaked right out. How the hell did Santa know my name? And what I wanted. I was 9 but it took till I was 18 till she told me she’d been to speak to him. \s\sAnd Walkmans were THE gift of the early 90’sThis is absolutely sweet. Mall Santas for the most part are extremely sweet and dedicated people. Ill always remember that video of the Santa talking to the girl in sign language and it still makes me tear up.\s\s\sOn the topic of keeping traditions alive for latinos we have three kings day in which we have to leave grass and water for the camels of the three wise men to eat in order to get presents.\s\s\sIm 19 and my sister’s 20 and my dad still makes us go outside to get grass and water for the camels. Makes things so much more jolly for all of us :)I was once a disbeliever- not anymore - this is Santa!Jack howyadoinyaoldsonofabitchGonna do this for my kids even if they arent intellectually challenged... this ought to piss them off properly.Wait a second... did the parent think that Santa was going to drop character in front of every other child there?*this* is wholesome.Love those out there who are Santas. Keeping that Magic alive.A tear came to my eye oh fuck This warms my heart so much. My little brother has an intellectual disability as well as autism. He is 16 but behaviorally is about 4. When people do nice and understanding things it really make our day. I feel we get judged so much that any kindness is so beautiful. I cry just thinking about the little interactions he has had where he isn't made to be the odd one. I truly believe mall Santa’s are complete hero’s at Christmas time they do not get enough recognition for all the amazing things they do and for most of them they take classes and even learn other languages to really make the magic come alive for so many children \s\s\sI thank every single Santa I meet for doing something that seems mundane but is very important to so many This is so great :)My faith in humanity is restored just a little because of this. Thank you Santa. It may just be I’m getting too emotional but damn this made me get all misty eyed.WHO THE FUCK IS CUTTING ONIONS AT AN AIRPORT OF ALL TIMESAirports are places Crazy world lotta smellsHave a safe flightEnjoy your holiday vacationThis melted my heart This is wonderful.my son is 14 and I dont know if he believes in Santa or not because he cant communicate that but [magically] a bunch of presents have been placed under the tree while he is asleep. \s\sbless you and know that we are right there with youI was playing the game humans fall over. I think that’s the name. Anyway while I was playing one of the other players had a Santa skin on. I started getting excited and saying guys it’s Santa Claus he is trying to solve this puzzle with us. Then I’m assuming a 8-12 year old started arguing with me that Santa Claus is not real. I was like “Look he’s right here come help my boy Santa out.” The kid threatened to kick me from the game unless I said “Santa is not real”. I proceeded to say “Santa is real that’s what you told me to say”. He started getting angry and said no that’s not what I said and I said “sorry your mikes cutting out did you say Santa is real?” Then he kicked me from the game.Great job you trolled someone with a mental deficiency. Add that one too the list of accomplishments. Or I guess start the list.I love this so much! You can see the happiness in his face!Excuse me I have something in my eye.I don’t want to sound harsh but surely at some point he needs to go out on his own. Is he going to be doing this when he’s 20 or 30?The first r/wholesomememes post that made me tear up/r/upvotedbecauseautismThat's not right she should have told him Santa was fake a long time ago. The road back to Eden is lit by our own acts of kindness.my heart :)My 21 y/o autistic nephew still believes and I don't have the heart to crush him.I think Santa is real. Maybe not as a magical man delivering gifts but he's still here. Think of the joy you felt as a kid sitting on Santa's knee. Of the excitement you felt when you left out snacks for him. And of the way the season brings us together. Thousands of people a year dress up in red suits and sit with kids to give them that little bit of holiday cheer. And we as people also take more time from our day to help out people who aren't as fortunate. Either giving to toy drives food banks or the bell ringers.\s\sSanta's as real as anyone else is- because we keep him living in our hearts even after we stop believing.I know you all imagined Santa winkingI'm confused because obviously Santa is real.This guy Santa’sI love it. I know I'm late to the game but my stepbrother (aged 32) is basically 8 years old developmentally. This kinda shit just warms my heart. Life is hard.just be as kind and understanding as you can. Merry Christmas.Life is hard and complicated but the niceness of strangers has the potential to name everything seem much brighter. Hope you and your stepbrother have a lovely holiday. Merry Christmas to you!That's not bad.  8 is actually pretty reasonably advanced.  That's old enough to hold a conversation and play video games. fucking BLESS.This is my new response to everythingGod bless people like this! I wish everyone could be like that. that's it im crying.There was a video of Santa greeting him that was posted last week.\s\s[Edit: Not the same kid but just as wholesome](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/a4lb3l/hes_ready_to_meet_santa/?st=JQ37RLPO&sh=4505da7f)I’m not crying shut up you are crying.The Santa that comes to the mall near me remembers all  the names of my special needs clients at the group home I work at. So every year it's ""how have you been this year <name>? You been a good boy/girl?"" Makes most of them super happy. (The others couldn't care less lol)Faith in humanity restored. This is my kind of post. This is so dumb though because OF COURSE Santa is going to keep up his schtick regardless of who is sitting on his lamp. Not necessarily. I'm sure there are more than a few mall Santas out there who would say ""real funny kid"" if a 15 year old showed up to sit on his lap. Plus this way Santa knew his name so he could make the experience even more magical.Dumbledore is Death confirmed.Its not kindness its gaslightingI don't know is this really a right thing to do?This is freaking beautiful. I am so thankful for people like this. That smile is genuine I work with individuals with ID and my one resident (51f) is currently in the hospital. She was so worried that “Santa wouldn’t be able to find her” so I promised her that Santa would find her. Staff brought her Christmas presents to her in the night and left them for her to find in the morning. I can’t wait to see her reaction when she sees that Santa came. Merry Christmas*McLovinThis makes my heart smile <3 :)aaand I'm crying!  this is a massive boost to my faith in humanity.  Merry Hanukkah to all 🕎 Modern problems require modern solutionsBeautiful. Merry Christmas!The way one day all is going to come crashing down... just sayingNot if his disability lasts his whole life which it probably will. I’ve worked with kids like this and they have such pure innocent hearts. I think it’s super awesome what that Santa and mom did.💗💗💗Magic is something we never need to grow out of. I love you all and merry Christmas/happy holidays :) Well I know what I am doing to my friends nowI'm going to start doing this for my totally regularly abled friends.He's paid to be Santa why would you need a paper to ask him to do his job? And then he went online and saw this post by his mum Christmas = ruinedTreating him like a baby is kindness?Depends on how severe the disability is.  It’s quite possible that he has not and never will progress beyond the mentality of a 3-4 year old child.There is nothing wrong with the noble lie.  I say to many that luring has its place and can truly be used for good.  I find this absolutely loved.

Please update.He probably goes to a special education school.More wholesome content I want to see on Christmas morning. Keep it coming Reddit. 👍That’s some grade A Christmas spirit. r/santabeingabrodisabled people: *exists*\s\sReddit: OMG THIS IS SO WHOLESOME OMG UPVOTE UPVOTEIt’s not all just that though. It’s the fact that people are still nice to them. People can be arseholes and it warms a lot of people’s hearts (mine included) to see people being nice to one another despite any differences.I assumed he isn't disabled and this is just a joke tbh.Wait SANTA isn’t real ?!!!This is far past wholesomenessI never even saw this show (too old) and this man's passing hurt me.I was probably the right age for this show when it came out. I just never really got into it. \s\sI still miss him. Same here. I know him exclusively through Reddit's obsession with him but because of that (and my self-destructive tendencies to browse r/all) I found out when he had cancer I found out when he saw improvement I found out when he did an AMA and sang the meme song... And then yesterday I found out when he died. Yet somehow it hit me like a ton of bricks. It's so crazy. But I'm also relatively close to his age and recognize just how incredibly young it actually is just how much more life there was still left to live and it breaks my heart. And I also think about all the people around the world in the exact same situation except without the support of thousands of people on the internet and it breaks my heart even more. Typing this out was a bad choice because now I'm crying about some stupid TV stranger I knew almost nothing about. All of this is just stupid.I’m 31 so wasn’t in the target demographic when it came out — but it premiered right after I dropped out of high school and was completing my GED (the different tests were months apart in my area) \s\sI was flipping through channels and the visual aspect caught me especially cute little Stephanie. I think I watched every day afterward.\s\sThe music was catchy and fun and I think the message was awesome. 17 year old me may or may not have danced around the living room with that show sometimes. Watching clips on YouTube it still holds up.OOFu/ClarkStreetGang1I know its said a lot when one has nothing to say but from the deepest depths of my core  \sOof...Shit. I didn’t know he passed away. I’m gonna have to go cry in my work bathroom for a minute now. What a gem of a guy. I’m gonna miss him so much I found out earlier today and haven't been feeling right since. I watched the show as a teen with my younger siblings and he was always my favourite character. It hurts  but we can take some solace in the knowledge he is no longer in pain. Fantastic man he was RIP.I know. His performance as Robbie Rotten was truly captivating. He was hilarious and awesome and I wish he could have had more time with his family :'(Robbie Rotten used to scare the shit out of me as a kid because of all the prosthetics but he was one of the most wholesome dudes on the internet ever.

\shey.. who's cutting onionsForever number one Honestly the most wholesome meme ever. He took the meme treatment in stride and made it positive. It's very saddening that he passed at such a young age.Damn this is how I found out he died. I thought maybe he was over exaggerating when he said he was ""in a fight for his life"".\s\sRIP Mr. Rotten.I don't remember this meme at all and so I'm wondering is that where most of ya'll know him from? Or did you actually watch the show? I've seen/heard of this show but I thought it was a pretty recent children's show so I doubt many of the people on Reddit watched it as kids. Unless they're still kids. Just curious since this is all the front page has been the past 24 hours.It is so young. Too young.Nearly 2 years on I've yet to see a meme that's genuinely as enjoyable and creative as the edits this one spawned.Rip Robby Rotten\s\s\s\s\s\sNever watched the show but it's so wholesome to see his legacy.You are not my friend my friend. You are my brother my friend.He was the pasha of childhood celebritiesYou were my brother Stefàn I loved your/unexpectedglobaloffensivePapa bicep My captain.

This is going down in history...It's not that wholesome if you think about it this makes it more sad.I think it kinda is like he was ""bad"" but he wasn't really so maybe it's the same with a lot of people.[deleted]A little something more than ""**O O F**"" should be said about the tragic passing of this great manMy friend.Can someone explain this guy's history here?\s\sI've seen Lazy Town a bajillion times thanks to my kiddo but the love for someone from a kid's show on Reddit is bewildering me. \s\sI am missing a lot I believe...He was very memeable and the internet demographic finds him relatable.\s\sAlso the show has been around since 2004 and ended in 2014.  Many of the people who watched it as a kid are now late teens early adulthood the main demographic of Reddit.\s\sAlso the actor is a good person.\s\sIts kinda like people being bummed over Mr Rogers dying.  He was a part of their childhood and a good person.  The guy just played an villain albeit a harmless one but villains can still be adored.""We Are Number One"" became a super popular meme towards late 2017.\s\sStefan was diagnosed with cancer during a similar time period and the Internet raised a lot of money for his chemotherapy.\s\sStefan showed a lot of love to the Internet as we helped him fight his battles a shame to see someone go so young.\s\sFuck cancer.Short version: He had cancer faught it seemed to have beaten it. It came back. It claimed him. \sThe guy was memed a lot and he was okay with it. All in all he seemed like a good person that wanted to bring joy to the people I think it's because his character of Robbie Rotten was so over the top unique hilarious bizarre etc that he became a meme and somewhat beloved by a lot of people. That and he was a nice guy that we all came to care about.Reddit is a hivemind and anything they can ""ironically"" like will be unironically liked soon enough and if it can get karma well it's gonna be everywhere *rampant sobbing*[just leaving this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/997z76/rest_in_peace_robbie/) u/chriscrow3Hi.Come on im just trying to work and look at reddit\s\sNow im sad\s\sHe was such an awesome chap :/ Rest in peaceWhat a good time to be raining into my eyesWhy does cancer kill the nicest people I'm going to cry lost someone very close to me to cancer I'll miss you Stefan you were part of my childhood ♥️Always num🅱️er 1:( Has there been any response from the cast of lazy town? Just curious I understand if they're not public about it though.MY HEARTTTT Remember that episode where the town went to the beach and left Robbie behind? He got so lonely...Stop this is to much Is it really that wholesome?Possibly the most wholesome post hereIt's too early for these kind of feels. i'm already crying :-(“You know I always thought we made the best team.” He comments.\s\sThe glowing sun a crisp circle in the bloody sky illuminated a charcoal black pathway shimmering confidently in splendour. Yet a lone figure’s worn and weary silhouette is all but jarring in my eyes.\s\s“Heh. Well I guess this is the end of the road for me.” The owner of the silhouette smiles. “Looks like you caught me in my escape.” In contrast to his fatigued figure and ragged striped uniform the galaxy-blue glimmer in his eyes seems to reflect an ocean in front of me vast and everlasting. \s\sMy arm bracers seem uncomfortable. I fidget slightly as I try to reposition them. “Not even a goodbye to the others?”\s\s“There’s no need to” he replies. “They need you more than me.”\s\s“You’re just like your name suggests” I smirk. “Rotten to the core. How cruel it will be when the others realise you’ve abandoned them without a trace?” \s\sA chuckle escapes the figure. “Well you’re nothing like your moniker. Sportacus you aren’t being a very good sport now are you?” \s\sHe lets out a hoarse laugh. “Then again who am I to judge? It’s been ten years! I know your temperament inside out - selfless and unwilling to part with those he acknowledges.”\s\s“Look Robbie I-“ Before I can get another sentence out his wilting figure walks into arms reach. My eyes are suddenly drawn to the streaks of grey barely illuminated by the sanguine rays of the sun above.\s\s“Enough. Lazytown will be fine without me.” He smiles as he puts his palm on my shoulder. “Our constant rivalry over the past decade has riled them up inspired them and changed their dull and inattentive lifestyle. My work here is done.”\s\sSomething inside of me snaps. “Isn’t that too much?” I cry out voice louder than intended. “They will never know the goodness inside you Robbie only the shell of a villain you portray yourself to be!”\s\s“And why should that matter?” He interrupts again. “As long their lives are improved whether they see me as a friend or foe I am content.”\s\s“…” I choke out words deep within me. “You know I always considered you a teammate a friend. I’m sure the others back in lazytown did too. When they grow older they will realise. Realise the influence you had on them.”\s\s“Friend huh…” He lets out an amiable smile. “I have no regrets then.” He turns and begins a leisurely stroll back onto the path.\s\sI sigh. “Will we meet again?” \s\s“…” The silence is my only answer.\s\s“Robbie… goodbye.” I try to let out a smile at my teammate’s fading figure. “Remember you will always be the number one here.”\s\sA vibrant laugh echoes in the distance. “No Sportacus as long as you remember me I will always be with you guys.”\s\s“*We* are number one.”\s\s\si'm crying!I didn't even watch the show but this made me incredibly sadF. u/ClarkStreetGangu/clarkstreetgang is Mark Valenti’s account.

Honestly when this show was on the air I legit hated it. If nothing else was on I’d just turn off the tv and go play with toys. But Stefan has been one of the coolest most wholesome guys I’ve ever seen and although Lazy Town just wasn’t a show for me this still really hurt to read.  awh no my heartThis theme actually comes across in the show. It's very clear that he feels somehow outside other and excluded and that drives a lot of his malicious behavioursFAh it's beginning to rain...what a horrible day for it too. He was genuinely the nicest person I have ever seen.I must be too old because I’ve never even heard of this show.

You're doing well.\s\s- Tracy MorganIt kills me that when they introduced all-day breakfast they didn't change to all-day lunch. No quarter pounders before 10:30am even though they can handle cooking breakfast and lunch foods together all afternoon.It's not the whole breakfast menu either. I went just a little too late for the ""normal"" breakfast menu once and was informed that they weren't serving hashbrowns. That was a sad day.Kitchen would not be able to handle lunch during breakfast. It gets extremely busy and hectic and there is no way we will we be able to hand out food fast enough. At my McDonald’s we make the most amount of money in the morning.   \sServing breakfast during lunch is easier because there isn’t a surplus of Egg McMuffins it’s scattered through the day making it easier on us.In Australia we have brekkie all day \s\sAnd we have Big Macs Quarter Pounders and cheeseburgers all day too (yes before 10:30) \s\s;)\s\sedit - spellingAnd some don't do lunch until 11 a.m.  \sFound out when we went through the drive thru at 10:30 exactly on our way out of town to head to my grandparents for X-mas 2 years ago and they told us it'd be another half hourIt's just related to so many things. I'm working at a McDonald's and it's clear to me why there isn't an all day lunch thing. Cooking lunch in the morning needs more ppl but there isn't a high demand on bigger burgers/non-breakfast type of food in the morning it would get a negative hourly income for the restaurant because of the workers' fees. Also there are a ton of stuff behind the scenes which is required to cook normal mcdonalds stuff. It's not worth it business-wise.Exactly. I hate McDonald’s breakfast but I love their burgers. I can’t even remember how many times I’ve rolled up at the drive through looking forward to a cheeseburger and some fries only to remember that it’s still 10am and they’re only serving shitty eggs and rubbery sausage. Yeah strolling into a McDonalds at 5 AM after a night of drinking and only having the breakfast menu available was a bit disappointing the first time it happened to me. A McMuffin is surprisingly decent though. McDonald’s only does like half the breakfast menu all day here. It’s very depressingI managed to drive away the only person I actually ever cared for in my life. I can't stop crying when I'm going to sleep I can't stop crying when waking up I don't think I'm doing any good.Pretty sure that was satireShhhhr/getunmotivatedUnless you're depressed Was depressed for a while recently. Had been suicidal throughout it.\s\sIndeed waking up at all is a good thing and it means you did good enough to keep yourself alive the day before.they only do the good biscuits till 10 though I actually feel quite awful every time I wake up and realize I'm still alive. Never said this before but Thanks Abilify Yeah had some buddies that had bad experiences with the medication abilify I wonder if the person on Tumblr knows of it or just thought it sounded cool.They don't do that here :(You’re doing WELL. The whole plot of Falling Down just fell apartWhat if I wake up dead?[deleted]We have brunchSeriously that's basically all I had to keep me going for a long time.

Same have some friends coming in to town to stay with me for a few days and have been doing some well-needed spring cleaning around the place. It's a chore obviously but it feels good :)r/nonzeroday would welcome and love you Sometimes when I don't get visitors for a while I pretend people will visit me by surprise so I have to be ready and my flat needs to be clean too.Had a very similar experience this evening my friends invited me out and gave me a reason to look nice and presentable. It felt great :)[Tracy Jordan says it best. ](https://youtu.be/rQXYCzOKMoo) Breakfast still ends at 10.30AM here in the UK. Anyone know when they will introduce this? :( This will get me kicked off the sub but doing well*I woke up in McDonald’s once while they were serving breakfast.Not waking up dead is fantastic. 👌🏻If you lay in bed all day you're still doing good . As long as you get enough sleep and relaxing helps you cope <3You're doing well*\s\sSuperman does good. What if I don't want to wake up anymore then getting up anyway means you’re doing great!Then you're a true soldier for continuing to wake up :)You should reach out and talk to someone. Talking to someone qualified to help if you need it isn't a sign of weakness it is just like taking the right tool from the toolbox and using it for its intended purpose.\s\sIf you don't want to wake up any more please reach out. \s\sIf it was just a pun and I missed it eh. Sorry. SameTo make your grammar more wholesome say ""doing well"" instead of ""doing good"".\s\sMy mother’s 98 year old neighbor:  “If I wake up it’s a good day”One of the best lines I heard was from a 87 year old spitfire from Jersey: “Any day I wake up on this side of the dirt I count it as a win.”[deleted]If you're reading this you just had a good day :)\s\sTrue for me and it only just started.Wait hold up. Breakfast all day?Mcdonalds always lowering the barWell someone has to.I feel so much comfort from these low standards. I feel like I'm smashing it.😂[removed]What are you doing here? Wrong place. Go somewhere else to talk about that stuff Dogs are man's best friend again! No I'd be doing good if I didn't wake up today. I'm going to jail for violating rent control.Aww spideybro you can stay for free. :')Is it possible to make the spider pay my rent too? A little out of budget these daysI can't stop laughing That spider is huge then.Aww cute little friendos! Thank you for all you do!Now I feel bad for smashing spiders. :(That's so cute! I imagine the coins could also be dust bunnies paying rent.Thanks you spider bros.This changes my perspective of spiders foreverThis is pretty darn wholesomeNoSpiders scare me and I have been mean to them even recently. But this makes me want to be nice to them this makes me want to be a better person. Happy spido :)Awwwww xD[removed]Don't kill them they just wanna eat some bugs. If you must take them outside in a cup but there's no reason to kill them.This thoroughly improved my day. Thank youMy spiders pay their rent in the labor of eating bugs and of some great Halloween decorations.[deleted]Thanks for taking them out instead of killing them.In my house they don't pay. I never find loose changeEven if they don't give money they still help get rid of other insects!/r/spiderbro ?[removed][removed]Please keep political bait outta this subI need to know who the artist isHere is the full version with watermark from the artist!\shttp://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/856/493/d2a.png/r/wholesomememes or /r/me_irl ??I actually legitimately wish I had a few more spiders to deal with all the fruit flies.\s\sIt seems like no matter how much I clean they just wont go away :cGod damn it! That's why my wallet is empty! Oh wait... I just spend my money on having an amazing time with the best people I know. Or paying tribute so they don't get squished.Them not paying rent was my main reason for killing them... guess ill have to face my fears nowI'd gladly take that money. I don't kill spiders and these guys are living the good life. Ohh if I were a landlord I'd accept that drawing of a spider as payment. Very cute.Relevant song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFnxLrCXhZU\s\s""Spider\sWhy are you hanging around?\sSpider\sWhy are you hanging around?\sGet out of our kitchen\sAnd go get a job.\sIt's not fair\sFor you to live here."" - A Great Big Pile Of Leaves ""Learn to Share""This is adorable but everyone knows that spiders don't use human money. Duh!/r/spiderbrosAs much as I hate spiders... this is adorable. I'm curious do spiders eat ladybugs? A group of them decided to huddle by my window at the start of winter some even getting inside but since this large spider decided to spin a web in the same area I haven't seen a single one.\s\sI'm asking because I've had bad experiences with ladybugs and if this spider bro's been taking care of them then I am eternally grateful.[Spiders are cute](https://youtu.be/HYFQQB9vqPw)Where does the spider get the money though? Does someone else pay them for pest control?Aw little guy you don't need to pay more. You pay your rent by being cute and eating little gnats!!\s\sWhenever we find those little wolf spiders in our house they get to stay. Our son named our most recent one ""Shoe.""That's cute as heck!That's nasty Awww this is adorable. I wish all the spiders in my house paid rent. Even if it wee in small change I'd be loaded.Then I would be killing my tenants.You should sometimes drop cents behind counters and sofas to pay the spider-bros for their services. He might not be your tenant just a housekeeper. But he still has to pay rent to someone.Well that would be more rent than my ex ever paid. /r/spiderbae Maybe those coins are the spider's savings account. If this is true my wife is gonna make us move. /r/wholesomecomicsYour name isn't really wholesome but I have to agree.I would raise rent cost so I can filter out the lazy goodfornothin spiders while also generating a better revenue. This is complete nonsense.  More please. Then they're late with the rent/r/spiderbroOh my God that is so fucking cute.Thank mr spideyIsn't this just a cropped tumblr in action post?If only I could evict all of the spiders out of my house. They're scary :(The love for spidebros in this thread is warming me right up. In winter I take the spiders that I find in the house and move them to my container garden so they get light and food.Plus you get annoying pests out of your garden.

Now I feel bad\s\sBAD. On r/wholesomememesPoor spiders you can stay at mine for free :')My entire life makes cents now. And the bed bugs?I know this is way late but I had a dream recently of trying to remove a mouse recently from my home. He had a hella stylish haircut and I kept picking him up and taking him outside. He finally stood up on his hind legs and yelled at me in his tiny mouse voice ""FUCK YOU I OAY RENT HERE"" then skittered back into the house. I let him stay after that he deserved it.I'll never take another coin i find again.\s\sI dont want your fucking rent money spiders GET OUT!Omg this is finally relevant. So there was this family of tiny red spiders in my bathroom. They lived in the top corners of the shower and the corners of the wall above the sink. Only a handful of them. They were so small and they rarely ever moved that I didn't have the heart to kill them. So I let them stay. They lived in there for well over a year. Sometimes I'd worry they had starved but then I'd see them move an inch or two. They liked the dark I suppose.I love you guys :)lmfao do people actually believe this? spiders are not intelligent enough to understand the concept of rent and they dont stay in one permanent place so they dont have to pay ""rent"". i swear reddit pisses me off sometimes.Does that mean that when I pick up a spider by its legs and throw it out of the window I'm actually evicting it for not paying up on time? Most spiders are buds not bads.haha that's a lovely thoughtFound $61 under my bed after cleaning. Even for spiders rent is expensive here.

This is such a wonderful sub it even makes you feel wholesome for the spiders I'll make sure to thank the next black widow I see in my bathroom for being so responsible about her finances!Omg that adorable... So good that spiders are still being bros.I'm a terrible landlord.Fucking yesMy spiders pay their rent by catching mosquitos and stuffPersonally I'm quite fond of all my spider tenants and think that the ""flying insect removal service"" alone is quite sufficient for rent no need to pay anything more. I'm even willing to respect the integrity of the webs if they are in a place where they aren't getting in my way.spider bros > flying insectsI'm gonna give you a really considered pro-spider rationale.  Here goes.\s\s* Spiders move relatively slowly and can only come at you from the floor walls or ceiling.\s\s* Spiders don't though.  They mostly just leave you alone unless you rustle their jimmies somehow.\s\s* Spiders eat a lot of flying insects.\s\s* The flying insects sometimes sting or bite you and they come at you from any direction through the air.\s\sCONCLUSION: Bruh...spiders.This is me except with house centipedes instead of spiders. House centipedes are scary looking AF but they are total bros when it comes to keeping the house pest free. They tend to hide too so I rarely see them. They're like little unseen protectors from ants mosquitoes roaches bedbugs etc.I have an intense phobia of cockroaches (typing that word gave me full-body shivers) and a mild phobia of mosquitoes so spiders are my FAVE. I'm always grateful to see them around like little octopod Ghostbusters or something.I came here expecting to see lots of ""kill it anyway"" comments. Don't hate on our little spider bros and sis' they just eat yucky pesky bugs and keep your homes pest-free! They know they look a bit spoopy so they stay in the corner trying to keep out of sight.I wish they didn't freak me out so much but it's an automatic response. I know they didn't do anything wrong. If I could rewire my brain to be chill with them I would.>yucky pesky bugs.  \s????? Thsts literally what they are lol I always kill them \s\sWow thanks so much and thank you /u/skiskate for the gold!\sEveryone have a wholesome day/night :)\s\sAnd leave spiderbros be!:3Thanks spider bro. I know you work OT all for the family. I just wanna say Thanks for all the insects and bugs you clean up for me.\s\sThis month is on me. :)This is so awesome 😁Person: oh crap a spider...holding a coin? \s\sSpider: I'M NO FREELOADER. But they already pay rent by eating all the other bugs.Well they highly underestimated the cost of rent. I live alone now where there are never any bugs insects or spiders.  I never find any random money anymore.\s\s\sEvery other place that I lived before here I'd see various types all the time and I'd find random money all the time too!\s\s\sOP speaks the wholesome truth!\shttps://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/4v1wyg/what_if_the_coins_you_find_under_cushions_and_on/We don't all live in the ghettoI told them not to pay rent.

My wholesome-meter overloaded. That's not not the entire comic though...Makes sense.Maybe he's trying to pay you for all the snacks found under the cushions... Oh boy I think our resident spiders could be a little more generous with their contribution given MY contribution to ""all the snacks found under the cushions...""!Are you implying there's bugs under your couch cushions or that spiders eat crumbs?I used to have a black widow I let live in my apt. It stayed in its corner and never left its web. I had to evict it when my kids came to stay with me. I felt bad and missed it. I hope it understood why I had to put it outside. Now I feel bad :(This is the ultimate wholesome meme. My heart I feel bad now for putting them outside when I find one.Where I come from there is a myth that Mr. Nimatoshi leaves them behind as good luck charms to be spent on something needed but failing to thank Mr. Nimatoshi yields bad luck and finding fake Reddit comment stories that I just made up.That's really nice of them! My apartment spiders must know how expensive rent is; I find whole dollar bills bless their souls.That's cool spider friend can stay.\s\sI had one in my room that only stayed in the corner of my window and caught all the ants that came in through a tiny crack. Needless to say I didn't release it outside because it was doing me a favor.[deleted]Stick around here and you soon will! A shiver is just a friendly ghost saying hi.\s\sA random boner is a cute ghost flirting with your soul.\s\sA déjà vu is a ghost trying to give you premonition but they're not very good at it (they're trying though).\s\sUFO's are ghosts having wild sky orgies.\s\s\sSpiders sit in your shower to make sure  you don't drown. Little lifeguards :) dust bunnies or dust balls are actually bugs trying to make you clothes.I think that sounds like a really good pass time!I blame everything on fairies! :DIn the magical land of Foon it is well known that random coins and gems are deposited by from the bowels of helpful imps.

I really like spiders and I've never considered this. I love my arachnid friends.This comic made me finally click the subscribe button.My bathroom spider kills all the other bugs that come in he more than pulls his weightITT: Reddit finds they are the Nazis of spiders our hardworking 8 legged friends of the animal kingdom. For real though. All spiderbro has to do to live with me is pig out on insects and keep out of my 3 foot bubble. My house was infested with spiders over the summer and it's the first time I didn't have to raise a flyswatter. \s\sI ended up having some love bites so I had to shoo the ones out of my  bedroom. I only kill them if there is no other choice.Cute in the picture but then I'd probably freak out immediately at the thought of spiders crawling over me.

I'd love to see the artist's other work!Hi I think someone tagged it higher up :)I don't like being surprised by spiders but at the same time I don't bother to hunt them down either. Just yknow... spiderbro. When I'm in the shower please don't be two inches from my face. (I can barely see without my glasses so it was really scary)I agree! I don't go out of my way to kill or hunt them but I don't want them crawling on me either especially in the shower. Lol  Is there  anywhere i can go on reddit that won't give me nightamares?Beautiful. I feel bad now for putting them outside when I find one.Spider broI had some earwigs living in my mailbox and they gave me the creeps.  I was going through a tough time otherwise and I just ignored the problem.  I don't really like to kill bugs anyway.\s\sThen one day a spider moved into the mailbox and ate all the earwigs!

It's what some would consider overly PC but welcome most of it. Just in general gender stereotypes and just mild racist overtones are cringey.Yeah [this was a joke from MAD magazine when the original Star Wars came out](http://i.imgur.com/vTBYqBb.jpg)Don't forget Revenge of the Nerds which basically has glorified sexual assault and sexual harassment.I was reading old Thrasher skateboard magazines from the 90's the other day. The have an archive online. I read an early Rob Dyrdek interview when he probably in his teens. We are from the same area and wanted to see if he would talk about Ohio. It was just filled with homophobic language. His advice to kids was ""Don't take it in the ass"". Made me think were we all this bad about this back then?\s [That verse from _Money for Nothing_ that you ~~never~~ only sometimes hear on the radio anymore...](https://youtu.be/ZC1Pdsppch4?t=170)[deleted]I don't remember what show I was watching but it was a couple of cops and one said something like ""Nice did you pick that up in ballet class?"" \s\sAdmittedly intoxicated I yelled ""HOW IS THAT AN INSULT??!"" to no one in particular.

I found them annoying or low brow humor stupid. I find comedy to be easy funnier these days with movies like Disaster Artist The House and Keanu I laughed my ass off watching those movies when I expected most of them to be crap. The humor is just more objectively funny not at anyone's expense but because it's a genuinely hilarious situation.Admittedly this is a stretch for the sake of argument but in the context of the original Spider-Man movie would it be a fair interpretation that Spider-Man is only asking this question because he knows Bonesaw is an insecure homophobe and wants to rile him up and/or make fun of him for it?\s\sJust trying to bend over backwards to make sure Spider-Man can stay friendly to everyone.\sAnd here we are with Big Bang theory ""LMAO THEY DID SOMETHING NOT CONSIDERED TRADITIONALLY MASCULINE AND MAKE FUN OF EACHOTHER FOR IT!""Blazing Saddles will always be a classic and theres no way that movie would be greenlit todayDon't have to go that far a lot of the shit from early '00s is plenty homophobic too.

He **got** to hear that.Love is not fornication. All sexual immorality is an abomination in Christ's eyes. Even sensuality. #DIG IT[removed]Dig it!#metooBONESAWDid Randy Savage just make Spiderman a bad guy? These are some unwholesome comments :(That's because the meme isn't wholesome it's trite. LmaoI think you mean the PHANTOM SPIDERr/bonehurtingjuice/r/unexpectedBONESAW IS READEEEY... to rise up against harmful stereotypes and rally against hate in our modern community.Social Bone Justice Saw Warrior. Read that in Macho Mans voice in my head. Understandable have a good day sir.That's gay.[removed]I legit thought i was in bonehurtingjuiceIt isn'tSavage response.Funny story about this scene:\s\sI must have been about 6 years old when I first saw this film and remember watching and hear Spidey say ""Husband"".\s\sNow being such a young lad I wasn't privy to the knowledge of different sexualities and was none the wiser to anything other than a straight relationship so naturally I innocently enquired ""Mum... He said husband... But he's a boy. Shouldn't he say wife?"" \s\sNow just to clarify my mother is extremely open to the idea of sexual equality but she had just been unwillingly put in the position of having to explain homosexuality to her six year old as the result of a simple adult joke that essentially ridiculed the idea of being gay. It was *not* an easy position to be in. So what did she choose to say?\s\s""Well Mr_Chiddy... Uh... When this film was made it used to be the case that the woman was called the husband and the man was called the wife... They decided to change it around just after it came out and that's the way it is today!""\s\sI fully believed this to be true until I was about 15 years old despite only hearing this fact from her...\s\s**TL:DR;**I was a dense kid.She could have just said that he's implying the guy was a girl.Nah you weren't a dense kid. You just had faith in the things that a trusting parental figure told you. This is the same person who maybe taught you how to tie your shoes and your ABCs and all other important things about the world. They generally had your best interests in mind in everything they said or did for you. So you had no reason not to believe them.\s\sBasically what I'm trying to say is that you weren't a dumb kid and your mother was a dirty filthy liar.\sIs your mom Calvin's dad? You got his name wrong! He's the Human Spider!Did anyone else read it in Randy Savage's voice or was it just meI’m glad that’s not how the actual movie went. Bonesaw was readyRest in peace Macho Man Randy Savage :(Wait that's **Randy Savage**? I had no idea!*BonesawThat was also his last filmed elbow drop from the top ropeThat's Bonesaw not Randy SavageWait so Randy's the ""Macho Man"" the Village People were singing about? It all makes sense now!If anyone was ever on the right side of history. May we all learn from his example.Can't rest when [there's work to do.](http://i.imgur.com/aPuz5.jpg)I had to look it up and his death wasn't even that recent 2011. I didn't he'd only become a successful meme posthumously.All the skyrim mods do him justice Well he did save us from the rapture so...Just a reminder whenever Randy Savage comes up he stopped the rapture for humanity’s sake.\s\sGod bless.Oh this is awful Look who's taking! He needs to chill. Not everyone has to like you. Life goes on.Damn don’t try it Spidey Randy has the moral high ground ***BONESAW IS READY***BOOOOONE SAWWWW IS READDYYYYY\sI quote parts of this scene SO much lmaoOh did they change it back to a radioactive spider? I remember it became a genetically engineered spider...In Ultimate Spider-Man it was a genetically engineered spider but as far as I know it was never changed from a radioactive spider in the main universe. It’s the human spider... he got my name wrong.Lol this actually pretty dankThe “woke Charlotte” phenomenon is spreading!! Love this!Am I the only one that read that in the Macho Man voice?*bonesaw\s\sMacho man was a different guyThis is horrible you should feel horrible. Let's all feel horrible together.

Did anyone else read it in Bone Saw's voice?Is what would of been said if they filmed this in 2017. Whats this from?[removed][removed]I read all of that in Macho Man's voice. It was fantastic. Ohhh yyyyyeah!I get the message this is trying to portray but does nobody else think this is kinda like cringe worthy? https://www.reddit.com/r/raimimemes/[removed][removed]why does he look like axe from dota 2 lolYOU’RE GOIN’ NOWHERE !!it messes me up how he raises his pinky ring and middle fingers when he says three minutesBONESAAAWWWW IS REEEAAADDDYYYYIVE GOT YOU FOR THREE MINUTES! THREE MINUTES OF PLAYTIIIME!I say this to my baby almost everydayIs this even a joke? It's just needlessly preaching like nobody can make a little joke without somebody going into some long rant to prove their righteousness.Tbh it is a really bad joke.A+I GOT YOU FOR 3 MINUTES!!! I assume we all read that entire thing in macho man randy savage's voiceBONESAW IS READY for equality.I watched this recently and I was pretty startled by it. This definitely would have caused an uproar today. \s\sI wonder what things we're doing now that will be controversial I'm the future.I don't think that was said in the movie at all. If I'm correct he didn't say anything at all.It's astounding the stuff you giggle at as a kid and then as an adult you finally ask yourself ""exactly why is this a punchline?""Bone saw had a cult following at my high school. Specifically my class. For some reason we were stuck inside and we had 30 minutes to kill so the school put on Spider-Man which I guess this scene happens in that span. Well I guess we were just bored and we’re an all boys school but man we really fucking loved Macho Man’s role in that movie. Every pep rally we’d do the bonesaw thing. It was also my intramural nickname in college. Good times. RIPr/raimimemesHey he stole that guys pizza!Wait I already thought I was in r/raimimemes frickin mobileOh but holy shit. Subscribed People need to know this exists Holy shit! \s\sFucking clicked that subscribe button faster than Spiderman's pizza deliveries Of course that's a thing. Can this be the next r/prequelmemes But what does raimi stand for?BONE SAW!Fucking greatAll I can see is how shitty the special effects were in that movie.Man imagine how many people would get offended nowadays if this movie came out now? I remember thinking that was funny as fuck when I was younger watching it. Now people would take to Twitter complaining about how homophobic this new Spiderman movie is with just one jokeIt's a lowbrow joke the movie can certainly do without. What's redeeming about it?Seems better suited to /r/bonehurtingjuice>history\s\s>wrong side\s\sWhat was meant by this?""The wrong side of history"" is a phrase used to say that the view a person is defending is against social progress and will be remembered in history as wrong harmful or even evil. The people that defended eugenics into the 20th century would be a good example of people who ended up on the wrong side of history.It roughly translates to ""I'm better than you""For all those interested the late great Macho Man released a rap album back in 04 entitled “Be a man”. It is horribly wonderful. I always thought of this more as the writers poking fun at how homophobic people like Macho Man's character tend to be and Peter is just saying what he thinks would be most offensive to him.You mean spidermans attacking his body and his ego?Fun Fact: the effect in the last frame where Peter Parker/Spider-Man seems ""surprised"" or ""shocked"" while not changing his expression from the first frame is called the [Kuleshov Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect). Named after Lev Kuleshov he edited a short film that just had a actor staring blankly into the screen interspersed with shots of a dying child a bowl of soup and a beautiful woman. ([Link to the video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=grCPqoFwp5k) Special thanks to u/lefukos for [finding the video](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/7la90c/cute_outfit/drlj8kx)) People would rant and rave about the actor's ability until they realized ""Oh shoot it was the same shot repeated like 4 times.""\s\sKind of a weird time to see it in a meme on Reddit but that only makes it cooler.\s\sEdit: Guys you're awesome. This became my top comment in only a few hours. The best part is that you guys *actually seem to care!* And about film history too!That is a fun fact thank you for sharing! I'm probably going to start noticing this effect more.If anyone is wondering here is the [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=grCPqoFwp5k) If I don’t see it does that make me a psychopath?To me they all seem identical. Don't know why some people can see it differently but I can't.Is it one of things that if you know about it doesn't work? Because I just saw the same image. Or maybe because I don't want understand what's being said? Interesting effect!Found the film school student.This is more upvote worthy than the original post! This is fascinating. Subscribe! sooooooo good omgBeat the devil out a little bitI don't get it\sHe was a shitty person to real people so he could fight a fake video game boss for eternity. It's dumb as fuck for this sub to post. Why'd he beat tf out of that guy?Really good! Would have packed more of a punch if the panels of him in the hospital weren't there but I liked it!:')I love it! Great job!!The hero we need!I actually want to see a sequel of this comic about this firefighter.  I want origins.This is exactly how I feel. I was with a girl for 35 years and when it came to the point where being together would not be the best possible thing for us i broke it off. Not because I didn't love her but because I wanted to love her forever and I knew that we would have to work and invest on ourselves to make this happen. 3 years after i reached out and spoke to her gave her a letter. She loves me back she read a poem that she wrote about us. I am waiting to hear back from her. CAN I ASK FOR EVERYBODY'S SUPPORT I AM TERRIFIED.She loves you and you love her. That's what's most important.\s\sRemember that the you and her of today are different people than the you and her of three years ago. That's not a bad thing I'm just bringing it up because things will go better if you're aware of that and accept it. \s\sThe two of you have three years of new things to discover about each other.Good work my guy (or gal). You've got this.That's dedication folks.Like they have fire hydrants in hell.Ohhhhhh. Duh. Thanks.Maybe I'm wrong on how damnation works but shouldn't his good intentions override his bad actions and send him to Heaven anyway?\s\sEither way I love this. \s\s**Edit:** TIL theology""The road to hell is paved with good intentions""Assuming this is a Christian morality question (most modern assumptions about hell are Judeo-Christian) then sort of. Christian morality teaches that the intent behind your actions plays a role in their justification but good intent can never redeem an inherently awful action. Depends on who you ask fam.Maybe going to Hell to fight a never ending fire is his version of Heaven.You still have to cleanse yourself of the bad you did; confessions prayer for forgiveness baptism ect. Even when you're doing right by people the wrong you've done will still weigh on your soul. Owning up to what you've done(confession) and asking for forgiveness will not only bring you peace but the people around you. If you have any more questions please ask.Even if we restrict ourselves to Christian theology it depends on who you ask (or what you like most). \s\sThe spectrum goes from simply believing in Jesus and somehow accepting him as your savior over receiving sacraments from specific people to just being a good person. \s\sEvery interpretation is backed up by a passage in the Bible (or in some cases additional ""prophicies"") while seemingly contradictory passages are downplayed to be of symbolic character. No. Contrary to what most people think about Christianity good deeds don't save you.\s\sEphesians 2:8-9 ""For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is a gift of God not a result of works so that no one may boast.""If you are going to be bible canon the comic wouldn't make sense. \s\sThe devil isn't ruler in hell after the judgement day he is going to be tormented in the lake of fire like every sinner. \s\sAFAIK he also haven't access to hell before judgement dayTook me a day to get this oneDoomguy as a firefighterThis actually gave me a big emotional response. Eyes pickled a little bit. [deleted]😿Your eyes pickled? I've never heard that phrase beforeIt's funny as hell not sad. Wonder how many people that motherfucker punched in the face.Why did he punch that dude though?To go to hell. Ie being a bad person.Oh please... the real way to do it is to teleport into hell from one of the moons of Mars and destroy demons with a shotgun.This is has to be one of the coolest wholesome comics i have seen lately! Awesome stuff op :')It's missing the part where fire killed his parents thus the motivation.It's not OP's it's a comic at www.buttersafe.com\s\sI think their stuff at best is *so* good. Really thrilled to see this one take off so much the creators totally deserve it.\s\sEdit: [Here's](http://buttersafe.com/2010/09/16/this-sword-is-so-sharp/) another fave that actually helped me through a breakup and [Veiny Dog](http://buttersafe.com/2010/06/24/veiny-dog-days/).It's meta-wholesome?\s\sIt transcends wholesomeness by turning it in on itself thereby taking it to the next level?\s\sI'm trying to figure it out.I subscribed to r/wholesomememes 5 months ago and have never regretted the decision. I love you guys. It was even more wholesome as I only saw the last part as I scrolled down.\s\sI was like ""damn"". Maybe he only had good intent his entire life so the final picture is his heaven. Yeah I was extremely confused by this at first..I understand now that him punching the other guy is why he ends up in hell to fight the greatest fires of all!\s\sHowever at first glance it looks like the guy who got punched wakes up 50 years later to come back as a demon and hunt down the firefighter who punched him.Gave me goosebumps.""Why do we have fire hoses and water lines installed here?""\s\s- the devil probablyOH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODIs this a rip off of the comic where Hitler kills himself to go fight Jesus?\sEdit: found it \shttp://explosm.net/comics/4045Eli5?Man is such a dedicated firefighter that he goes through life doing terrible things just so he can get sent to Hell and put out all the fires there.This made me Aaawwweeee 😢😭""You'll be damning yourself to the fiery pits of hell itself!""\s\s*puts on sunglasses and firefighter helmet*\s\s""That the plan kiddo...""Too tough for hell.\s\s\sLike the space marine from DoomHeh nothing personnel SatanI missed the point until I read your comment. Awww. Thank you.""You can't tell me to go to hell.

This is a video-game that I want to play.I don't get it at all....do bad stuff -> go to hell -> put out hellfire -> ??? -> profit!I don't get it I feel stupidSay hi to Doom's Space Marine! Link to author website. http://buttersafe.comI was genuinely moved :')Oh the guy in hospital is the firefighter!\s\sFor some reason I thought the guy he punched was put in a coma for 50 years and was really confusedOh. The guy who died is the firefighter not the guy in the blue shirt who gets punched. He dies wearing a blue shirt so I was confused. My first interpretation was that blue shirt guy is upset about getting assaulted and dies and comes back to life as a fire monster to beat the firefighter. Yeah I thought that same thing too. Then I saw the scar thingys.It seems like this sub has completely forgotten what ""wholesome"" means. Being a shitty person to fight a fairy tale doesn't qualify. He didn't have to beat people up to go to hell. All you have to do is not accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and you'll go to HellIt's like he's trying to unlock Veteran mode and he just got the elusive Easter egg all in one.I would heckin' love to see this as a video.This man is in fact in his own version of heaven. He clearly loves serving people and what he wants most of all before he rests is to perform the ultimate rescue. Hence when he died he arrived in a version of hell with the hose to put it out. If he were really in hell he wouldn't have the hose!This would actually be a super cool idea for a full length graphic novel.Read this twice cause it made me :) so much the first time.r/CometKing?This is an awesome plan. u/firefighterguy12 is that you?I don't get it. 🤔🤔 Can someone explain? 🤗🤗\s\sE: nevermind.Yo but like what if things really worked this way and we could really do this.

A comic about Jesus! [Maybe he is Doomguy brother?](https://i.imgur.com/9rbAlAp.jpg)That's kind of epic. Like in the original sense of the word.I don't get it.\sI didn't either. He acted like a horrible human being so he'd go to hell and fight the biggest fire. Its weird. He loves fighting fires and helping people so much that he acted like a jerk so he would get sent to hell so he fight the devil and put out the fires down there. Well this would be kinda sad if there's no afterlife because then he would've just been a dickHe is like a firefighter Batman.I'd like to know what that fire hose did to also get sent to hell.\s\sNevermind I actually don't want to know.""I'm an asshole my whole life"". How wholesome!I had to read that three times AND read the title of the post again before I got it. Holy I'm having an off dayI love this!

Thank you!   I thought the hospital was the original guy in the blue shirt. \s(But why did firefighter punch the blue shirt originally???)Thanks for clearing that up! I thought the guy in the hospital was the guy who got punched and his plan all along was to start fires to eventually go to Hell and become Satan and I thought ""how is this wholesome at ALL?"" Thank you for this!  I was totally confused about who was in the hospital bedI definitely did.  I thought there was a whole story that I missed about how the guy knew he was going to hell and the punch from the firefighter inspired him to kill Satan when he gets there.Wow thanks...now I get itOh I get it now.  I thought the guy he punched was Satan.... It makes so much more sense now!You're my heroOr give him a firefighter mustacheHe should have just been wearing his fireman hat while in the hospital bed because why notYeah I first thought he was punched into a coma.Ooooooooooooohhhhhh.\s\s\sOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH.\s\s#OOOOOHHHHHHHe should just be in the hospital bed in his Firefighting uniform.Oh wow. Okay. I still don't get it but this helps. Oh thats why i didnt understand it[deleted]No the firefighter wants to go to hell for his behaviourIn the first age in the first battle when the shadows first lengthened one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension he chose the path of perpetual torment...Wait how'd he get a fire hose in hell?I like this. Well done Didn't click on the imgur and only looked at the thumbnail. I was so confuseda fellow buttersafe reader!And then he and the devil have a conversation and the devil realizes that what he's been doing is wrong Took me a second to get lol nice one This is similar to why I'm a self destructive piece of shit. While all the good and pure people will be saved in the rapture I'll have the privalege of fighting alongside Jesus during the tribulations. Where did you get this idea from?Somone PLEASE make a writing prompt about this.I don't quite see how this comic is wholesome...?Did not see that coming genuinely amused. Good comic. Surprised so many redditors are having such a hard time understanding itThis makes no sense.  His plan was to be polite and grateful knowing this would cause the fireman to punch him?The firefighter was being mean so he would be sent to hell so he could fight the fires of hell.Take that SatanYesIs this the new dark souls dlc? This should seriously be made into a movie. It took me a while to realize it was the dying firefighter going to hell. Thought it was the guy he punched out waking from a coma 50 years later (all because the artist used blue shirts for both characters).Now that's a long con if I ever saw one...Queue the Dark Souls Boss fight musicButtersafe can basically be summed up as somewhat dark wholesome memes.You.... You will be worse.... Surround and drown until it is done.\s\s*Dun nuh nuh nuh nuuhh nuhh nuhh nuhh*Wait....what's so wholesome about this? I don't get it? Someone explain!!!![deleted]He did bad things such as punching the guy in the face so that he would be sent to hell and fight Satan. Thank you for asking and continuing to ask about the first panels because I didn't get it either.He sacrificed his own dignity and happiness to face down Satan and extinguish the fires of Hell. That's pretty awesomeCan someone make a game based on being a Veteran fire fighter in hell?Took me some thinking to see this one through. Nice!How does he get a functioning hose into hell?This is...oddly deeply creative in some really tickling way. Great job. Your mind seems like a fun place to live.I don't know man. I think this crosses that rare bridge from wholesome to straight up metal. Especially when heck gets involved. \s\sI love this!This was my first reddit post/meme I saw since joining Reddit and I will forever remember it. \s(If you think I'm trolling compare my days to this meme's daysI don't get why he punched him?He acts like a horrible person so he gets sent to hell and then has to put out the fireWas trying to go to hell so he could put out the hellfireHe wanted to go to hell when he died so he could fight the devil since Hell is filled with fire.\s\sThat is why he was a ""terrible human being"".Oh wow a LOT of people in this thread did not get the joke lol/u/waterguy12 doing his duty for the greater good[deleted]I don't get why he punched the dudeTo get sent to hell so he could put out hells fireHe was trying to be an awful person so he would go to hell when he died.Buttersafe is my favorite webcomic. I met the artists at a comic convention and asked them what the title meant and they said it was inspired by an old patent for a safe to store your butter. I'm really high right now does it make sense? Am I missing something here? The man does bad stuff on Earth thus he is sent to hell and his intentions all along we're to fight Satan he basically did all the bad stuff for the greater good.Don't know why you got downvoted for not understanding he was doing bad deeds to go to hell so he could defeat Satan and put out the hellfire.Chills dude. I want to see something like this in a shortfilm.So the guy who got punched turns in to the devil and comes back for the firefighter who is somehow still alive 50 years later and still firefighting? I mean okay seems kind of odd but whatever why did he punch the guy?To ensure he goes to hellI was really rooting for the firefighter in that last cell. \s\sIt leads me to another question what happens when hell is put out? Can we agree that hell really doesn't serve a function in today's society? I mean even if it *was* real which most of us believe it isn't the mere fact that few people believe in it kind of removes it's function as a disincentive for being bad.\s\sAnd for the people who *do* believe in it I feel that most of them are *good* because they want to go to heaven.\s\sWhat do the rest of ya'll think?\s\s[Reminds me of this one](https://m.imgur.com/r/comics/L16d2qG) Oh shit CBS should pick this up and make a show out of it.Respectfully this probably belongs in /r/dankchristianmemes. As a person who finds the concept of hell very silly this just comes across as an awkward fantasy. Do you need a stool to get over yourself?u/fireguy12The people in this comic look exactly like the people in the ""Eternal Torment"" comic from earlier.  Is it the same comic or something else?  Sort of illustrates my comment on the other comic that is getting downvoted.Aside from the ending this comic doesn't make any sense. Can someone explain?He does bad things on purpose to end up in hell after he dies so he can extinguish the fires over there. :)someone should have told that guy hell isnt a real thingI think my humor button is broken. That's the sort of twist Shyamalan dreams about at night.

Nice attention to detail! Took me a while to get it and I can see the wholesomeness but isn't he also making hell a better place for those who have been sent there?

In the back of my mind I stood and cheered for the firefighter (because I almost did IRL).Hey that was actually clever.I don't get itI only scrolled as far as the first three frames at first and thought that was it. Was wondering why it was wholesome before moving on and realising.Geeeez this took way longer for me to get that I care to admit. This is so not wholesome. He punched an innocent person AgreeCue Pacific Rim theme song/u/waterguy12So does he save Satan from the fire though?I'm on Mobile didn't realize there was an extra panel at the bottom I was quite confused.\s\sThought it was about a good firefighter that was a dick and then died.I dont get it\sHe punches the dude and does other terrible things so that he will get sent to Hell and can put out the fires there.Diablo 4 looks crazy So what does Jeff Payne intend to do arrest Satan? I appreciate how the ECG reading shows a proper PQRST wave :3I came here to say the same thing though his qrs does seem a bit wide if I'm being nitpicky... which I'm not!

First time visiting in a long time and I already love this sub.This reminds me of when I was in the court.RadAlso Berlin Fun fact in the song there is no mention of Humpty being an egg.This man has 100% skipped leg day.He’s never skipped egg day thoHe doesn’t have to live up to anyone’s standards but his own. Or as the French call it... L’egg dayWhat are you taking about? Dude's yolkedAnd arm dayIt is widely rumored that he spent it sitting on walls.Yet he doesn't worry because his family loves him regardless Leg day is every day Skipped arms day too. He only works on his belly... like most of us.If this will be 100% then there will be no legs at all I think :(He is an egg !Guess he was tired of wasting time on that wall of his.I’ve been playing dark souls 3 for the past few hours and am stuck on Dragonslayer boss.

You can follow me at: [https://www.facebook.com/WholesomeNsuchArt/](https://www.facebook.com/WholesomeNsuchArt/)\s\sI just made the page today so nothing is on it yet... But there will be!This.

Happy cake day :)ty now i'm jealous of a fictitious eggAWWWThis... this made every cell in my body feel pure joy. Is this loss?Am I the only one that tried to connect all the letters with yellow inside and thought it would have some sort of special meaning? Sadly enough I cannot figure out what pDpadageaa means  :(""But how can a person be an egg?"" I saw OP's username and checked their post history. Was not dissapointed. Have a nice day OP. The whole story is adorableAll the king's horses and all the king's men  \swere jealous of how great his Autumn had been.Haha this is so cute !love it but why are the counters filled in on the letters?: )My aspirations!!Autumn is such a lovely word I don't get it America I mean sure the leaves fall but that is very autumnal. \s:)You dont know what youve doneHahaCuteI pitty him it looks niceLooks so cozy. Good on him! Seems to have gone unnoticed this pun.He’s stabbing a pumpkin though!I've had a really rough week but tis subreddit made my whole night thank you all so much I actually think I'm gonna cry sad-happy confusing tearsLove this!!!

This took me way too long to get. 84000th upvote exactly He's a good egg !Adorable. Very wholesome indeed.Very yolksome. 🐣Yes I can agree this is a very wholesome meme too be honest where has this sub-reddit been this whole time But now its time for me to make an omelette...No it's not. It's sick and disturbing. First of all what kind of egg has a mouth eyes legs arms and hands? Secondly how does it have the ability to read? Also why is he that big compared to a cat? Why kind of dinosaur layed that egg?\s\sIts sick I tell you. Sick.Happy cake day!!!I completely agree! That took a great turnHumpty was never described as an eggYes he was.\s\sGee this is fun.Humpty Dumpty had a great autumn doesn't quite have the same ring to it does it?Good for him very glad he's happy.Saw this as the first post. Immediately subscribed. Made my dayI needed this. It's adorable Whys he always an egg??The poem is a riddle. The solution is that he is an egg.Fall is the best time of year. \s\sKids are off the streets after a summer of stupidity the best tv shows return the weather gets just cold enough where its still comfortable with a sweatshirt and you can always justify a hot drink football is back campus full of life and of course the leaves start turning and setting everything ""on fire"" and it looks amazing. Plus the monthly succession of real holidays from Halloween to Thanksgiving to Christmas begins.Perfectly summed up. Great work. [deleted]Oof I only had like 50 minutes of fall hereYou forgot the most important part.  Red Dead Redemption 2!Makes me wish we had fall in Australia. Only really get summer and winter. Though there is a small part of the year that resembles Spring.This was so well put that I was afraid we’d be going back to nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer’s table. ❤️☕[deleted]In the UK it's just rain wind cold rain Halloween chocolate in Tesco rain school/uni work starting rain and did I mention rain?Plus new phone releases!That really depends on where you are. Here in the Netherlands the weather just turns grey and miserable and you have to wear a coat all the time. And brown and red leaves aren't so pretty if they've been blown off the branches and turn into soggy smelly muck in the streets. And Halloween and Thanksgiving aren't a thing here so the fun doesn't start until December. And the TV show thing used to be true but now we have Netflix so who cares? ;)You need many upvotes.What area do you live in where the weather is like that? Where I am summer is just a slightly more tame summer same with spring.He's a cosy egg[deleted]It doesn't. He just evolved to be depicted as an egg over time and the egg visual is the one that stuck around the best.Why does he have a pet rock thoughScissors! ✌ I loseI love this so much.Does he always wear jeans?  Doesn't seem comfortable but that is a dope fall jacket.Just to say the nursery rhyme never mentions Humpty's gender.\s\s(older versions of the rhyme do and Humpty is male in [Alice Through the Looking Glass](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12/12-h/12-h.htm#link2HCH0006))""Winter was meh Spring was nice Summer was OK but I had a great Fall.""\s\sEdit: Sorry. Got to the party late.Oh no!!! Is fall already over?!?\s\sDid I miss it!! Please no!Im glad that he enjoyed himself. Humpty is a real hard working dude. :)Just remember; at no point in the poem/song did they say he was an egg Now all childhood dreams have been faded away.Does nobody realize that the letters are filled in BECAUSE THE YOLK HASNT SPILLED OUT??Finally an actual wholesome *meme*u/Rescued_Doggos this isnt a photo/video of a rescued doggo is everything ok?Has* \s\sIt just beganTop notchI really needed this. My emotionally abusive ex is emailing me every 20 minutes and I was scrolling through Reddit to try to fill my brain with something else. Saw this and smiled. Thank you.Woah hope things get better.Yikes good luck! Woo boy. I know that feel.\s\sI'm going thru some shit too.Oh gosh! Hang in there I hope he’s stopped by now :c Am I the only one who noticed that the letters aren’t filled in?No.Would love to see humpty have a great winter spring and summer too.Ngl. This made me smile.Took little more than two minutes :) \s\s&#x200B;\s\sHad a great fall and I was looking for wall and broken head.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s&#x200B;he ain't fall onceThen he died in the Winterwhoever said humpty dumpty was an egg????How is this trending for meAnd then I stomped on him hard.Awww his little hat I love the cozy kitty Humpty’s Fall was great. That pumpkin not so muchIs humpty dumpty an egg? If so an easter egg or real egg?im sensing a real frank reynolds vibe going on with those skinny jeansIs this......Nowhere in the nursery rhyme does it allude to Humpty being an egg. Out there living his best life finally Love this!That's me being 60 days sober lolAt least he’s having a good dayYa’ll pick apples in fall?Yeah you don't?That 's so wholesome🙂Humpy is not in Canada that’s for sure!Truly amazingOhhhhhh I get itSo glad to see he got off crack - ing This picture gives me a sense of serenity and calmness.\sI wish I could have a fall like that! Here where I live it's either summer or winter ahahI was going to post thisssss :( I’ve never felt happier for an eggBut jumpy dumpty got no candy at all[deleted]the rhyme was thought to be a riddle and the ""egg"" was most commonly thought to be the answer.\s\seither that or Humpty Dumpty was King George III. (lost his mind cracked went looney etc.)Ehh its an old yolk taleI mean what else breaks into pieces when it falls from a wall? I guess humpty can be a vase or your iPhone if you really want.I guess its just tradition at this point.The poem is a riddle. That he is an egg is the solution.It's about a war cannon that fell and broke I believe. Not a riddle about an egg. Do you think he would invite all the king’s men to his Halloween party?Sausage and eggs I dig it!The scariest thing about humpty dumpty is that no one ever said he was an egg This is the third time in a week I saved something to my phone came to r/wholesomememes to share it and immediately saw it at the top of the feed.\s\sAnd that makes it all the more wholesome to me! :)Yes trueI'm thinking if eggs are walking around on the street why wouldn't the pumpkin be alive aswell?. Well it was alive. And it's child. My best friend made this! I was the first person to share it! It makes me so happy that this is the first thing I saw on reddit! What’s their reddit? I bet people would love it if they posted more of their work!      \sedit - Oops I’m dumb and didn’t realize you already commented their account aaaaau/mustachesrtrustwrthy I can't find you comment claiming itBest thing I’ve seen today. It made me so happy for Humpty Dumpty. I can almost feel his joy. Nowhere is he ever described as being an egg or egg shaped!!! 👍🇺🇸👌And yet he’s constantly depicted as one so why be pressed about some cute art about an egg boy!!! 👍👌Ohhhhhh I get itOhh now I get itThe idea and thought of doing all those things seems super duper cozy but i know i'll be bored out of my mind picking apples or reading a book. Why the fuck is that?i greatest fall for dumpty he needs itHumpty Dumpty got himself together againNot in Alberta tho haha 🙃So cute lifestyle i wish if i could be oneI wish I could relateAll the king's horses and all the king's men had a Halloween party and plan to have one again.u/jeet474XDIs this loss?I wish I lived somewhere where I could experience fall :/LOL that’s nice dudeI feel really good now!Ohhhh...\sI finally get it after 2 minutes /r/egg_irlAwe cute.

\sThe Sikh temple in my community also serves the Hindu community because their population is a lot lower and they can’t afford a temple.  Pretty cool stuff.

Good stuff. 1000 commentThat hug gives me life. Look how tightly they’re squeezing one another!Beautiful :) Genuinely curious is there something about the architecture that makes a mosque a mosque specifically? Like can't any building be a mosque as long as Muslims worship inside it?Yes. Any building can be a mosque. I'm guessing there wasn't a mosque around here for Muslims to pray in so he made this Old but goldYeah I think we're good on that whole humanity and Muslim thing lol.But isn't it said that god is eveywhere and you can pray even in your home?

Yes but some religions believe you need to go somewhere specific to do so. Yup but it’s encouraged to pray in a mosque and with others since it yields more reward.\s\sSource: Am Muslim.Imagine a world where everyone demonstrated this level of caring and selflessness[removed][removed][removed]Cant you pray anywhere?Who is America?There actually is good in this world! Just warms my heartCan we talk about how awesome sikh people are? Great bunch of peopleMad respect for my Sikh brosCan’t muslims technically pray anywhere? Goin to the mosque 2 mandeep Sikh meme bro!I pray that you do not make that joke againthanksThis hug is a good hug look at the fervent squeezeHas he gotten better?SIKHS ARE FUCKING AWESOMEI misread pray as party at first lmaoI acctually started tearing up. This is so sweet This is the most beautiful thing in the world. I think it cured my bad night <3 It’s cute though r/humansbeingbrosA Sikh man indeed!I'm a Christian but I don't remember ever reading anything bad about Sikhs as a group.  In fact I generally see really positive things about em.\s\sAlso gotta respect a faith that commands the adherents to protect those who cannot protect themselves.\s\s<3I mean Christianity says to do that but a lot of people kinda choose to ignore those sections. In the mid 1980s there was a relatively strong Sikh nationalist movement in India that includes terrorist elements. Said terrorists blew up [Air India Flight 182](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182) en route from Vancouver and Montréal to London and New Delhi killing 329 people. A second bomb was supposed to take down another flight going westbound but the bag [exploded at Narita Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Narita_International_Airport_bombing) before it could be loaded onto the plane.\s\sI mention this attack not to demonize Sikhs in any way only to point out that all religious groups — all large groups of humanity really — have their positive and negative influences on the world. Sikh nationalism has pretty much died out in the 33 years since the attack. And I hope more people will take inspiration for their actions from photos like this post’s and not from violence and hatred.Well all religions and non-religious groups have done terrible things. Sikhs included.\s\sIts best not to ponder about the evils of man. Can we not generalize about religion at all here? Because it's not gonna end well even if it's well intentioned. People do god-awful things in the name of religion just as they do beautiful compassionate things. It's just not reliable or fair or just to say oh he's a Sikh so he's a nice guy.\s\sHe's a nice guy and he happens to be Sikh.> I'm a Christian but I don't remember ever reading anything bad about Sikhs as a group\s\sMull that statement over for a second. There were Sikh's who blew up a plane in a terrorism attack in Canada but that doesn't say anything about Sikh's as a group.\s\sSame with every religion. \s\s(And if I can opine a bit Christianity is just bad and incoherent philosophy but that doesn't say anything about Christians as a group.)Thanks a huge part of out religion is ""we just don't like bullies""Sikhs have been tame in comparison to a lot of other religions.  They are almost always chill.  They had a violent nationalists movement for a bit but that seems to have been forgotten by the community itself. So hecking cute. Brightened my day We can all Sikh to learn something about Humanity from Sihks.I smell an infidel. This dude's sikhThere's this one sikh guy in my school had classes with him last year didn't know much English but everyone knew he was pretty cool What's the problem to pray at your home???yall fellas just ever build your hommie a building???I would  but all my friends disowned me for being atheist jokes on them ;-; I build cardboard castles for my cats all the time.What are the rules? I’m down. I build a pillow fort for my best mate when I was 9.\s\sWe played taken 3 for 5 hoursSomeday Hope the sikh man is doing well 😊I think that’s a crazy amazing thing for a human being to do. To be so thoughtful and caring about another person is truly beautiful. I just wonder.. if you 100% believe in your religion would you be 100% supportive of your friend being in another? \s\sI have a religion and I don’t talk about religion with my friends at all. Like ever. I support their right to choose to do whatever they want with their life. ..but I still do want them not end up in hell you know?JustSNThingsNice green screen yoThis makes me so happy. ❤️What a mensch.Victory RoyaleThat's a cool looking little mosque. I'd pray in that mosque and I'm an atheistI've always appreciated the architecture of places of worship aside from the majority of Christian churches as they mostly look like they come off an assembly line. What can I say when your religion espouses the pursuit of all knowledge art geometry and architecture make something beautiful. [removed]I'm curious does it ever go the other way?\s\sI see stories occasionally about  Sikh people building things for others..  but do muslim people build for other religions?\s\s\sI really don't know anything about either of them but am curious.[deleted]I have seen this before but wow. Imagine your friend come up to you and say: hey so i heard x means a lot you so i built you a building broDude this guy is sihk. He was able to muslim up a mosque. \s\sI ran out of puns. SorryNow waiting for a Moslem to build a Sikh temple. LOL.God bless ! ❤️Sick!Hope that Sikh man gets to feeling better soon. Seems like a nice guy. What a nice guy. I hope he gets healthier soonwhat makes you think he’s unhealthy?Nice.SikhSikh and ye shall find.That looks like a good hugThe best part about this is you know there are so people just learning that there's a difference between the twoAHAHAHAHA THATS SO TRUE!!! I’m a Muslim and I’ve gotten “wait I thought you were like Indian” before... they meant Hindu... and I’m Bangladeshi XDNah man the best part is that they are so kind :iBack in 2011 in the UK there were riots up and down the country with people looting and vandalising everything. It was mainly due to escalation of events following a fatal police shooting of a young man however it was used by many as an excuse to just go mad unfortunately. \s\sIt just so happened to have taken place during the month of Ramadan where Muslims attend a night prayer at mosques during this time Sikhs stood outside the mosques as deterrents to any potential vandals. Muslims did the same and protected the Sikh temples while the Sikhs did their own night-time prayers (Kirtan Sohila). They both came together to protect churches within the city too. \s\s[Here’s the article from the local news](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-riots-muslims-and-sikhs-guard-159529) \sSikh’s are some of the nicest most generous and tolerant people I have ever met. Really good guy. Any friend would be good :/ damn - sikh mosqueGuess you could say that was really \s#SikhThis is what puts my faith back in people! Look out for each other respect one another and help each other. [deleted]That’s the problem isn’t it? It’s as if there’s a sort of carnal drive to *take* and *have*.Can someone just build is mosque ? Like obviously it looks like one but doesn’t it need an Imam or blessing or something? \sStill a cool picture. I hope he gets better God I love sikhs. My heart... this is so pure they’re so happy oh my goodness this is wonderfulheartwarming life-affirming fuckin awesomeness.That is pretty Sikh indeed.Tbh he could’ve prayed anywhere - you don’t need a mosque to prayWonderful. When our eyes are set towards heaven we are all family.Hope he gets better soon!I like the green color.Green has a special significance in Islam as it’s the color of Paradise Sikhs are lovely people in general. I don’t remember the last time i heard someone talk bad about Sikhs. Im muslim by the wayTheir whole outlook on life and religion is great. They basically believe there is no wrong way to God so are accepting of different faiths. I've known a lot a Sikhs and they are all a bunch of lovely people with one exception. But that's just because he just had a shit personality.People don't talk bad about Sikhs because they carry swords and know how to use them.\s\sJust kidding but ya my Sikh friends have always been super chill. It's a solid culture.For nicest stereotyped religious persons I think it would go Sikhs Mormons Lutherans. I’ve met some real asshole Buddhists but that could just be because I live in Colorado.As a religion they seem great. Unfortunately like many religions/religious cultures as soon as you try and marry into that religion when you aren't the same there's A LOT of issues. Sikhism especially is hard  because you cannot even convert if you wanted to you're just screwed.[removed]My dad had a Sikh at his work who assaulted a woman in the elevator. So here you go. “It would be great if human beings were great at being human and if all of mankind was made of people that were kind.”\s\sThis is it. It's nice to be nice. It's good to be good.I wholeheartedly agree. \s\sI guess the only thing left to do is find out how to delete these few pesky lines in Islamic scripture that command Muslims to either kill or convert the non-believers.This is dope!Why does this mosque look like shrek?*WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY MOSQUE??*Because it has layers. I just want stuff like this to happen everywhere.Can u build me a house plzThey do but they get overshadowed by hate in the media because that's what gets clicks. When you’re a veteran at a game and decide to help out your newbie friendWonder if the Muslim man specifically asked for it to be neon green. Bold color choice but I bet God was happy to see some flair.\s\sEdit: TIL green is associated with Islam.in South Asian cultures lots of Islamic buildings tend to be some shape of Green  usually bright green. I'm not sure why tbh.Almost all mosques I've seen in my life were green coloured. I heard it's because prophet Mohammed liked the colour green.Well my dude if I’m going to guess the Muslim man most certainly did. He wanted it to be easily visible to everyone so he could be like “yo check this out. My buddy built me a mosque just because! Fucking badass right?!” \s\sNot a Muslim but I believe what's most important is that it's plain and white from the inside which it seems to be. Big fan of the neon green though.I’m from Delhi. But I’m not Muslim. However I’ve noticed Muslim communities have a lot of green in them and even a lot of Islamic countries have green flags (Pakistan Saudi Arabia etc). It’s a really nice atmosphere in these communities especially the amazing music that rings throughout that area. Such a shame that this type of religion has the worst reputation possibleThey’re going to replace it with a better mosque in post-production That’s sik.So ge can green screen it into whatever cool pattern he wants. Green is a very prevalent colouring Islam. I cannot upvote this enough.  This isn't some fake act of kindness for internet points this is real.[deleted]Faaabulous! r/wholesomemuslimr/subsyoufellforOk this is so sweet 😭 Now if someone would just rebuild Sheryl’s she-shed for her. Wow. I simply love this picture itself. I'm actually Muslim and that grass green architectural masterpiece looks better than 9/10 mosques I've ever been to.\s\sI guess I could say I'm... \s\sGREEN WITH ENVY AHAHAH!!!Sikhs are truly wonderful people and are for the most part totally misunderstood. Sikhism is one of those religions that you just have to respect. They're like the sweet old lady that always brings cupcakes to the BBQ even though everyones fighting over family beefYeah just casually build a structure in the form of a building like ya do.Humanity goals is getting rid or religion.SiikkkhhhhhIs it made out of lime stone?I've never me a Sikh I didn't like. A letter/wordthat's not a sikh man that's the sikhest man.Human squee! Fuckin adorable!Sikh's are so based.Sikhs are kind of known for being chill like that.

Love the culture very accepting while also being warriors. This is so old.[deleted]I think it’s in the sense that without an accessible mosque Muslims (in regions where they are minorities) tend to feel like outsiders.\s\sThe mosque is literally a gesture that says “You’re welcome here. Forever.”But I’m sure it is nice to have your own little place of worship LOUD NOISES!!Friendship goals is to create a portrait of your friend made out of thousands of dice.I read “sikh” as SICCWish this was the norm and not the exception...That's pretty SikhThese kinds of folks make up most of the islamic population. As with the right-wing and left-wings only a small fringe will ever go about bombing and attacking. Most are devout and pious people. Its wise to remember that to prevent divisions and paranoia because at the end of the day we’re all people and we all deserve respect and kindness.\s\sExcept Micah. Fuck MicahTHANK YOU. I’m just a girl in high school and everyone thinks I’m out to bomb the place. Like??That picture of the hug nearly has me in tears... just looks so damn wholesome.Definitely one of the best hugs ive ever seenI know! Same here :)I hope he gets better soon\sWow I can't even get out of bed when I'm Sikh!Jew Buddha be jokingSource? Most middle eastern folks I have met are very sweet accepting people. It's a shame that they get lumped in with extremists. I think even those of us who consider ourselves left leaning even forget just how *small* a percentage of the middle eastern populace is radicalized. It's positively infinitesimal compared to the global population. Also Sikhs rule. Have met some really nice bareass naked stick welding Sikhs walking the streets of India.  \s\sI think its also easy to forget just how many different faiths coexist in these countries. They get framed as all muslim uptight and intolerant but it's just not the case. r/HumansBeingBrosCmon I expected better from this sub than anti-Islam or anti-religion comments.

Every single time I have interacted with a practicioner it has been nothing but an absolute delight. Such a wholesome collection of people.Can confirm.

I've been wanting to visit a local gurudwara recently. Is it okay if I use a bandana I have at home to cover my head? Other than covering the head and taking off the shoes is there anything else manners-wise which I should know?\s\sAnd I'll be honest langar sounds great as well. What time is it usually served? :DBy any chance do you carry a sword around with you.Sikh too! Gotta love them puns eh? Lived in New Delhi the last four years and every Sikh person I met was kind and helpful and fun. Made some lifelong friends. What religion are most Sikhs I assumed most of you were Muslim.

Sajjan Singh is the older brother of Joga Singh who is the Sikh in the photo who manages their estate back home.  When this story got on TV in 2015 about a mosque that had been destroyed during partition was being rebuilt the Ghuman family didn't understand all the fuss.  It's just bros being bros.This made me cry a little bit. It's so nice to see a bit of kindness in the world still.That dude is Sikh with it.>he had nowhere to pray\s\s\sI didn't realize Muslim people actually needed to be in a mosque in order to pray? Maybe I'm wrong but I thought as long as the person faced Mecca it was fine. \s\s\sSorry for being ignorant I'm not exactly a religion expert Yeah they can pray anywhere that is clean as long as they try to face the right direction. However its bonus points to pray together with other people which is what mosques are built to house. Subscribe to PewDiePie. Get well soonWithin the Sikh community there are good and bad. I don't buy into The notion that all Sikhs are nice and wonderful. I've been around Sikhs all my life. Many Sikhs I've met seem to have an arrogance about them. They go on about being warriors. Not much humility.\s\s I see very little interaction with others outside the Sikh or greater Punjabi community. Very little intermarriage with non Punjabis. I wonder how many Sikhs invite Gorahs or blacks into their homes? I wonder if a Gorah could actually attend a langar without any trouble? \s\s They love money so much that they import large amounts of drugs into Canada to supply the illegal drug trade. No consideration for the lives they ruin with the drugs they import.\s\sSikhism is good. How most Sikhs I've met over the years really don't practice true Sikhism in their private and public lives. It is hard to resist the lure of big money or to control one's ego. Like every thing else there the ""ideal"" version and the real version.\s\s I not slagging Sikhs. Most people regardless of religion culture or ethnicity are shitty. Few can rise up and fight their own selfishness and ego. That's life. what a sihk friend.I wish there were better people in the world like this. It is a rarity to find someone so pure and whole.[deleted]I don’t know why your getting downvoted?Someone should let that ghost know that killing the dog is the *least* spooky thing a haunting ghost could do.I want a bashful ghost as a tattoo now...If you haunt a place and let the owner knows that you are haunting the place then I'm not sure if it counts as hauntingI would want to be a helpful ghost I think.

Uh Well I'm confused because uh you know like we're supposed to believe in the ministry right? So is uh is the church and state supposed to be seperate? I'm confused cuz I never went to school. Right? Is a confused person get a resolution? I don't understand. You see when you go like that right you have a cross right. Two sticks right. And that's how I felt when I was in Waterloo. Cuz when I walked in Waterloo and smiled at people they treated me like a vampire. They used the cross and they went like this by not smiling at me. In Toronto hey hi guys you know me. Steve Spiros! Easy going!? Those who know me I'm a nobody. You understand? And you can't kill a person with no body. So why am I afraid? I'm not afraid. I'm afraid of the boogeyman who is the Boogeyman? You figure it out! I'm getting out of here. I'm going back to Waterloo where the vampires hang out! And I'm going to wear my sunglasses at night. You know why? Because women show their tits have short skirts and then they feel violated when I look at them! Why? Because I have sunglasses on and I'm weird. Uh I'm from humberside. I'm sorry if I made a fool of humberside. But all those people who called me a sleepwalker I woke up. now I'm going back to sleep because I'm going to be committed in an isolation room because I'm going back to the ministry and allow them to perceive me as I am! A fuck up! Goodbye! Hey Toronto the good. Look at the square! It was a shithole when I worked here. Now it looks like New York Manhattan! Where are the bums? There's no bums here. Toronto doesn't have bums. But Waterloo they're creating bums! They created me. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's the church. Talk to the pope he knows everything. I had it! I'm gonna die! How can you die when you're dead. Oh wait a second I'm going to be crucified right? I'm not going to raise my voice because I'm committed to the Lord.  (Rips off shirt) I love you.\s\s\sBut yeah man it's just feel good memes to brighten up someone's day.

Need more !Always appreciate the effort people put into you. After all were just trying to do our best :)I'd appreciate if ghosts would put more effort into communicating with me in a way I can clearly understand what they want but whatever *fuck me* for trying to have a proper conversation once in my lifetime right?I like this. Thank you.Reminds me of the game Haunt the House![deleted]What a cute little ghost!A stool sitting only on two legs is spooky itself. I think this subreddit has really gone down in quality. Originally this sub was about taking popular trends jokes and memes and turning them into something more positive. But now this sub could just be called ""happy stuff"". Literally anything goes as long as it's happy. My favorites are definitely the meme derivatives. Like [when you've been asleep since yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5cryo2/rise_and_shine/).I agree. At least it's still wholesome though. Exactly. Hence the ""memes"" part of the title in /r/wholesomememes.The problem with the old contents is half of the time I just don't get the references and the other half of the time it just reminds me the original cynical memes and makes me sad.SO W H O L E S O M EFor some reason I read this with the Jake and Finn voices.I don't know who does these comics but they're always so nice.LolTHIS IS SO CUTE.

I just never really got into it. \s\sI still miss him. Same here. I know him exclusively through Reddit's obsession with him but because of that (and my self-destructive tendencies to browse r/all) I found out when he had cancer I found out when he saw improvement I found out when he did an AMA and sang the meme song... And then yesterday I found out when he died. Yet somehow it hit me like a ton of bricks. It's so crazy. But I'm also relatively close to his age and recognize just how incredibly young it actually is just how much more life there was still left to live and it breaks my heart. And I also think about all the people around the world in the exact same situation except without the support of thousands of people on the internet and it breaks my heart even more. Typing this out was a bad choice because now I'm crying about some stupid TV stranger I knew almost nothing about. All of this is just stupid.I’m 31 so wasn’t in the target demographic when it came out — but it premiered right after I dropped out of high school and was completing my GED (the different tests were months apart in my area) \s\sI was flipping through channels and the visual aspect caught me especially cute little Stephanie. I think I watched every day afterward.\s\sThe music was catchy and fun and I think the message was awesome. 17 year old me may or may not have danced around the living room with that show sometimes. Watching clips on YouTube it still holds up.OOFu/ClarkStreetGang1I know its said a lot when one has nothing to say but from the deepest depths of my core  \sOof...Shit. I didn’t know he passed away. I’m gonna have to go cry in my work bathroom for a minute now. What a gem of a guy. I’m gonna miss him so much I found out earlier today and haven't been feeling right since. I watched the show as a teen with my younger siblings and he was always my favourite character. It hurts  but we can take some solace in the knowledge he is no longer in pain. Fantastic man he was RIP.I know. His performance as Robbie Rotten was truly captivating. He was hilarious and awesome and I wish he could have had more time with his family :'(Robbie Rotten used to scare the shit out of me as a kid because of all the prosthetics but he was one of the most wholesome dudes on the internet ever.

\shey.. who's cutting onionsForever number one Honestly the most wholesome meme ever. He took the meme treatment in stride and made it positive. It's very saddening that he passed at such a young age.Damn this is how I found out he died. I thought maybe he was over exaggerating when he said he was ""in a fight for his life"".\s\sRIP Mr. Rotten.I don't remember this meme at all and so I'm wondering is that where most of ya'll know him from? Or did you actually watch the show? I've seen/heard of this show but I thought it was a pretty recent children's show so I doubt many of the people on Reddit watched it as kids. Unless they're still kids. Just curious since this is all the front page has been the past 24 hours.It is so young. Too young.Nearly 2 years on I've yet to see a meme that's genuinely as enjoyable and creative as the edits this one spawned.Rip Robby Rotten\s\s\s\s\s\sNever watched the show but it's so wholesome to see his legacy.You are not my friend my friend.

Many of the people who watched it as a kid are now late teens early adulthood the main demographic of Reddit.\s\sAlso the actor is a good person.\s\sIts kinda like people being bummed over Mr Rogers dying.  He was a part of their childhood and a good person.  The guy just played an villain albeit a harmless one but villains can still be adored.""We Are Number One"" became a super popular meme towards late 2017.\s\sStefan was diagnosed with cancer during a similar time period and the Internet raised a lot of money for his chemotherapy.\s\sStefan showed a lot of love to the Internet as we helped him fight his battles a shame to see someone go so young.\s\sFuck cancer.Short version: He had cancer faught it seemed to have beaten it. It came back. It claimed him. \sThe guy was memed a lot and he was okay with it. All in all he seemed like a good person that wanted to bring joy to the people I think it's because his character of Robbie Rotten was so over the top unique hilarious bizarre etc that he became a meme and somewhat beloved by a lot of people. That and he was a nice guy that we all came to care about.Reddit is a hivemind and anything they can ""ironically"" like will be unironically liked soon enough and if it can get karma well it's gonna be everywhere *rampant sobbing*[just leaving this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/997z76/rest_in_peace_robbie/) u/chriscrow3Hi.Come on im just trying to work and look at reddit\s\sNow im sad\s\sHe was such an awesome chap :/ Rest in peaceWhat a good time to be raining into my eyesWhy does cancer kill the nicest people I'm going to cry lost someone very close to me to cancer I'll miss you Stefan you were part of my childhood ♥️Always num🅱️er 1:( Has there been any response from the cast of lazy town? Just curious I understand if they're not public about it though.MY HEARTTTT Remember that episode where the town went to the beach and left Robbie behind? He got so lonely...Stop this is to much Is it really that wholesome?Possibly the most wholesome post hereIt's too early for these kind of feels. i'm already crying :-(“You know I always thought we made the best team.” He comments.\s\sThe glowing sun a crisp circle in the bloody sky illuminated a charcoal black pathway shimmering confidently in splendour. Yet a lone figure’s worn and weary silhouette is all but jarring in my eyes.\s\s“Heh. Well I guess this is the end of the road for me.” The owner of the silhouette smiles. “Looks like you caught me in my escape.” In contrast to his fatigued figure and ragged striped uniform the galaxy-blue glimmer in his eyes seems to reflect an ocean in front of me vast and everlasting. \s\sMy arm bracers seem uncomfortable. I fidget slightly as I try to reposition them. “Not even a goodbye to the others?”\s\s“There’s no need to” he replies. “They need you more than me.”\s\s“You’re just like your name suggests” I smirk. “Rotten to the core. How cruel it will be when the others realise you’ve abandoned them without a trace?” \s\sA chuckle escapes the figure. “Well you’re nothing like your moniker. Sportacus you aren’t being a very good sport now are you?” \s\sHe lets out a hoarse laugh. “Then again who am I to judge? It’s been ten years! I know your temperament inside out - selfless and unwilling to part with those he acknowledges.”\s\s“Look Robbie I-“ Before I can get another sentence out his wilting figure walks into arms reach. My eyes are suddenly drawn to the streaks of grey barely illuminated by the sanguine rays of the sun above.\s\s“Enough. Lazytown will be fine without me.” He smiles as he puts his palm on my shoulder. “Our constant rivalry over the past decade has riled them up inspired them and changed their dull and inattentive lifestyle. My work here is done.”\s\sSomething inside of me snaps. “Isn’t that too much?” I cry out voice louder than intended. “They will never know the goodness inside you Robbie only the shell of a villain you portray yourself to be!”\s\s“And why should that matter?” He interrupts again. “As long their lives are improved whether they see me as a friend or foe I am content.”\s\s“…” I choke out words deep within me. “You know I always considered you a teammate a friend. I’m sure the others back in lazytown did too. When they grow older they will realise. Realise the influence you had on them.”\s\s“Friend huh…” He lets out an amiable smile. “I have no regrets then.” He turns and begins a leisurely stroll back onto the path.\s\sI sigh. “Will we meet again?” \s\s“…” The silence is my only answer.\s\s“Robbie… goodbye.” I try to let out a smile at my teammate’s fading figure. “Remember you will always be the number one here.”\s\sA vibrant laugh echoes in the distance. “No Sportacus as long as you remember me I will always be with you guys.”\s\s“*We* are number one.”\s\s\si'm crying!I didn't even watch the show but this made me incredibly sadF. u/ClarkStreetGangu/clarkstreetgang is Mark Valenti’s account.

Honestly when this show was on the air I legit hated it. If nothing else was on I’d just turn off the tv and go play with toys. But Stefan has been one of the coolest most wholesome guys I’ve ever seen and although Lazy Town just wasn’t a show for me this still really hurt to read.  awh no my heartThis theme actually comes across in the show. It's very clear that he feels somehow outside other and excluded and that drives a lot of his malicious behavioursFAh it's beginning to rain...what a horrible day for it too. He was genuinely the nicest person I have ever seen.I must be too old because I’ve never even heard of this show.

Here's a link to my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rustledjimmiescomic/) to check out more comics. (and thank you I'm glad you like the little potato dudes.)NoiceI guess you can say hes a loan sharkChampion of the people!What a good shark friend This is the cutest thing I've seen all dayBread... Underwater?.... YezWhat is so wrong with me that I thought this was just a ploy the shark was using to get inside and murder/eat the family?Ain't that a character from shark tale?Soggy breadBaby sha-I’m crying right now because my mom has started having neurological problems and I’m super scared right now about money and bills and this is the chuckle I needed. That panel of the old man fish is beautiful to me right now. Trying to keep myself from being too obvious because I’m in the backseat of my friends cars on the way to dinner. Is no one going to ask why a fish needs a walking cane?And the fish with the towel on its back 😂 This looks like a job for... Supershark!Smells like communist propaganda to me800ft isnt very far. https://youtu.be/hi6b5LU4mmYi hope neighbors do these kinds of things tooI feel bad for thinking that shark was gonna eat the fatherWould this be considered Metamodern?Got me thinking what do you do if you can't  buy groceries?They didn't put money in the shark's fins because then it would be a *loan shark*Omg I was just doing an ACT practice test and there was a whole reading document about loan sharksHow did they get underwater so quick?\s\sAnyone know their GoFinMe account?HAHello am fish need monieAwww that’s so nice!!!This would easily be r/thirdstagecapitalism because in real life people generally don't do thisI love this so much I hope he’s not a loan sharkFor a second I thought they used their grocery money to buy drugs from a family member instead...I thought that meant the grandpa fish had a drug problem. Took me a second.We project what is familiar so all im sayibg is we're here if you gotta get something off your shoulders This shark is an example of the bets in humanity or well sharkity \s\s I don’t know whatever you call it he’s a pretty good bro.Does anyone else find it weird that we're laughing at the fact that some people are forced to chose between medicine and food?\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThank fuck i'm Canadian.Amen.WhyGrandpa fish has a walking stick even though he doesn't walk they should sell it so they can afford some groceries By looking at the conversation of the couple the struggle looks real. I love that the fish is wearing a tie.G A S H U N KOh my God I want to hug this comic!What are the pills supposed to mean? Is this part of the joke? I'm confused as to why they're in the comic or if I'm missing somethingr/wholesomesharksr/subsIfellforSo sad it's not real :(Lol this is adorable 😂But then I think to myself the shark helped support the family for maybe a week or two two max but what happens after that? Does the shark continue to give support or does the fish family continue by themselves living paycheck to paycheck?Hopefully they can get by this tough period and live happily ever after by their own What this doesn't show you is that the shark not only provided groceries for the week but also ate the old sick fish.  Ridding the family of both issues in one visit.Hopefully the Ocean Kingdom soon realizes that it’s a lot cheaper and more efficient if they all pool their money through taxes to support sick ocean creatures...Sometimes all you need is a bit of a break in the clouds to remind you the sun is still there even if you can't see it right now. They struggle until pops passes away and then it gets a little easier.\s\sWell they already know how to fish ammirite?Well the shark comes back to see if the father has kicked his pill addiction (or is at least trying) and if not eats him - thus freeing them of mostly likely the main problem in their lives.I think the stinky truck was more than he expectedI think a hollow appeared behind the camera and Quincy is like ""today of all days!

\sThat kid is clearly not a professional and can't hold a smiling face as he inhales the smell of trash. The other guys are pros [😎🤢😎]i've never seen a more accurate emoji depiction.It'll be funny to see how Quincy reacts to this 10 years after 😂Man it's always good thing seeing professional sports players do community work.Can someone explain to me why so little kids are obsessed with garbage trucks? And why/when this obsession stops? I find it highly curious that they struggle to fill their positions. Despite it being an important (and not badly paid?) work...There is a video documenting it from CNN. \s\s[YT Link](https://youtu.be/HQ2nNWJp3sg) I love this sub. Having a bad night and you see things like this that make you smile. Lol that kid isn't overwhelmed he's scared asf.Scared of what?Damn Turk and Cutty fell on hard times. Wholesome as fuck[deleted]Yeah when I saw the kid's face I got the feeling that what overwhelmed him was the smell... You try driving behind a garbage truck for any given time you'll smell that sweet rotten stench of garbage.\s\sBut hey they're necessary and as a society we pay them well (maybe not enough) and this kid saw them as heroes! Now they're just kinda like smelly heroes though. [deleted]noAfter I saw this when it was first posted I had remembered it one day when the trash men were coming by my place.\s\sI took my kids out there so they could watch the big trash truck crush all the garbage and back and meet the guys.  I think they were as excited as my kids were.  It was really nice.In my town the driver controls an arm on the side of the truck that picks up the can dumps it and sets it back down.. driver never gets out from behind the wheel truck does it all. . . \s\sAnd the SOB still leaves the can 1/2 way out in the street afterwords....Better than the alternative \s\shttps://youtu.be/dvJfqWaN3YYThis is my favorite imageThis kid is too pure for the world 😩😭😢Those guys aren't garbage men. They're heroes.As a mommy to a garbage truck obsessed 3 year old this makes me smile! I wonder if our garbage men would stop for him? wtf i have that sweatshirt it's like a child's xxlWhen SETI used part of the Australian National Telescope Facility all members of the team were given little thankyous for their work. Including the people who emptied the bins. That seemed strange to me except nope I'm full of shit that's totally sensible. The bins being emptied is as necessary as anything else. I had that truck!Haha awww! This is so cute. It reminds me of the little girl who loved the garbage man so much she brought him a cupcake one day and it happened to be his birthday :) So sweet. I like how he's holding it like a machine gun. Im melting its too wholesomeBuddeehhI wish no one had ever told me as a kid that ""you don't want to be a garbage man"". \s\sBullshit. It's a *very* good career. Garbagemen and Sanitation Workers in general are so important for public health that we often forget. So many people treat it like it's some low job but damn do I respect them.It must be awesome for those guys to know that SOMEBODY loves them. When I was around that age I wanted so much to be a garbage man.\s\sRiding on the back of the truck holding on to a bar as (in my head) it speeded like a F1 car through the streets only thing keeping you from brutal death your superhero like strength.\s\s It looked like the coolest thing ever for me. Its actually kind of a fun job. I did it for a few months and some guys make a career out of it and make some serious cash. I lived your dream and you missed out. Remember its never too late.Well it would be if you discount the smell. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Same!! My dream as a child was definitely to be able to ride on the back of a garbage truck lol. Nice to see this kid keeping his expectations realistic. Now that's pretty fucking cute!Didn't know Michael Bennett was a part time garbage manSo sweet!No way I would have a beard like that if I were hauling garbage all day.  Can't do it.The sanitation folks\s\sAre jolly friendly blokes\s\sCourteous and easy going.\s\sThey'll mop up when you're overflowing.\s\sAnd tell you when your arse is showing.\sHey /u/lvdybird\s\s\sThis is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.This is so pure and innocent; it's beautiful.Where I live its customary to always leave a 6 pack on the top of your bin on bin day leading up to Christmas for these guys always so friendlyWhen I was his age my dream was to become a garbage man. I would always watch them when they drove by.I do agree. This always makes me smile when it pops up online This is so dear. Thank you for posting!We've all wanted to hang off the back of a garbage truck. My sister saw this post about a year ago. She's had it has her background ever since I keep asking her when she'll change it she seems to like the crying kid.Sorry but this post is a pile of RUBBISH Oh c'mon! This guy is clearly making a joke (garbage truck pile of rubbish get it?) and not critiquing the post. Downvoting him is just mean. He's going to end up down in the dumps. (See another on-topic joke.)I'm a bit late to this party but Quincy is the man. Good on that little guy for deciding to engage with people who he viewed as larger than life.\s\sIt's okay that he was crying a bit. :)Quincey is the fuckin' man!So there was this one time I wandered off into Calgary following a garbage truck....\s\s\s\sRoll back the clock to the death of the 80's. 1989 in fact. I was but a toddler and I loved the garbage trucks. LOVED THEM.\s\sThe awesome feat of lifting a giant bin only to dump it's contents in the back....INTOXICATING (to a 3 year old).\s\sBoth my mother and father debate how it came about but one of them fucked up and left the screen door unlocked. From there I saw the most amazing of beasts....The Garbage truck. \s\sIn my mad pursuit of this majestic creature I apparently traveled nearly 6 city blocks and ended up on some overpass where by chance one of my mother's good friends found me and returned me home.\s\sBringing up that adventure only spurs a 3 decade old fight so I don't talk much about it and being young my memory of it is faint at best but I do recall bits and pieces.\s\s\sTLDR: I should be dead because young me loved garbage trucks.\s\s\sIf I only read the TLDR I would have some serious questions. Did you get in the compactor part of the truck? Hide in a bin to get inside the truck? Run straight in front of the truck to give it a big ol' hug? Lol[deleted]Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennett_(defensive_lineman_born_1985)#/media/File%3AMichael_Bennett_(defensive_lineman)_2014.JPG\s***\s^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^88938I grew up in Memphis Tennessee and I was fascinated by the Garbage Men as a little boy. I loved those guys! They seemed like the coolest guys that I had ever seen.  They were so nice and friendly to a little white boy in a middle class neighborhood. They had nothing to gain from being nice to me and smiling at me as if I were the least bit important to their lives. I don't know if it is very well known but Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was in Memphis in support of the Utility Workers Strike when he was murdered. One of the issues was that only white men were allowed to be the drivers of the garbage trucks. That was 1968 and I was in the Army by then and far from Memphis Tennessee. I still hold a deep affection for garbage men (and women!!). The garbage man can. 'Cause he mixes it with love? How does he do it?AND DO THE TWISTY THINGY TOO! Of course he can! It's garbage can. Not garbage cannot. This better be the top comment tomorrow wow i can see why he worships them... they look like such great guys!Brings me back to a time where I was fascinated and intrigued by normal events.\s\sThis picture makes me slow down and enjoy the smaller things in life.Always remember we all casually can say that a car that goes 120 mph isn't that fast of a car but for tens of thousands of years of human history up until a short 100 odd years ago the only people who ever went that fast were falling to their deaths. We live in a magical world and time.What's overwhelming his is the horrible stench that he knew nothing of before. Oh my goodness my heartstrings are being tugged out. So stinking adorable!!!!!!This was me as a kid. (just to clarify I am not the child in the picture I just loved the garbage men when I was young...) I told my mom that when I grew up I wanted to be a garbage man. I loved that they got to hang on to the back of a truck when it was moving and I always loved watching them squish the trash. Anyways a few years ago I was in my old neighborhood and the garbage men were going by and they stopped me. ""Hey I remember you!! We used to always save up the trash from the block so you could watch us squish it. It was the best part of our day"" That was a pretty cool moment.My cousin was terrified of the bin man. She'd hear him coming down he road and hide behind the sofa. I don't remember if she had a reason or not but she was 3-4 years old.Garbage men are the best. We always put out drinks in a bucket of ice for them when it's hot out.That's pretty freaking awesome.I wanted to be a Garbage man for all the same reasons. Plus I thought they only worked 1 day a week.I was the exact opposite. Garbage truck used to scare the shit out of me. Made me cry. My mom would put me out there as punishment when the truck would come. In addition to getting to hang out OUTSIDE A MOVING VEHICLE they also had only to work once a week as far as my 6yo self could tell. This is so cute According to my folks I wanted to be a garbage man when I was little as well! I guess there is just something about the truck that appealed to me. Very cool the garbage men recognized you and ya'll had a moment.I was the same way as a kid. The garbage men never met me though as I lived in Detroit and wasn't allowed outside without my parents.me too.  for a while we just put lawn trimmings and yard waste off to the side of the street and they would come by with a triangle shaped scoop that split down the middle when it opened.  when i was a kid that was the coolest thing i had ever seen.Hey why don't you get the fuck out of here with that awesome story and join us over at r/WholesomeMemes So did you follow your dreams and become the greatest trash man of them all?What did you end up becoming when you grew up?I too wanted to be a garbage man when I was a kid. My mom and sister still bring it up to this day but I remember being absolutely fascinated by their equipment. I loved watching the arm on the side of the truck grab each can and elevate it to the top of the truck while dumping all the crap out. Dunno why but i was absolutely entranced by that. Possibly because it vaguely reminded me of Power Ranger megazords or something. I was the same as a kid always ran out to watch and wave to the garbage man when he came by. Since I was young it was always a big mechanical arm that came out and picked the bin up and dumped the contents in a hole at the top of the truck. Looked awesome.\s\sAnyway one day the garbage man got out of his truck with his lunch box and gave me his banana which he would have otherwise had for lunch. What a guy! I love it. My sisters and I used get excited about the ""poop man"" coming to clean out our septic tank. We didn't have a real garbage truck in our town...Yeeees. They remembered you even after your appearance changed?It stinks (pun intended) that it's a tough job to get due to bureaucracy. Then you would have loved the day they threw our old oven into the truck and pancaked itThat's pretty cool those same guys were still working those routes all those years later. Garbage men make good money too.Same I used to run to the window every week to see the Garbage Man come. Or that's what my mother tells me I was very young at the time so I only remember the tail end of it.I wanted to be a garbage man as a kid too. I just wanted to ride on the back of the truck.So they were your heroes and you were their hero? That's amazing. I had the exact same feeling as you as a kid. Thanks for sharing and bringing back memories.Did you get to ride on the truck with them?When I was still in kindergarden my parents did advertisement for the municipal garbage disposal. We had a clean [wheeled garbage bins](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/wc-prod-pim/JPEG_1000x1000/BL392683_mastec_wheelie_garbage_bin_120l.jpg) for a photoshoot and got to keep it. It was my favourite toy I always turned it sideways and used it as a cave. And my mom still likes to tell me about how much I loved the garbage trucks.\s\sThe part that stayed was my love for big vehicles first agricultural ones (my uncle had a farm) and then [tanks](http://imgur.com/a/XMXvz).wow that's awesomeThis is so damn cute. Those garbage men are so cool to take a picture with the kid. But god I love how genuinely terrified from pure nervousness he is upon meeting his ""heroes"". So. Cute. Awesome picture and story The garbage men on my street ran over my skateboard - I think they did it in purpose. I was watching them through the window it was on our lawn which they backed up into to make a turn on our dead end street :( this happened to my kid. He cried when he finally got to sit in a tow truckI love how easy it is to make kids dreams come true. Just today my daughter declared she wanted a mixed fruit smoothie pouch and to play games on her dads phone. Like out of all the things she could do she was most excited for these two things ❤️ They never told me that kids can kill you with their cuteness. When I saw a guy dressed up as Batman promoting the movie outside of a store I was so star struck I cried and made my mother stand on the other side of the street so we could just watch him for a bit. I was too scared to actually go take a photo as I was terrified I'd embarrass myself in front of Batman. During the emergency awareness festival thing or any really town festival kids always love to sit in the fire trucks ambulances and police car. It's so adorable to see the mix of over excitement and nervousness. \s\sLetting them turn on the lights or sirens is hillarious. Eyes soooo big. Waste disposal technicians*When I was a kid I wanted to drive the ""cement truck."" I still do except I am too old and decrepit. I love concrete and think it is the coolest thing ever invented. Well except maybe the [linotype.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gQasrMBALA)\s\sGarbage truck guys need to get paid way more than they do. as a garbage man these kids make my day. \si have a kid on my route that comes out with his grandparents and has printed out pictures of trucks i need to buy that kid a toy truck.\sPlease do man he's gonna love it! Source?This reminds me of the video of these little kids giving two garbage men something to drink and it's incredibly wholesome i found a link :) https://youtu.be/ae5wtZYLQbUOh mha gawd <3That neighborhood though.Oh my word... that's the cutest thing I've seen in along time!My boyfriend just ran into the bathroom cause he heard me crying in here and thought I slipped getting out of the shower but nope  just ugly crying over this video. Aaaand I'm crying. Damn there are so many videos like that brings joy to one's heartThe cuteness and humanity in this is almost overwhelming.My grandpa and i followed the truck for about an hour driving straigt behind them. Yea He was the best. Great now I'M crying...When my son was a little tyke he LOVED to go meet the garbage men every week.  They were his heroes and they were so nice to him.  One day I was in the middle of changing his diaper and he went running out to meet them buck naked.  They laughed told him to go put some pants on.  We lived at the end of a dead end street and they would take a break there.  I'd often take them iced tea or water.  Nice memories!Being a Garbage man is a respectable career.I will never understand the stigma of being a ""garbage man"". They provide an important service and make pretty good money.Not that I agree there should be one but the stigma comes from the fact they're working with generally dirty garbage all day.This is how we take back the internet from the haters. Keep spreading that love <3.You're really optimistic I like you! That's totally a reasonable expectation really and a worthy cause! I agree that rudeness jealousy spite fear sadness and anger and really the greater part of the human condition if we're being honest are things to be avoided on the internet and silenced if possible. We all deserve to be protected right?  \s  \sPersonally if I am not shielded from all but the fuzziest of fuzzies I go to my sad place and might go back up on the roof again. I wouldn't be here on the internet if I wanted any part of the real world haha! So let's ""take back"" this place not in the sense that it was ours originally but in the sense of taking something backward and reverting to an earlier state like infancy. The internet should be like a womb but with inspiring photos and comics with no punchlines (punchlines are violent)<3 <3The wholesome revolution! This post is a lie. That boys toy is a recycling truck. My son has the same one.This is so adorable. My son has the same garbage truck toy. He runs around finding smaller toys to load it up with as garbage.this is the sweetest thing i've seen all day omg!When you are a kid these trucks are awesome.  Rjght next to the trucks that clean up roads.Awww. I hope there would be more kids like him.~This just makes me feel bad. Looks like the kid is terrified. Or his nose is overwhelmed by the smell of the truck.I've seen this about hundred times nowLooks like someone's being forced to pose for a picture so their parents can get imaginary internet pointsI'm sure that made their day tooWatching kids be fascinated with our equipment is one of the most rewarding things at my job. Even the hardass tough guys will crack a smile and wave to them!Where i live garbage men dont even exist anymore... they use that claw thingy to pick up the garbage and thats it. Lol awesomeSo nice!Literally just saw the episode of Community where Troy meets his hero and does the same thing lolShit my eyes are watering I don't know...this meme seems a bit forced.Because its captions are more descriptive than spicy? I disagree but I still want you to have a great day. \s\sEdit: or maybe the use of quotation marks got you? men aren't that bad..Garbage-men are some of the most admirable people in the world it's sad we hold bankers and property developers in higher regard than these public service man and women. Is that Michael Bennett on the right? Micheal Bennett is that you? can we please talk about the face that is a little left and upward of where the little kid is....That's precious I like trains. Once as my train was pulling into the station I waved my hand to flag it down. Obviously it was going to stop anyway. When the engine reached me the motorman smiled and waved back. :)Here come the downvotes but I think the only thing the kid is overwhelmed by is the smell of the garbage. Look at his face!Why is /r/wholesomememes reposting from /r/imgoingtohellforthisIs he making that face because of the smell?https://imgur.com/665HXcH[deleted]What makes you say that? (I'm near Cincy and am curious what gives it away.)Oh my goodness this is just so lovely. I'm saving this for when I have a bad day. \s\sCheers my friend!Doesn't it just fill your heart with so much joy?? I hope you never have another bad day again. You're human and it sucks to be down. I wish you the best and for you to always look at this post when you're happy so you're even happier. Makes you wondering why Denziel Washington's character in ""Fences"" kept bitching about it.Oh my god this is seriously my all time favorite picture. It makes me smile every time it comes up. And occasionally if my hormones are acting fucky cry.Thought I was missing the joke but then I saw what subreddit this was :)Nobody's going to read this but... \s\sSo when I was a kid my best friend's dad was a garbage man. Occasionally he'd bring home a bike or some toys or some shit. He'd say he found them in the trash and my friend would be grossed out bitching and whatnot. \s\sIt wasn't until I was an adult that I realized that his dad was just pulling his leg just to get a rise out of him. He was saving up his money to buy his son gifts but claiming to have found them in the garbage so nobody felt bad about him spending his limited income on toys for his son.  d'aaaaaaaw.ReadI read this and it warmed my heart. This sub is really helpful after reading all the depressing shit in the news. Besides the crap of HLN this is also a very sweet video https://youtu.be/gGZr3p3RtzoI've only every had one interaction with my neighborhood's garbage man but it was a good one. \s\sOne day the garbage man saw me in the front yard with my dog while he was across the street and he called out to me. I turned and he threw me a tennis ball. I noticed he had a bunch of them in his windshield. I thanked him and played fetch with my dog until the truck came closer and my pup booked for the front door because the noise spooked him [it still does]. The guy got a laugh out of that asked me about my dog told me he was the most beautiful dog he'd ever seen and went on his way.When I was a kid I used to like skateboards and always waited and watched the garbage truck. One day I saw it and immediately ran outside and got on my skateboard and chased it down the guy on the back kinda looked like tony hawk (at least I thought he did). He stops and says hi to me and asked if I wanted compact the trash and he actually fucking  let me do it. Was a cool ass feeling at the time.That's so wonderful[deleted]I'm a union ""garbage man"" in NYC (not DSNY but private carting). My union covers traditional garbage which is food waste and demolition construction recycling which is what I do. Top guys earn $130-$150k per year depending on overtime.  Yes we work a lot but we also get a lot of downtime and PTO.  I left a corporate career and never looked back 5 years ago. Since working in this field I was able to pay off my student loans buy a condo and travel the world.  Everyone thought I was crazy when I made the shift but the things this opportunity allows me to do has muffled most of the comments I was hearing. I have top health coverage discounted auto insurance a secure pension and 5 weeks paid vacation plus 10 sick and personal days. \s\s\sMy childhood buddy's dad was a garbage man. They always had a decent living. They weren't getting Maserati's at 16 but we were all BMXers so he definitely got a new chain when his broke where I was piecing together chains from old broken chains when mine broke.  \s\sHis dad's retired now without a worry in the world. Growing up I always heard the garbage men got paid more than teachers.\s\sI think it was to exemplify how low teachers were paid under the incorrect assumption garbage men were paid low.What you said reminded me of Leslie Knope!The great thing about being a garbage man in my area is that they have a route and as soon as they finish the route they get to go home. If they finish it in 6 hours they get paid for 8. Not only is it incentive to get the job done quickly but it also allows many of them to work multiple jobs or even multiple routes. You can get paid for 16 hours of labor by working a 10-12 hour day. Not a bad gig. \s\sThe down side for me is that they go as fast as they can often handling my trash cans pretty rough braking off the handles and cracking them as they throw them on to the street after being emptied. My wifes dad is a garbage man and does other miscellaneous shit for the township like gardening and plowing snow. \s\sHe gets tons of paid vacation makes decent money. He always says he likes it. He gets to drive the high tech grabby truck now but he drove a regular truck and rode the back too.Yeah! People say shit like ""If you don't study you'll become a garbage man!"" And meanwhile I'm like Those earn a minor killing!!!Our town is switching to automated (both trash and recycling starts next week) and it sucks thinking that people are going to be out of jobs.Not anymore.  Garbagemen don't even have to leave the truck.Hey Peter watch your bungholeMen at work yah?I don't like being outside...Yeah but you also have to handle garbageThese folks are the only thing standing between us and Idiocracy.You just won a subscriber. I need to follow this sub to take the edge off. Life can make us so pessimistic sometimes I've told this story before but when I was home from college one summer I got pretty close with the garbage guys at my parents house after offering to randomly smoke them up one day. That turned into me offering them gatorades or water or beers depending on the time and day. Those garbage men still do the rounds in my parents neighborhood. They even helped us get a dumpster for free when my parents renovated their house. Do you know how much cheaper it is when contractors don't have to bring or contract a dumpster on their own? Befriend public servants people. You never know when they'll help you out. That made me cry. I've seen this before and always find it so very heartwarming :)I think it happened in real life actually.This makes me happy. Life doesn't do that to me so often. Reminds me of this lovely video: [Madeleine is happy to see the train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvpCmKUo1Aw)Underrated vital profession.   Let's give a shout out to the men hauling hot garbade all day.  Insanely rough job.\s\sP.s.  when women call for equality in all office jobs/CEO positions they always seem to forget about equality when it comes to hauling trash!  Funny how that works[removed]Here in Chicago garbage men make on average 70K a year. There's no doubt it's a tough job but I wouldn't say it's ""underrated."" They're getting paid accordingly. My son adores the garbage man. I've set reminders on my phone to look out for it every week and he races outside to watch. I've noticed they started saving up the trash in the front loader just so they can dump it in the back when they get to our house.These guys don't get enough creditSanitation workers are often not even seen as people and seen as more of an annoyance. They do a very important job and it must be awesome having something like this brighten their day. I had to read a book called Picking Up by Robin Nagle about sanitation workers in New York for an anthropology class and it gave me a completely new perspective on these men and women how hard they work how they are treated and how important and dangerous their job is.  \s\sMan who sees garbage men as an annoyance?? I have so much damn trash I cannot WAIT for those guys to come by. I've never seen my garbage man's face but I honor him every week by spacing my recycling and refuse the require distance.I think garbage business used to be run by the Mafia in New York....Awww he looks a little gassy too. Lol Holy Fuck. Is that guy on the right the restaurant owner Chef Ramsey roasted in his kitchen nightmares show???Its good to see that this new generation of kids are realistic about there futures. I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up and now I live in my moms basement.I think my favorite video ever is that little girl and her family giving Gatorade to the trash man and the one little girl runs up to the garbage man and insists he picks her up. It's so heart warmingFrom my experience I learned Garbage Men are pretty cool dudes.Is that Malcolm Jamal Warner in the right? LolUnless... My god the Garbage Men are revolting and they're holding the boy for ransom!Look at that joy in their faces he made their day more than they made his. When I was a kid I wanted to be king of the garbage men. I had grand ambitions of starting as a garbage man and working my way up. Seeing this reminded me of those years of my life and has really made me very happy so thank you. The garbage man from the private company that picks up the trash when I go on vacation is overwhelming~~ly hot~~ I get you Quincy.When I was a kid I wanted to be a garbage man because I thought they only worked one day a week.Same here Been there before little boy! Generally when everything is so wonderful I just can't believe my luck to be present... ^_^I loved getting the mail as a kid so the mailman was my hero. One morning I was in the bath tub and I heard someone downstairs say that the mailman was coming up the street. So I ran down stairs and out the front door butt naked to grab the mail before the mailman put it in the mailbox. Good thing it was warm out last Monday. I like turtles too.I just finished watching a Ted talk by Mike Rowe about respecting work and making the jobs we need into the jobs people want.\s\sThen this is at the top of reddit.\s\sQuantum theory of the universe.My brother's son is like this. And construction machines garbage trucks and so on makes him just stand there in awe. He's still pretty young so he's just started speaking basic words but he knows the words for digger and similar. \s\sA couple of weeks ago we were watching a nearby construction site where a digger was loading rocks and dirt into a dump truck. He's just watching mouth open huge eyes. \s\sThen I guess the guy in the digger sees them because after filling up the truck he drives the digger over to where they're standing and climbs out. I think that's the point that the kid realized that there's a person driving it. He looks so amazed. So mesmerized. \s\sThe man asks my brother if his kid would like to sit in it. So my brother climbs up and sits down with his kid in his lap. It's the most precious photo I have of them. I'm not sure who is most excited. My brother for getting to do that for his kid the kid for getting to be inside a digger or the worker for getting to make their day. Gonna need to see this picture I get so nervous when my kid talks about diggers in public.I briefly drove a truck for a bakery when i got out of the navy. It paid better than the garbage men. There was a guy who was saving every dollar to buy his own garbage trucks and he had uploaded videos to YouTube of the garbage men in his neighbourhood dooing their run.\s\sI really hope he gets that truck Garbage men are dope. I was hauling bags of grass from my back yard to the curb in my house rushing to get them to the street in time for pickup and they pulled up before I finished. A couple came to the back and helped me carry the rest. I'm gonna be sure to leave them some ice cold Gatorade next time.They're just a couple fellow Americans tryna make a living by making our living easier. Essential service. When I was in my early teens I tried to wheel our trash can out as they pulled up. The can hit a bump and landed on its side and I couldn't pick it back up. One of them came and picked it up for me.\s\sThank you random garbage man in VA for helping a young teen who couldn't lift a trash can.[deleted]We live on different planets. A bag of grass by my rubbish would be enough for the whole lot to not be collected. That's if they can be bothered to collect it in the first place.Nobody appreciates the garbage men until they go on strikeLooked like he was overwhelmed by the smell coming off the truck?He just wanted a picture of the garbage men! You can't disappoint a picture!Garbagemen were my heroes at that age too. :)Some people might look down on garbage men but they do an important job work hard get paid pretty well (at least in my area) and are respected by little kids around the world.[meanwhile Slovene president](https://youtu.be/dWxgQAwOJhU)Holy shit this is insanely cute.Haha I love this! When I was a little girl the garbage man let me and my sisters sit in his truck. There were steering wheels on both sides I will never forget how amazed I was :)This is so sweet and pure and makes me so happy for its sentiment but sad at the same time that adults can't have this same innocence and acceptance of our own people. Sanitation workers should be highly respected as they do the work other people don't want to worry about and do so politely. \sSeeing the smiles and the kid's face just gets me every time. Such a lovely moment captured. This picture always makes me so happy. He must be so happy to be able to show them his super fricken cool garbage truck. They must be so happy to know that this kid looks up to them so much. It's so adorable. I love it. The man on the right looks like Darryl from the office!What? He really doesn't.He looks more like Michael Bennett from the SeahawksThis is such a sweet picture omgQuincy's like I don't fuck with youuuuuuDid he piss himself?Garbage men are unsung ""heros"".  I would not do that job the smell alone would kill me but also my back knees and the rest of my body thank me for not choosing that career.\s\sAs a conservative (*uh oh*) it's virtually the only job/career I feel deserves a union and all the benefits they can get from us disgusting humans.\s\sNote: I only said Garbage *Men* because I have never once witnessed a woman doing the job. If there are ladies I apologize.Here the garbage men are on the same union as the rest of the civil service people. Same pension and everything. Most civil service jobs here are things people would hate doing. Or the smell of the truck haha*i told Pierce a thousand times  I just wanted a picture.... You can't disappoint a picture*I love all the stories in this thread about kids who love their garbage men. I always feel like garbage men are underrated by most people. Their jobs are more dangerous (statistically) than police or firefighters and every bit as vital to keeping our society safe and running smoothly. They really are heroes.You.Way too adorable. Can't handle it!This gets me every time The guy on the right looks exactly like Michael Bennett from the Seahawks.Garbage men in Germany or at least in my city earn a good amount of money since they're employed by the government. However they have to fight with a lot of restrictions. When on duty they can't stop and do take a photo with a kid like in that picture :(\s\sBut they still get a lot of money.this is so sweet omgahem garbage fightersI have twin three year olds- they also love the sanitation workers! These guys are awesome- they wave at us sometimes honk the horn for us. I love them.Im not crying I just have something on both of my eyes. An eyepatch or two?Felt this shit deep down in my fucking heart :)  either that or I just found out I have arrhythmia.   Ya know I was fine until the last part. Dammit! I’m glad you found another one. Maybe there’s more.Obligatory u/fuckswithducksI was surprised when he wasn't already here. That guy has a sixth sense for these kinds of postsHe hasn’t been active in like two weeks. Hope nothing has happened. And me? :(Came to the comments and was a little disappointed.I had to sort to controversial in order to finally find this comment. Nice. I had to check to make sure this post wasn't made by him.I knew this kid in highschool! I saw that on his FB and was bawling Crying at the club rnVEry dankEAm I the only one who is also thinking of this?\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5d8pVg3QtgNo tbh I already knew what video it was b4 I clicked on the linkI was thinking of This Is Us and (context-free spoiler) the coffee cup in the Jeep.My Dad who was an avid golfer died on May 31 of this year. We thought we had cleaned up all of his practice balls from his yard. However my Mom still hits at least one every time she mows. I have been finding them in my house car etc. I have been hearing Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Knicks in particular everywhere lately. My Dad was a huge fan and I was going to be his and Mom's dd for their show Oct. 3. Now it will be me my mom my little brother and a portrait.My dad died the day before I left for college. My mom dad and I played a game where we hid a fake rubber cockroach in increasingly  ridiculous places in the bathroom. It had been lost for a while because my dad had forgotten where he had hid it (chemo side effect probably). The night he died we came home and I forget why but my mom needed baby powder for some reason--picked up the bottle and was surprised so bad by the fake cockroach falling out of the lid that she threw the bottle and the entire bathroom was COVERED. My dad won that game hands down forever. Amazing :) There’s lots of posts about rubber ducky’s on r/lawofattractionMy Dad had a little rubber ducky called Fred who he kept in his car. He found Fred in his garden one day and thought he was cute and so he drove with Fred for good luck. He died 12 years ago and I don't know what happened to Fred which makes me really upset. Miss you Dad. I really hope someone wouldn't fabricate that kind of story for internet points. But then again I'm quite the cynic.Big if trueThis will be me as an old man no doubt in my mind if you ever find ducks while taking a walk....\s\sOr even take a walk....\s\sWhat's fresh air?is somebody cutting le onions?Wow! I can almost hear that rubber duck saying ""good luck"" while you squeeze it you know instead of a simple ""quack""I'm not crying. You're crying! <3I have something in both my eyes...This will get lost in the comments but my dad loves to leave spare change everywhere in my house mostly my shoes. He knows I hate change and it pisses me off and I get mad when I find it. After seeing this I’m not gonna be so mad anymore and I’ll probably laugh at it now. I'm sitting here with my Dad. He just finished radaition for stage 4 prostate cancer. 76 yrs old career coast guard Vietnam veteran. \sHe's my best friend and I am terrified of the day he's gone... \sThis hit me hard. . . In an awesome way. \sI wonder what things my crazy Dad will leave for us to find. Best. \sYou rock OP. I'm sorry but why was he always finding rubber ducks?Near end of house party. Fall or winter so the cast iron wood stove was burning and throwing off heat to counteract the patio door being open almost constantly. Still a dozen or so people in living room\s\sPassed out friend staggers up wobbles over to the corner and proceeds to send billowing clouds of pee-steam sizzling off said stove. The room cleared out quickly\s\sHe was the host tho so nobody made a big deal of it. Of course he had no recollection the next day  \s\s\s  EDIT: LOL this was supposed to be on another thread about the weirdest thing you've ever seen at a party but I'll leave it here for funLol I was about to post this in r/ARedditorTellsAStory till your edit. Don't delete it it's awesome finding weird shit like this in random threads/r/lostredditorsOh wow. I was so confused because I just came from that thread. Good story thoughI just came from that thread so I read it and didn't quite realize I wasnt still there for a moment.In bubberducky you get to play AS bubberducky.I always wonder if these ""I'm crying"" comments are genuine. God I hope not. This year will be four years since my father passed.  Hit me straight at the heart strings with the duckies. Keep on quaking Dad. That's sad my Great Grandfather had a collection of obscure salt and pepper shakers and it's sad to see them still there but not him. So you haven’t opened your backseat cupholder for 4 years?I mean that’s pretty believable if you don’t have a lot of people in your car very often. I can't believe in 4 years someone wouldn't clean out their car. I always clean my cup holders because they get all damp from drinks. When I was a teenager in the late 90’s I had a corny little website I had written in html (lots of Papyrus but no blink tag at least) and I used it to showcase lists of things I liked and my dopey journal-type writing. I had a small collection of vinyl records so I added a LP wishlist to my website for all five of my readers to see. \s\s A few years after I finished high school I was living across the country and I got a copy of Cream’s Disraeli Gears in the mail from my dad with a note saying that he liked it too and he was happy to get it for me from my list. I kept the record in the taped-up plastic sleeve since my record player was broken and then I kind of forgot about it. \s\sI also collect pressed pennies from tourist destinations. You know the ones you pay fifty cents and a machine squishes a design into a penny? When my dad visited me in Colorado I took him to all the sights and we got pennies pressed at each one.\s\sAnyway. A couple of years go by he is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and dies nine months later. Pancreatic cancer is brutal. More time passes and I finally get a new record player. The bright cover of the Cream record catches my eye and I open the sleeve.\s\sA pressed penny for a state park near his home falls out. My dad passed away from cancer too. This just made me start sobbing. Much love to you.Goddamn these comment are making me sad. My mom may potentially have a cancer or some other disease (nonstop period bleeding that resulted in anemia) and I'm not prepared for that shit.Right time to leave this threadThat is so sweet. How nice to find a gift from Dad in heaven. /u/fuckswithducks What a lucky duck*evil rubber duck laughing*I did something like that for a girlfriend once. We’ve just gotten together and where deeply in love. I had to take a 30 days trip for work so I hid little love notes throughout her house so she could find during that period like inside a closed matchbox I knew she’d have to open or a pack of soap she was eventually going to use. She really liked it.Big if true Big if trueMy dad used to hide away quarters in film canisters . It took a while to find them all . It’s really nice to find a few bucks randomly and know it was dad who did it I'm really loving all of these stories of dads and grandpas who left things behind it's really touching. Keep 'em coming people!No! You are crying!I wanna do thisGuess the good luck wore off on ol pops eh?I did something similar for my ex when i was moving away i hid a fuck ton of notes on fond memories with her around her house. figured it was a good way to stay connected. While we didnt last this is still a good memory.I instantly teared up.  \sBbl buying an assortment of rubber ducksHello!

I'm disappointed in myself now.I can think of one person who will definitely be remembered this wayThis is cute but where was this guy taking walks that he just *found* rubber ducks? Lol [A container full of them fell off a ship in 1992 and they washed up everywhere and taught oceanographers about currents.]( https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/what-can-28000-rubber-duckies-lost-at-sea-teach-us-about) Well it wasn't just any ordinary walk.  It was a wild goose chase!Probably around u/fuckswithducks 's houseSome places hold ""rubber duck races"" in creeks and streams.  Hundreds or thousands are released at once with numbers on them.  It's usually a charity raffle and the winner gets a prize.  \s\sExample:  \s\sSell 1000 ducks for $5 each for a charity run and the winner gets a $500 iPad.  ( = $4500 for the charity)Maybe he meant that the dad found them in stores.\s\sLike he walks past a second-hand shop and decides to go inside to look around and finds a rubber duck.This is cute until you realize he was stealing toys from the neighborhood children.  Man I can’t hardly go on a walk without finding a rubber duck. What are you talking about? Bathtubs?Maybe some guy dropped a rubber duck once then saw how happy he was to find one and think of it as good luck and stuff so he decided to leave more rubber ducks in the area at random to make him happyRubber ducks are weird man. My brother started renting a room with a terribly overgrown garden. We helped him get rid of the 3m tall brambles. In the process we found 17 rubber ducks in various colours (as well as an old engine block a 2 piece ladder and an overgrown barbeque)ikr! I assume instead that the post was written a bit wrong and meant to inply that he pre-hid the ducks and ""found"" them on walks or perhaps brought them long to ""hide"" while he walked as a sort of cheerful discovery for whomever may find them. If nothing else that's more likely and the OP just grew up so used to the dadjokes that they never thought about how wild it is that this man finds ducks everywhere.\s\sEither way it's wholesome sweet :DI hide the real baby duck I do get a different response though. As someone who’s latest thing is leaving rubber ducks everywhere I was genuinely curiousmy thoughts exactly.Rubber LakeThere’s one over by Fatal Fields...Did he walk by a rubber duck factory or something? Those things don’t grow on trees I’m glad you took a second picture that’s a close up. I wasn’t able to tell that it was a duck.u/fuckswithducks How do you know that your dad did that could've wandered in there 🤔That’s impossible. Rubber ducks don’t have legs.FI want to be touched by this story but I cannot help but associate rubber duckies with /u/fuckwithducks so this is giving me mixed feelingsOk someone is cutting onions in here. STAHP. They told me today that dad has a tumor on his prostate. I'm so scared.Why am I crying in the club rnI think it’s true. I inherited my grandmom’s handbags and found the MOTHERLODE of those strawberry candies years later in a weird secret pocket.Oooo send those my way! I don't even know where to buy those When my mom passed I sat in her chair after the passing and found a copy of walt whitman's leaves of grass. There was an inscription from her father who passed a few years earlier dated 1976 then one below that written by her to me. She wrote it but never sent it.

Found rubber ducks on walks. Right. Whenever I find arrowheads for sale I buy a bunch and pocket them. Then when I take my youngest fishing when he starts to get bored I drop a few around our fishing  spot. Then I find one and get all excited and tell him how rare they are.

My grandmother passed a few years ago and the year after I got an email from her. \s\sNo explanation I sorta lost it. \s\sTurns out my mom kicked on her computer and pending messages on outlook finally sent.

Granddaddy Anderson liked a sip now and then but my great-grandmother was a teetotaler.  So he'd frequent the local entrepreneurial distiller (dry county) and come home and hide his purchases pretty much anywhere.\s\sAfter he passed the grandkids (my dad's generation) would find Mason jars of moonshine **everywhere**.  When my grandparents passed and we finally started demolishing some of the old farm buildings 15 years ago we found one inside the hollow of a cinder block foundation.  None of us dared taste it as it looked like kerosene.Rubber ducks are the best ducks. I wish everyone would hide ducks :)Is your dad James Veitch?I'm not crying you're crying.

I get it now.Your dad seems like he was a pretty awesome dude you were lucky to have him. Also oddly enough while unpacking boxes today I found a tiny rubber duck. I have no idea how it got into my stuff or where it came from.Oooo! Ducklings!Quack quack!He was Karl king of ducksRight in the feels...Where was he walking that he would find rubber ducks with any kind of regularity? I've been on many walks in my 42 years and have yet to find a rubber duck. It seems like something I should experience. I want to believe but I've never found a rubber duck on a walk.  Maybe I need to find better places?

She had a pretty good plan from the ISP but it was still very slow like slower than it should be even when you account for an ISP's general incompetence. So the ISP sent a technician out to investigate turns out my late father had mangled all of their cable cords before he died back in 1999 so that he could watch sports in his second story office. It was kind of a fun thing to learn about even though I'm sure he didn't *intend* to inconvenience my mother 15 years later.In the club?""Guess where I'm crying rn"" \s\sIn the club?Drake is that you?Bottle full of bubOn a motherfucking boat.I don't know why I'm crying in the club right now In the back seat cup holder?Oh no they're crying on the toilet for sure lol.Ain't no crying in the clubNice.Hey hey let the beat carry\sYour tears as well they fall baby Bitch I'm in da club *50 cent starts playing r/boneappleteaNext to a rubber duck?shiiiit you knowCan someone just link me to the fickswithducks response to this?Very cute!

I recently lost my father this year and have been reminded of him in songs he used to sing and shows we used to watch together.  Even though they make me sad they are amazing memories that I will always have to be able to share with him even though he is gone.  Love this post. Very touching. This is the best use of rubber ducks ever! I think u/fuckswithducks would beg to differno im not crying no""... always found rubber ducks on his walks.""\s\sExcuse me what? I miss my dad now. He died almost 7 years agoThis guy and I are both part of the photography club at Texas a&m. He’s a pretty cool guy :)/r/madlads Hope they kept it thereMy grandpa used to hide $2 bills around the house when he came to visit and we were always scrambling to find them. I probably spent a few here or there as a little kid but most still live in a cigar box with some other treasures. He passed away when I was eleven - I found the “last” taped up in the back of my closet when I was packing for college. r/rubberducksDamn I miss my dad. It was ten years ago this May that he passed. Still read the notes he wrote to me.  He was a walking treasure as far as I'm concerned. It's funny how you don't realize it at the time. This reminds me of that old Mrs. Piggle Wiggle story. She was a widow whose incredibly rich husband die but he stashed his riches in little spots around the house for her. She always living by modest means didn’t have any trouble living off of what she occasionally found but eventually it began to run out. She started to worry. I forget exactly how but some children she had taken in helped her to find the final “treasure”—enough to last her the rest of her life and a letter from her husband.71 is the new 61. 3/4 grandparents madeit to their late 70s mid 80s.Not dead? \s\s:)\s\sayy niceI immediately thought of what would happen if one of them didn't text back a smiley face and the anxiety kicked inHonestly that’s kind of macabre Nah. Death is something you can't opt out of and it'll happen to all of us eventually. I think this is a very realistic but warm-hearted and caring approach to the whole thing; if one or the other won't send that smiley face the other knows to send someone over to check on her. That way no one is left with the guilty thought of ""if only I'd known I could have done something"".All I can think is what’s going to happen one day when one of them doesn’t reply. It’ll be really distressing. Who needs friends to wake you up when the voices in your head do the same thing? My mom is just shy of 80 and her best friend  of 60 years is 86. They talk each morning and ask how they slept and then check their blood pressure to report it to each other. Her friend has a log of their blood pressures so she can notice an trends. Best friend of *60 years*?! That’s really sweetOh wow technology is truly amazingI worked tech support for at&t for just over a year and I distinctly remember helping an older lady who said that she calls her friend every day to make sure she is alright. ""Because at our age it doesn't hurt to be checked up on every once in a while"". I helped fix her service and got them patched in and heard them talk to each other.  It was one of the few times I felt like I had really done something for someone and had an impact on their day.My great grandma would often rhetorically ask after waking up “ohh so I’m still alive?” She’s no more.[removed]But who texted ""...""?SHE and her friend. For the love of all that is holy SHE not her. There are two old ladies in my building that happen to be sisters but don't live together. The building is kind of like a broken horseshoe with a park in the center. One lives on the first floor of one half of the building the other lives on the third or fourth of the other half.\s\sThe one I know walks her dog in the park at the same time every day and makes sure to pause below her sisters place . She'll wait and eventually her sister waves to her from a window she reads next to on the the upper floor once the first one sees the wave she continues on her walk and heads home.\s\sIt's their way of checking in on one another.\s\s\sI was talking to my mom during Christmas.  She's 69 and I'm 38.  We were talking about how I was approaching 40 and she was approaching 70 but both of us don't feel old. In my mind I feel like I'm in my late 20s still and she probably feels like she's in her late 40s.\s\sI don't know I guess I can't imagine my mom being a place where someone would need to text her to see if she woke up.One day her friend didn’t write back.. \s\s\sBut it turned out she wasn’t dead and everything was okay. It was only dementia. One day one of them won’t respond Every time someone asks my grandpa how he's doing he say ""Well I'm here because I woke up at 82 what more can I ask for I doing great"" I call to check in on the wife of my dad's best friend. My dad and his friend are gone now and she doesn't have kids who live close by. She answers the phone. ""Looking at the right side of the sod."" Not sure if she does that for everyone or just me. [deleted]Tell your grandpa I say “whattup” next time you chat with him.this is so my dad's style of response but he uses a very old timey way used in mexican spanish that goes something like\s\s> ""Hey how are you?""\s\s> ""I am which is a profit""\s\sThe literal wording for the reponse is ""Estamos que es ganancia"". The word ""Estamos"" is changed to plural first person which is a way to formalize a conversation (again very old time style). It literally means ""we are"" and is meant as something like ""we exist"". This makes a play on the ""how are you?"" question which in spanish is ""Como estás?"" using the same verb.\s\sAnd the ""profit"" part which is literally translated from ""ganancia"" is meant as something good that happens like ""that's a win in my book"" so a similar response in english would be ""I am here which is a win in my book""My law firm had a client who was in his 70s when we represented him 30+ years ago. I remember this so well:\s\s""How are you today Mr. Smith?""\s\s*""Oh sitting up and able to take a little soup thank you dear!""*\s\sThat was his response every time for years.  Would always wink at me and press my hand to shake it firmly when he said this.   My hand always had a $5.00 bill in it afterward (I was the legal secretary at the time).\s\sHe was in good health at the time and a total rascal.  I imagine he's no longer able to ""take a little soup.""\s\sThank you Mr. Smith those $5.00 bills meant lunch (soup!) for a struggling secretary!About a year ago I made small talk with some real old dude as I was walking down the street downtown I said something about how cold the weather was and he said 'Ahh I'm just glad it's another day that I'm alive'. \s\sI was like damn put it in perspective why don't you. He might be dead by now.My grandma says “well I ain’t six feet under so I reckon I’m doing pretty good.” Gotta love old people and their weird mortality humor. I always say something like ""Well I'm vertical and ventilating so that's a pretty good start.""Stay woke gramps. My grandpa used to say to that ""Aw hell I can't complain--wouldn't do no good anyhow""""Any day above ground is a good day.""Im 30 and ""Well Im still alive so I got that going for me."" is my go to for ""hows it going?""Every day above ground is a good one!I do the same thing with my friends but we call it Snapchat streaks“We not dead girl! :)”Hello!

\sYou could write a novel about this! I’d call it:    “The morning message”makes u think how quick all of this can end I love this so much I wish I could love it more. Maybe I should start doing that not to make sure the other person wakes up but so that I actually get messages from other people.We don't deserve grandmas or friends or smiley faces.My grandpa sends a similar message to us grandkids except it’s the current temperature at around 1 in the morning followed by an “I’m Okay”/r/FunnyAndSad/r/WholesomeAndSadMy grandma opens her blinds in the morning along with her neighbor doing the same. This is actually because they both live alone and they walk their dogs in the morning so if they didn't open the blinds something may have happened and they'll go check. It's a really good idea to do this with a friend or neighbor if you live alone.That's kinda dark actuallyHi NormaniThank you! The familiar face was torturing me.And one day one of them wont answer :(I lost my husband about 16 months ago and my best friend texts me first thing and last thing every day so I don't feel so alone.  She's a frickin wonder.Truly wholesome. I can go about my Christmas season happy as a clam.Oh cool basically seeing who is going to die first :)*gets text*\s“(:”\s... god damn bitch just won’t give up. Unless they have a medical condition 71 isn't even that old to have to do that..If she doesn't wake up she should send a sad faceSmells like dead spirit😁I've been doing that for about a decade with two friends my age; when we started we all lived alone. Two of us are in relationships now but the three of us still text to make sure we are all okay.☺That’s sweet! I hope your friendship lasts forever! 😊Wait so what does the other friend text back if they’re dead?My parents are nearer to 71 than 70 and this post has got me fucked up.Her and her""Yep haven't died today.""These comments make me sad.That sounds kind of dark...[Source](https://twitter.com/finah/status/943207874016165890)I'm friends with a lady who turned 71 last week. We wake and bake at least twice a week. Makes me sad when I think about not having much time left with her. I'm hoping she has another 20 years of smoking left.Why is there a random image of a girl from televisionBlack Twitter. Black reaction pics/gifs is like there thing.""hey are you alive""My grandma did this with her eldest sister. Her sisters kids didn’t check up on her regularly and she did this to know that she was alright and everything’s okay. She did this until the day she passed. I’m happy to know that people also use this system. :)makes me a little teary-eyedAnd my grandma can't even manage to work the cable remote without changing the TV from HDMI1 to PCIs 71 old? I thought that was still considered retirement territory?My Dad is 71.\s\sFor my own peace of mind I define ""old"" as ""older than my Dad."" \s\sSo 71 is while close to old not QUITE old. :P ☺️71...* She and her friend. Not her and her friend. Grandmas and their friends are cute. My grandmother had a blind friend who would call her every weekday to watch soaps together. My grandmother would describe it and they'd have a lovely conversation. My grandmother was 95 when she does and left her friend hanging... It was a cute relationship.jThat’s what my 80 year old neighbor did until she died.She should ask her to send her a happy face every morning as well I'm sure grandma would love knowing that her granddaughter is thinking about her every morning.Also then one morning when she doesn’t get her friends happy face she’ll still at least get one from her granddaughter that's a real commitment though.  old people will do it every. single. day. with each other.  no exceptions because they know that missing a txt means making calls to make sure they're still alive.  you can't have some flaky relative doing it and no one should put themselves in a position where they might disappoint a grandparent by being unreliable.\s\sjust txt'ing them or even better calling them several times a week will be enough to have a grandparent's enormous gratitude.I do this with my mom! It makes her so happy and comforted. My friends from addiction treatment and I text each other good morning every day as well. It's so helpful and loving. What's difficult is when they stop because that means they've relapsed or they have passed. One of my friends died Christmas Eve 2016 and her parents never stopped paying her phone bill. I still text her and leave voicemails. Sometimes I get a response and wonder if it's her mom dad or sister. I never ask.My mother and I have discussed doing this.  She’s a single 65 yr old who doesn’t talk to one of my siblings the other lives out of country.   She works at a different business everyday of the week as a book keeper.  We talk on The weekends.  She’s be ripe before anyone found her. Hey I just saw you talking about $5 milkshakes elsewhere on Reddit. What's up man how you been?Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey sexy lady! aha (rocks)""This post isn't wholesome enough maybe I can use guilt to suggest a way for this post to meet my standards"".😵That’s so cute 😭Both my grandfathers died in their early 70's. Just because some of you think that 71 is not that old doesn't mean that health problems don't exist. Many of us hope to live a long life in to our 80's and 90's but we might not all get the chance.Absolutely my father died earlier this year at 67.This is either really wholesome or your grandma has extreme severe ocd or texting addiction. :( :) :( :) :( :) :( :( :) :)[removed]Don't be sad face because it's over be happy face because it happened!😞\s\sDidn't come here for the feels...Sad face.Don't look at it was sad eventGrandma and her friend lol that’s kinda sadThat's a pretty sweet and practical system.The lack of a ""polo"" in a ""marco polo"" trope would be good for both sad movies and horror movies.My gram is 92. Still straight pimpAnd then there's the day she receives a sad face🙂but of they are asleep how do they send a text?My nana had a friend shed call every morning to make sure the other didnt die as well. She never got into texting.My grandmother did that as well. She called it her ""still vertical club"".I want a friend shed too!You know you’re getting old when you go to less birthday party’s and more funerals It's depressing that the likely outcome of this will likely be one dying due to the added stress on their body from the anxiety of waiting for the smiley face because the other friend overslept because they were up all night doing coke and drinking. [removed]😂 $0.25 /u/tippr71? That ain't that old damn \s\sThen again I do this with my depressed friend who's only 29 :/ I just said the same thing. It's not like 71 year olds are a moments notice from death.You’re a good friend. As somebody suffering through depression I bet that means the world to them. :)My gramps is 79 and still goes to work (heavy machine operator). My grandma is 79 and has planned a kayaking trip for this summer.\sAnd I can't even lift one of my arms above my head. My Grandma died at 70 :/ but no one thought she was near death to be fair :(You are such a great person!At least once a day I text my friend to see how she's going. She's only 20 but she's in a mental health clinic due to a recent suicide attempt.  \s\sI like to think it helps her but it's mostly to reassure me that she's alright.:):)i wish someone sent me a happy face every morning :(😊It's so sad but wholesome at the same time.They are their own Life Alert. Happy face emojis are the key to eternal life this broke my heart 😭I don’t understand the picture. Does that have something to do with this post?It’s going to be horrible when one of them doesn’t get that text once they’ve woken up :( That is still kind of dark...My friend last days I called her daily to make sure she wakes up and hear her voice one last time Some Sheriffs' Offices have volunteer programs you can sign up for to call people every day to make sure they are okay.\s\sThis is an example of one program:\s\shttps://snohomishcountywa.gov/2993/You-Are-Not-AloneIm sad after that one because imagine when one day one of them doesn’t get a smiley face :(Together we are stronger.how cute... until that one day where one is dead.Ffs is 71 *that* old??No. 91 is though.

This is pathetic Depends how you live.My grandma passed away this summer but she and her sister who lives about a mile away  used to call each other every morning to make sure they woke up. They also used to call each other when the Braves were playing to talk about the game and stats and whatnot!🙂Oh man it's gonna be very sad for one of them the morning she doesn't receive the picture from her counterpart :(\s\sAnd for me too I literally just dropped a tear thinking of that situation...😭Grandma and her *FIEND*I worked tech support for at&t for just over a year and I distinctly remember helping an older lady who said that she calls her friend every day to make sure she is alright.

It was one of the few times I felt like I had really done something for someone and had an impact on their day.Will you call to check in on me when it comes to be time?Lol what? You three wayed the friend? How did that go? [deleted]This is the 2017 version of old people who read the obituaries everyday to make sure they don't know anyone in them.That's not just wholesome that's extremely practical for anyone who lives alone regardless of age\s\s/r/LifeProTips My grandma does the same she call her friend by phone everyday with the same question: ""yet alive?"". They both 86.My Grandma used to drive to exercise class with her old peers and one day one of them didn't answer the phone or come to the door. \s\sThey later found out she had a heat attack in her house and laid there for hours before dying. \s\sProbably should have called the police when she didn't answer but part of me thinks it's probably a god send she died instead of living on for however long in a hospital bed before dying anywaysThat's not even that old...My mom is over 70 so are all her friends and they’re nowhere near the point of being concerned about waking up. We don’t know the specific situation surrounding the post above but I just don’t want anyone getting the idea that everyone has this concern at that age. Mom has started having some knee issues but she’s all about water aerobics and her yoga ball class is definitely more active than me (and lets me know it) and being retired is often traveling to visit her grandkids several states away.It isn't necessarily about health. If you live alone and don't have a job meaning there's no one expecting to see you on a regular basis it's a good idea to have someone you check in with. 'Cause stuff happens./r/darkmemes71? Maybe 91... In the last few years of my nan's life her next door neighbour would always pop in and ask if she wanted anything from the supermarket. She always said that she didn't and he knew she'd always say that. He was just checking up on her.Hey that’s a good idea!My gma 87 bless her heart.My dad just passed 3 weeks at 73. The only reason I knew there was a problem is because I called him every morning and he didn't answer or call me back. So yeah it definitely is a good system. Had I not called every day who knows how long it would've been before he was found. RIP Pops.Funny and sadI exchange good morning texts everyday with my 67 year-old mother. I’m 35. It’s quite fulfilling being in touch everyday versus calling because you feel like you should and it’s been awhile since you talked. Imagine the problems if one of them just forgot to do thatThe other would just call and the issue would be solved right away...Who are *you* to make me have all these feels? Bambi's movie scene in which Bambi's mom died? Who are *you*? (This is beautiful)71 isn't really that old.Oh man.  I hope I die before my SO because I hate everyone else and I'll certainly rot for months if she's not around to scoop my body up.  Icky!It doesn't get more wholesome than this.I had an older co-worker at one point who told me she and a friend would use the ""poke"" feature on Facebook to tell each other that they were still alive each morning. 71 isn't old enough to worry about your friend dying on a daily basis.This needs a sequel for when one of them doesn't text back!That's actually pretty morbid\sMy mum has just started doing this but she texts a random emoji every day. The other day it was 🖕 followed by “oh sorry I MUST start wearing my glasses...”Me and my friend do the same thing so if we can call each other and not miss classOne of them is going to have a very interesting morning and I mean that in the most wholesome way possible.Wholesome!? That sounds depressing.71 is a bit young to die in your sleep.Streaks It's a frowny face otherwise.That's perfectly fantastic The moment of regret that make your heart drop. Sorry grand grand :(My grandmother just died this morning. I'm glad to see all this positivity around the older generation. While I was never as close with my grandmother as other people are with theirs I still think I probably could have been more grateful for the time had.\s\sLove all of you this is sub is amazing. Thanks for the wholesomeness :).thats super sad That is both heartwarming and depressing. But mostly heartwarming.My mother started browsing the obituaries in her late 40s to see if anyone she knew had died.I'll say the same thing I said when I saw this last week. Jesus my dad is 72 and I wouldn't even consider this for years with him. I'm skeptical. My grandma 73 and has to call Charter to her apartment to fix the tv because she can't work the remote.Wholesome? That’s downright terrifying. Death is scary.Grandma equivalent of a streak I once listened to two elderly family members talk. One was a close relation and the other was his wife's sister and neither had seen the other in some time. Both were in their seventies.\s\sThey were sitting there catching up and eventually the subject fell to dead spouses since both were widows. The subject that struck me most was the bedsheets conversation.\s\sOne doesn't have to wash the sheets as often when one is a widow. This is a blessing because fitted sheets are a pain and one's hands don't work as well anymore. It's as simple as sleeping on one side of the bed for one week and moving off to the other side of the bed the next. Flip each pillow over once and you'll only have to wash pillowcases once a month.\s\sThey way they spoke about it was so casual but the concept was one of the most mentally crushing things for me hear.\s\sOne day I might only have to wash the sheets every two weeks.\s\sAnd that's one of the most frightening things for me to think about.the day grandma doesn't get a replybut 71 is not old 71 is not that old...Agreed but shit happens. Accidents are a tragic part of lifehowBut smaller things that younger people have an easier time surviving can kill an older person. My grandfather was still cutting down trees with a chainsaw at that age and in great health. And then one day he had a heart attack while up on a tree fell and was in coma for a month. He never properly recovered. Didn‘t die immediately (though he often reminded everyone he would have preferred that) but certainly could have and didn‘t have a quality life until he died a few years later from all the complications. My heart 💚So...  If there's no text they know that either the other person is dead or their phone is?When I was a cashier at my first job my boss was pretty aged. 60s 70s probably. A local friend of his (same age) came in and my manager called out “hey man how’s it going I thought you were dead!” They both thought that was pretty funny. 16 year old me thought it was pretty dark. Her and her friend 71 is old but it ain't old enough to die in your sleep unless your health is bad.This is precious. I lost my 73 y/o grandma in August. She didnt have a husband but a twin sister and a best friend who lived around the corner. If it weren't for friends like her's I dont know if she would've been able to pass away so peacefully. Her twin sister and her friend talk every day now... I do this too except instead of a friend texting me it's an annoying alarm that I can't find a better tune forIts wholesome because everyone will die one day but they dont want to die :') Honestly gotta love this sub. Makes me feel warm in my chest errytime i see a post :) there's a diner i like to go to a few times a week in the late mornings when it's not busy so I can read the newspaper in peace.  and there's a group of older guys who are clearly retired who all hang out and talk about current events I guess not out of real interest but just to have something to do.\s\si envy them a lot.  i wouldn't really want to join them i don't have much in common with them and pretending to be engaged in conversation is exhausting for me.  but sometimes they'll say ""____ is late someone call him"" (b/c they're all too old to see each other as reliable txt'ers you see) and it seems like it's more out of concern making sure they're still alive and kicking moreso than missing the camaraderie.  i then get this weird feeling of sadness that this is necessary for them but also i feel very glad that they have each other as a support group.[deleted]I upvoted your comment and the little CSS ""uplifted"" animation played next to the cursor made me feel kinda weird. I miss my grandparents too.Big hugs hun. This could also be a little morbid.\s\sGrandma and her friend text each either a happy face each morning to make sure their best friend is still alive. I hope they are texting those happy faces for a long long time!I've tracked you down you complete fool! I come with from the future with grim news so that you may change our dreadful lives. You unknowingly caused the death of thousands with your wish. It came true. It bloody fucking cuntily came true. We are plagued by two ancient vampires. They suck the blood of the strong they reap the infant from the hard clutches of the mother. With this knowledge... Please take back your wish.That's probably the joke that's going over these young peoples heads. 71 isn't old enough to be worried about dropping dead every night. It sounds more like a combination of old people loneliness and old people morbid humor.That's so adorableMy grandmother died at 71 and I had to call all of her friends to inform them as my mom was too distraught.  It’s one of the most heartbreaking things to do in life calling person after person being subject to their reaction their cries their words.  Same here only it was my mother who died at age 69 and I was the one who called all of her friends and family to make the notifications so that my father wouldn’t have to.  It was really hard to do but I think it would have absolutely wrecked him. Just thinking about that duty made me tear up (at work)What a blessing for your mother to have a steely person in her life she could count on to make those calls. That’s something to be proud of. \s\sEdit: steely isn’t the right word but hopefully you get what I’m trying to say. i cri evrytiemThese grandmas have come up with one of the most heartwarming ways to use of technology to help in their daily lives. I hope they both have a long and happy life.Wife and I did this when one of us was traveling for work and our youngest was still in a crib. I had to make sure if I died in my sleep the baby wouldn't starve to death the next few days. Dunno if wholesome or super morbid.There's gonna be some panic when one of their phone stops working One time I was walking on the beach and saw two big black labs playing fetch with their owner. The owner threw the ball and the dogs started after it but then they made eye contact with me.\s\sY'all the dogs *turned away from the ball* to romp over and say hi to me. They were so sweet and I knelt down and basically was smothered by dog.\s\sI rode that high for *weeks.*It's the same feeling when I find that extra onion ring in my bag of fries. Love those people who do that. [""One time I was walking on the beach and saw two big black labs playing fetch with their owner""](https://i.imgur.com/drLKAFm.jpg)\sI want a dog now :(I'm scared sh*t of dogs so two dogs running toward me would raise my heart rate rapidly and probably cause a heart attack.I can see you selected the Animal Friend perk.\sr/outsideMy parents old neighbors had a sweet yellow lab named Sadie who would sneak over to hang out with my mom while she was gardening. Her family would let her out to go to the bathroom she'd do her thing then go running to my mom to get some pets and tummy rubs then go running back to her house.\s\sShe'd do the same to me when I was out walking my parents' dog. The two didn't care much about each other Sadie came over to say hi to me.Whenever a dog runs up to me to ""say hi"" they seem to say hi by sniffing my crotch :( As a woman it doesn't make me feel great. Naw they just love smelling all the things!""Look he's smiling and bearing his teeth at me!""Very true. That's why I carry a little bit of food on me whenever I go to places like parks or beaches. Could be sausage bacon oatmeal cookie or anything small and fragrant. Sneaky but I love itThis. Exactly this.[deleted]Baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more.Not often you s ee x-posts from /r/meirl on /r/wholesomememes. Because you smell canine.Yes I always assume there must be something about me that smells weird. I mean they would probably also pull on their leash to go and smell a dog turd so it doesn't feel like much of compliment that they want to smell me too.My dog does this alot.Literally happened yesterday:\s\sOn a new walk route through our neighborhood that took me onto an odd u-shaped street of upscale houses when I see a full grown cat wearing a collar bound down the walkway of a house running at a good trot right at me for pets.  Flopped down and rolled over for scratches and rubs.  Happy as hell to see me and totally chill with belly scratches. \s\sI've always been an 'animal oriented' person who greets and read dogs/cats well but that was a first.  I've had needy strays run up to me and then follow me down the street for a bit in the past but never a well fed house cat who was that unabashedly enthusiastic for the encounter and chill when I left.Fake news. No cat ever liked belly scratches. ^^^^/s ^^^^of ^^^^course. yes!!This one time i was on a hike and a dog ran up to me out of no where dropped a stick at my feet. Licked my hand and ran off.  I now use that stick whenever i go for a hikeThere is writing prompt somewhere in there...Legends say the poor dog is still waiting for the stick to be thrown so he can fetch itIt's the Canadian way you get magic wandsThe prophecy lives on continue forth legendary stick wielder *licks hand*\s\syou're welcome bro no need to thank meNo throw. Only take.They say the good boy is still running to this day...Now I know where my trekking stick is. Once on a trek I got a wooden trekking stick for €20. Half way down the way a dog chased me and forced me to throw my stick. Being scared of dogs I gave up my stick. He took it and ran away; while the owner said he'll keep the stick somewhere on the route. Needless to say I came home without my trekking stick. My dog has a crush on a guy who works at a restaurant down the street. She stops and insists on saying hello and giving him kisses. If we're across the street she makes me cross over to go see him. One day just as we were leaving the house he happened to be walking past and she reacted like the dog who sees her military veteran owner returning from the war leaping and whining and wagging her tail and licking his face.\s\sI think he's a little lonely; he's from another country on the other side of the world and I'm not sure what his family situation is. I get the impression that my dog gives him some affection and love in his life that he may be missing. I wonder if my dog senses it and maybe that's why she's so lovey towards him. Omgoodness everything about this story warms my heart.This sounds like the beginning of a rom-com.She doesn't have a crush she's trying to be a wingdog.That just makes me feel extra meaty. Happened with me as well! But the dogs way of greeting me made me get injections. ...insulin 'cause of all that sweetness?Oops.use protection guysOr bark at me You know who rules? Dogs. That's who.What if the dog is trying to bite you? a rottweiler booped me with his snoot while i was jogging\s\sgot his slobber all over my arm\s\sthat day was a good dayI love when big dogs jump up and put their paws on my hips bc it's almost like they're trying to hug me. My dog does that. She always requires a hug when someone gets home.You must be tall. :) My dog does that and her paws always land square on my chest even though I'm average height and she's just on the larger end of being a medium sized dog.When my dog jumped up to greet me after not seeing me for a while I would always go all in and give her a big hug. Sometimes I still fantasize about that (not in a weird way I just miss it) because it was so niceMy dog tries to do that but ends up punching guys in the nuts with her paws. It's so embarrassing! And then the owner allows him to fill my heart with puppy kisses and doggo love Except for when I'm on the other side of a crossing. Once a friendly dog wanted to say hi but there was a busy road in the way fortunately the owner stayed vigilant and kept a tight grip on the leash.Yesterday I had a dog come and say hi of his own volition and I felt so validated yessssI want oneMy dog does this with everyone! Too bad some people are terrified of dogs. It can be difficult to know if I should let her go toward someone or not.Hi I'm someone who's not a big fan of dogs. I think you should let the person come towards you and your dog instead of letting your dog go towards them unless the person makes a very obvious sign.I have to fight the urge to pet people's dogs. Similarly I feel great when my cat snuggles with me. Animal affection is so nice. My dog will spend all day cuddled under my desk or plopped down next to me ready for pets. It's the best feeling to come home to a creature so unashamedly ecstatic that you're there.My favorite is when my dog licks my face/hand when I feed him. This is more /r/meirl/I tell this story a lot and I doubt people enjoy it nearly as much as I do but one time me and my friends were tripping by a river and this woman walks by walking her dog.  I look at one of my friends and say ""man i wish that dog would come say hi"" and totally forget about it because we had just started coming up.  We are still there like 20 minutes later when she walks back and the dog pulls her over to us.  I shit you not she goes ""he just wanted to say hi"".  I don't think i have ever felt as close to an animal as I did in that moment.   >doubt people enjoy it nearly as much as I do\s\sWell it gave me a big ear-to-ear smile. : )\s\sIt also reminds me of the time I encountered someone walking her dog across the street and when they got near me he started wildly wagging his tail. So I asked the lady if I could pet him. She said ""Yes but he's a jumper!"" The more she tried to calm him the more excited he got.\s\sWhen I finally patted his head he jumped on me and I hugged him. And no exaggeration - the dog *put his arms around my neck*! He hugged me back as I knelt down and I couldn't stop laughing. He didn't let go for as long as we were in that hug.\s\sThe lady took me by surprise and sounded choked up when she said ""Oh thank you. Thank you! You don't know what that means to him...""\s\sThing is I was having a troubled day... so in the end it was really that no one knew what the dog's hug had meant to me. For the rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about how an unknown animal showed me such affection without restraint - and that was all I'd needed.2.6 likes and 10 comments??

I may even kiss you nose.\s\sI FUCKING LOVE DOGS\sI need you not to get you validation from a dog.WhyUmm can dogs distinguish beauty in humans? I think it's more plausible that they were reacting to something else entirely...I saw my dog a golden toy poodle pulling towards a socially awkward looking guy the other day. I'm quite well built short haired guy and he didn't want to make eye contact with me. He stood aside as I approached and my dog was whining and standing up on his legs to get a stroke.  I obviously let him and you could just see the guy instantly relax. He petted my dog who loved it then he looked up at me. I gave him a smile nodded and said thanks you made his day. The look on his face was priceless. He walked off with his head up smiling. My dog is awesome. Your username makes me believe you are skipping somethingYour dog has a sweet heart! My dog loves to be pet by strangers but he's 90 lbs and gets so excited he usually jumps on them so I rarely let him anymore. :( plus he has a gentle lead so he can't drag me around and I think a lot of people think it's a muzzle.  [Ainsley you're enough to make a good dog break his leash](https://youtu.be/-Bbz5q2dxRU) I think it's a little bit sad that that's when OP feels most beautiful. Has OP been beautiful to a human? I agree it's a nice feeling though.This post warms my heart :)Always thought it was because it wants to fucking kill me. Good to know I may be wrong about that\sDoggos are the best basically breathing walking wholesomenessThese dogs are frustrated greeters and probably react this way toward everyone or at least 90% of people LOL.\s\sWhenever I see these dogs straining toward me on their leash I remind myself their neck hurts their owner is most likely annoyed at this behavior and I'm the hundredth person that day this dog has tried to pull up to.\s\sAnd then I ignore the dog so I don't encourage the behavior of dragging the owner down the street.So how could one train their dog to pull on his leash towards all the pretty ladies walking on the sidewalks?If I were you I'd give it a signal to chase.Get a dog that has more interest than others than you.\s\sAnd instead of correcting the dog for pulling allow the pretty lady to pet the dog.\s\sHe'll continue pulling and the behavior will get more intense and then you'll have a dog that helps you pick up girls.One of my neighbors in my complex has the cutest puppy I've ever seen. One day I was walking by and he sprinted out the door straight at me and I was petting him and scratching his head for like 30 seconds before I realized that my neighbor was standing in the door frustratedly trying to call him back. He didn't go back until I said ""alright puppy go back to your dad!"" and he went happily running back right away. That puppy liked me. It was the best. He wants to sniff yo butt \sThats how you know youre hotThis is a great feeling I have only had it a few times and it was with cats hope that doesn't ""mark me"".  However it was ...wonderful... cat meowing loudly from the side yard of a house and intercepting me out by the street.  Like an old friend saying hello from a forgotten past life. \sAfter I finally put her down she kept meowing and walking deliberately in front of my feet tripping me up so I could hardly leave. \sSuch an unexpected sweet kindness...a pure love that has moved me for years since.  She must be into bestiality. Villentretenmerth is the most beautiful When I feel the most betrayed is when a dog doesn't want to say hi to me the coolest thing a dog has ever done was this one time the fire alarms went off in my unit.\s\s\sI'm standing outside in the dark with a bunch of other people and this corgi mix trailing a leash comes sprinting down the stairs obviously having been scared by the noise and pulled loose from his humans. He ran straight to me (someone he had never met) turned around and sat his butt down on my feet. He kept watch over my toes growling slightly at the beeping building until his owners caught up.\s\s\sLittle dude didn't even know me but he wanted to protect my toes from the scary noises. Anyway that's the story of why corgis are my favorite dog nowIt's also pretty cool when babies stare at me and smile a lot and giggle when they see my unusual hair color. Hello!

\s[](/spikedog ""Saw your name and thought I was on front there for a solid minute!"") I find it interesting that the owner usually apologizes for this though.I was at a home improvement store the other day and this woman came in with her dog and the dog and I made eye contact for like a second. He immediately stopped and sat down right in front of me and didn't budge until the woman dragged him away by his leash. I was so touched and it made my entire day.As someone who is kinda afraid of dogs when they do this I just assume they want to kill me.That's why I don't teach my dog not to jump on people! JK it's because dog training takes time and dedication (and my dog is moderately well mannered) This is the same way small children/toddlers work. Mine never fails to get a smile when she sings out ""hiiiiiiiiii"" then ""bbyyyyyyeeeee"" when we pass people out for a walk. Yes! I remember being little and curious about the people I saw and how it always made me feel special if they acknowledged me. So now I try to smile and wave if I catch a kid staring at me. Sometimes it has become full-on peekaboo in the checkout lane.God help me I almost started crying in my Uber. I felt that right in the throat. That account is basically cheating on this sub. All of their posts are adorable. Oh my heartwe do buddy we do)))One of my dog does this thing where she puts her head down and presses against my sternum. She presses so hard her back curls up and her breathing changes cause she's pressing her face so hard into my chest and her own neck. When she gets to that point where it almost sounds like she's snoring it makes me smile. It's like she's trying to physically be as close as possible. I take it as her version of a hug :) And I'm crying <3r/2meirl4meirlI saw that tweet earlier today and it made me actually melt so hard. I love the account 😭Hello!

And then I kiss your noggin to let you know I know t e l e p a t h y b o y eTelepapupWould have worked better with telepathicI wish dogs could love. I hope my dogs love me and my wife. I doubt it though. \s\sI have known people who abandon their dogs. The dogs move onto new owners rather flawlessly. \s\sWouldn’t work with humans unless we get them very young. I lived with my dad for a couple years. Spent most of my time there hanging out with his dog. I moved out and didn’t visit for over a year. When I went back to stay and his dog saw me he was literally crying for joy for about an hour and a half. I don’t know if that can scientifically be called “love” but it’s definitely close enough for me.Welp. Now I feel the sudden urge to hug my dog and never let go. i do this with my cat  and my cat is thinking:  feed me MFerMine bites my foreheadMy childhood dog did this to my head as she was getting her injection to be put down. We stayed like that until she passed.

Hopefully with a little more financial security I’ll move to a pet-friendly apartment.I’m glad that you recognize the financial responsibility when it comes to adopting pets! So many people who can’t afford pets adopt them anyways and can’t afford proper medical treatment food toys or other supplies to keep the pet happy and healthy. It's very responsible of you to put yourself in a good position before adopting a pet.  A dog will love you no matter what but having everything ready and stable is best for both of you.  And helps avoid the worst case scenario where you can't afford the dog.  :(I believe my lab is really saying.......feed me....feed meDoes anyone else find it weird when people roleplay as dogs on social media like this?

Vet said he might not make it past Christmas 2 years back but he kept on trucking. Even up until late last night he was up to his usual shenanigans barking and patrolling and wiggling when I walked in from work. \s\sHe was a sucker for attention and my buddies and I could overload him with pets and he’d flip onto back and kick at us and relish every single moment of it. In his prime we would play “no take only throw” at the park for ages. \s\sHe was a part of the last 60% of my life and it hardly feels like home without him. I’ll miss him forever.

Pure unadulterated wholesomeness 💕My cat does this and I’m concerned he’s trying to absorb information that he can use to dominate humanity.That’s how we say goodbye everyday. 💚Rest in paws: Air BudShhh my feeble heart can't take itFuck this is cringey. My heart. How did Dog Feelings get verified?feelsdoggomanAll hail good doggoDear God you weirdos need to get laid...by humans BTW. Not dogs.Lmfao facts! Nearly every comment is fucking cringey man. It's crazy that I thought I was the only one to do this...My heart tho. I don't know why but it reminds me of the movie called ""Hatchi"".I really don't like this putting-words-in-their-mouth anthropomorphising that people do with their pets. It's not healthy. And frankly it's more than a little creepy to see happen in front of you.\s\sThe people that do it tend to believe what their pet says even when it's themselves that said it! It's some weird psychological denial state they're living in.\s\sI'm sure your dog loves you but don't put words in its mouth. It can't speak.[deleted]You should get off the internet now. You won't like the rest of it i'm afraid. It's mostly anthropomorphizing of petsNow I’m ugly crying in the Taco Bell lobby. Atleast you are getting Taco Bell!When I get home from a long midshift work My dog runs scratching at the door I grab my dog hug her tight then pat her head.\s\sMy daily routine of stress -> stress relieved. I need to find myself another goodboy. It's been to long sometimes my doggo rests his head against me and i think hard about how much i love himGood little doggo !!

Have some gold for your kindness!Ain't that the truth especially today with the loss of Carrie FisherI smiled and then I got angry because /r/wholesomememes is not visible when just browsing the frontage but then I smiled again because I have added it to my personal frontage with RES. And I just beat a redditor three times in chess. At this moment I feel ... slightly better then 5 minutes ago. Totally not euphoric that would be pretty weird at 5 am at night browsing reddit. So many nice people here you good sirs just got another sub I wanna meet that dadI was trying to get to sleep last night thinking about my ex not being able to sleep and I checked the time and it was 3 am. I looked at my phone and decided checking reddit was better than wallowing. I opened it and the first thing I saw was a post from this sub. I went to the sub proper and just scrolled through. Then I started smiling and laughing and laid back down and slept like a baby. This sub is a treasure and I thank God for its existence (: I always turn to this sub too now when I'm feeling down which is great because it's not been all that nice of a Christmas! Thank God for your existence too keep it up! This is the best sub ever. [deleted]WE'RE HITTING WHOLESOMENESS LEVELS THAT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE POSSIBLEWhy can't more subs be like this? We need more positivity. - in your name I comment Amen.Why can't I wholesome more of these wholesome memes?! Could someone plz tell me the origin of this meme guyi see him everywhere At the dawn of Memes Harold looked upon his creation and said to Courage Wolf ""Behold it is good.""He's just some model who appeared in a bunch of stock photos. 4chan users named him Harold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHVJD7k1km8I think [this]( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/KjtbV) is the original harold meme.This made my day (or what's left of it)! Makes it worth to still think Reddit is fun. Was puzzled about how ppl on other subs get way too serious and butt hurt because you made an unserious comment. It usually goes from 0 to -9999Probably more than five since only a fraction of viewers have accounts and even less take the time to upvote.4 people. The first point is from you. But even then you could also have some downvotes in there and the actual upvote score for submissions can be muxxed soHey it takes all kinds of people to make up this crazy wonderful world!Went and upvoted every comment below 5\sHappy holidaysYou're a goodie.Since finding this sub I've been actively unsubscribing to negative subs around reddit.  Its kinda amazing what an affect that has on my mood and day.I noticed the cheap thrill of r/PublicFreakout started to turn bitter after a while. I started thinking more about the take down techniques I might need to use in the order line at McDonalds and less time thinking of how I could make my day or the days of others better. (Also spent a lot of time arguing with racists). \s\sr/wholesomememes makes me feel the world is a safe place... My favorite part about the new reddit  algorithm is that this sub is being promoted a lot more. I love this subEven if you only affect one other positively you're doing it right. \s\sGood job (not-so)theevilnerd42.Thanks for this.  :)Make it 5775!!!Aw nice.Easy for you to say when this is on the front page later today Mr. Positive-Effect-On-Tens-Of-Thousands Guy...but if it happens you'll be there too![deleted]Good job getting the highest rated post in this sub I still love you""Aw we're sorry you got 5 points on your post. Here have 73000!"" -r/wholesomememesHave some love friends. :)I like to think that for every upvote you get there's probably like a 100 people who saw your post liked it but just didn't upvote.Okay this was  cuteHappy to add an upvote to you !! Happy to add one to you to :) Everytime I refresh the upvotes on the post go up:)Sigh I had a shot at a good post here but mods shot me down. Said it wasn't a meme. Eve asked them how do I tell but never got an answer. :(http://picturelements.github.io/wholesomesurveyWow what a wholesome meme.Username doesnt check outOnce when I was bored I PMed some lighthearted jokes to random people. I got a lot messages back asking why I messaged them but there was a few people that thanked me and said they really needed a laugh. Moral of the story you never know what will make someone's day.great :)This is the best subHugs!You've improved the lives of 30000 strangers boyo :)We've improved the lives of 30000+ strangers without people like you upvoting less people would've seen it! :) Will these ~45k upvotes be evenly distributed among them?Even distribution of wealth is a great idea Comrade!That's exactly why I'm subbed here. Thanks for spreading positivity!Best new Subreddit 2016To be honest if a post has 5 upvotes on it then it would be 4 people that enjoyed it.  Selfpost are automatically upvoted by the uploader.  But wholesomememes is always a good read!This is now at the top of the all time posts on this sub. I love you people.This post made my day :)I like this subThis sub is the Mr. Rogers of reddit.Upvoted because this meme contributed to improving my day.  Suddenly I feel the need to go on an upvote spree. I won't be forgotten for I am on the archives Monty is that youGood way of looking at it :)Well this post got slightly more than 5 up votes. Your a good dude.You're a great dude Aaaand subbed.Caffeine brings me happiness When you realize you gained thousands of points and improved thousands more lives.Sort by: controversial... Wait what? Also I feel gooder now by much feelsUnless one of those strangers is yourself I'm not so sure about the 5 strangers thingNice job having the top post all time for /r/wholesomememes!who knows maybe it was 7 people's lives you improved but you also pissed off 2 other people!scores online dont matter post what you think: not what you think will score well.  that's probably the biggest advantage of anonymous posting.  no need to filter yourself.  (within reason threats and doxxing are obviously bad)\s\ssave that type of thinking for school assignments that get graded.  THAT is when you change what you say to score better.  if you had a feminist prof for example you'd write about why the patriarchy is terrible.  but online you know the idea of ""patriarchy"" is bullshit.\s\ssee the difference?  this is why online communication is better btw.  more honesty.You just slightly improved the lives of 47678 people. Congratulations. I think we've peaked with this y'all. JFC I will never reddit the same againif i get 5 downvotes does that mean i made 5 peoples day worse? :(Possibly :( i got -120 on a comment yesterday so i made 120 peoples days worse :(Nope if you make a bad comment you can learn from it and make better ones! Just keep trying your best Thank you >l o l*upvote*Does nobody notice the LOL in the background?!This sub really is beautiful! You're beautiful friend! :) Me too thanks.What's this r/wholesomemes all about is it related to r/wholesomememes in some way?That guy looks creepy AF[deleted]What's this you've said to me my good friend? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution and I've been involved in numerous friendly discussions and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it friend. I can be anywhere anytime for you and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't you didn't and now we get to start a new friendship you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living friend.﻿  [](/flutteryay)\s\sEdit: Obligitory ""Thanks for the gold wholesome stranger!!""\s\sEdit2: Aww you guys are so wholesome <3 If I may Im a musician by trade (I compose orchestral arias) -- and specialize in wholesome music :) If you'd like to treat yourself to some pretty stuff please feel free to look up [**Midnight Lament**](https://youtu.be/ubOM_gDCLPQ?t=17s) which is a song about letting go of your past mistakes and forgiving yourself <3Hell I shitpost to specifically make people's days.

But now I'm going to subscribe.  Thanks wholesomememes!> /r/wholesomemesIt may be even more since downvotes lower the points.The only difference is that I always get 0 votes :(But one of them is the up vote your post starts with...I had a really rough week so far so thanks for this man - have an upvote.

What a positive way to look at things :):-) i literally have to look at this meme every time i make a postLet's also not forget that 5 upvotes doesn't mean you made 5 stranger's day because A LOT of people don't upvote so actually you probably made way more people's day than just 5.Is sub is like the reddit version of getting a breath of fresh air. I know it gets said here very often but I really appreciate this sub and everyone here. It's such a nice change from most of the negativity on Reddit.This has to be subreddit of the year.

That sounds pretty cool man Hey OP I just want to let you know that your message has reached more than 5 people.

Trust me without this subreddit I would be dead today. You better stay alive otherwise I'm gonna be angry It was probably just some sympathy upvotesI feel like Harold is secretly one of the mods in this sub.His awkward too-intense stare watches over us all.Who's Harold?\sEdit: I'm dumb. I'm sure it's the guy in the meme.He said in an interview that the reason his smile looks forced is because it is forced. He said he had to keep smiling for hours on end for his work. He just needs his Cinco Dentures and je can be a real Tan Man.This is the best subI know right? I wish I knew about this sub a year ago. Just going through the posts makes me sob about how nice you people are. You don't know me but I love you guys.It's a wonderful replacement for all of the political subs I've filtered from the front page.I love this sub one of my new favorite subs.

\sA very large percentage of viewers are lurkers and people don't necessarily up-vote everything they like or everything that helps them.\s\sKnowing that should make you feel even better than a mere 5 upvotes worth.I've been going through a really rough patch lately and this sub has really helped. Love you guys!Love you too man <3 EXTRA EXTRA Wholesome memes take over reddit everyone nice to each otherI don't get any acknowledgement on most of my posts.It's ok you're doing great! I'm going to look for your posts and try to show you that I appreciate your time and effort because I do. And a lot of times I'm too lazy to even hit upvote and I'm going to make a conscious effort to leave comments and upvote posts in general because you said this so you just motivated me and gave me a new attitude about supporting posts that may have gotten overlooked. Have a good day and don't stop posting! This legit made me smile   :)Now you've made me smile :) /r/me_irl[deleted]You're super awesome man!Thank you very much dear!This happened to me yesterday.Keep trying man <3Damn it wholesomememes I can't have one good miserable day with you around! I like this sub.  Never thought I would like deliberately cheerful stuff but I do.Man do I love this sub. Such a nice escape from the cynicism and hatred and depression that pops up on other subs.Wanted to upvote but post has 5 upvotes which I find symbolic.\s\sOP great jobI am so HAPPY that this sub has gotten so popular in the last month. It's actually making me very happy. Bless this Sub. Whenever you get an upvote imagine it as a real person in the room with you giving you a thumbs up and a smile. Five people doing that is no small thing! Whenever I get 30 upvotes I'm like ""Damn that's like a whole room full of people giving me a smile!""Right now I'm getting stadiums of people giving me a thumbs up :) That's a great thought man! Nice sub but creepy smile lmaoAw yeah man. This is what I think when I post something. I don't look for karma just look to maybe give a few people a quick laugh or something cool. If it has 5 upvotes... Doesn't that mean you helped 4 strangers? Since one upvote is always the poster? Sorry to slightly devalue this wholesome memeI think the assumption is that the post has 6 karma meaning it received 5 upvotes Sometimes you're a stranger to yourself so 5 strangers can be technically correct I think.it might have been downvoted once :-) This is why you downvote your own post. To really help it take offAnyone else read this in GradeAUnderA's voice?You are a true hero OP I will support you so that you will reach and help even more people!Not everyone upvotes there are always lurkers who enjoy your content but haven't made an account yet to upvote :)Seems like you improved the life of 39000 people who could have been facing a rough time! Man this sub is awesome.I just made a post that currently has 4 upvotes\s\s\sThank you Keep it up man if you make a bad post just remember to learn from it and improve with the next one! That way you can hopefully improve more people's days!This is so bad it's good!Went to upvote this and realized my boyfriend already upvoted it 😍I stumbled upon this sub after seeing so much negativity elsewhere and it has honestly warmed my soul and given me hope where it was slowly being drained. I love this place. It makes me smile. :)Isn't it great? I love this sub. This made me feel really good :) Thank youGlad I could help! :) [deleted]Rubberbandits!  \>slightly improved\s\swhat did they mean by this?Whats that guy called?And since 1 of those points is automatically from yourself since reddit starts you at 1 upvote it sure is nice to know that you are improving your own life! Can't forget to care for yourself too!And that 5th person is yourself!We are all strangers to ourselves in some ways 😊Make it 6 OPSubscribed to /r/wholesomememes as a result of this post very refreshing subreddit.Upvoted for ""refreshing""!  I feel the exact same way when I read this sub.I think this sub is the happiest place on reddit. Always improves my day. \spls rember that wen u feel scare or frigten\snever forget ttimes wen u feeled happy\s\swen day is dark alway rember happy dayWhat if they're pity up votes? This subreddit rocks! -sniff- I love you[removed]\sHey /u/theevilnerd42\s\s\sThis is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.This subreddit is so ridiculous... I love you bastardsWe love you too bastard! \s\s(am I doing this right)You are such a great example. It is important to love everyone even if the legitimacy of their heraldry is questionable.well hello harold it's nice to see you on my front pageAs a Canadian I always related to the Flanders flock more than the Simpsons. Ok was it just me or was anyone else expecting to get trolled at ""turned every cheek on his body"" with the ""nothing at all!"" ned Flanders in a speedoFinally somebody cares about Walter White.I remember this episode it was really heartwarming to see him stick up for Ned like that when the entire congregation was trying to ostracize Ned.What Homer said here is totally true. I can't see how anyone can hate Ned. I can see characters getting annoyed but no hate. \s\sI remember choking up a bit in the episode where he opens the Leftorium and it gets close to closing down. There is a part where Homer sees how bad Ned is doing starts to feel bad then makes calls to people to get them to come to the store. When he calls one guy you see the guy laying on the couch napping when his wife tells him that Homer is on phone. He tells her to say that he's not there. But when she says it's about Ned Flanders the guy jumps up to his feet and loudly says ""Ned Flanders is in trouble?!"". \s\sWhat gets me is how fast he gets up. It makes me realize that Ned is the type of guy that most anyone would go out of there way to help. Because you know if the shoe was on the other foot he would be first in line with everything he could give.How could anyone forget? I know the first 13 seasons like the back of my hand.""He turned every cheek on his body"" could be a bit from a Lennon lyric. AmenThat is an incredibly nice thing to say to someone. Wow.Right in the FeelsIt’s so cute until you imagine it in the Homer Simpson voice[removed]Let's sacrifice him to our god!❤❤❤Man I’ve never really watched the simpsons but the little clips of wholesomeness are awesome.I have no words for this I just look at it and I’m just like: WowI always enjoyed Homers short bursts of wisdom and kindness.Homer dropping the realized eschatology.> no words\s\sWowMore [wow](https://youtu.be/hYb41Fs60p8) for those who wanna watch it too[Here is a like to the scene](https://youtu.be/btM9BSHaCz8)\s\s[source](https://youtu.be/btM9BSHaCz8)Shut up FlandersI straight up cried when I heard this even as a preteen. Probably the nicest compliment a person can give. Those feels about a fictional character.this is why I love the old Simpson's especially homer https://youtu.be/39cqQ38Ozts?t=103Especially?For context Ned had gotten angry at Homer for breathing so loudly through his nose during prayer prompting him to yell at Homer to “breathe through your damn mouth.” Everyone in the chapel began to insult him causing Homer to defend him. god I miss when the Simpsons had genuine moments like this frequently\s\sno shame I've cried during a few of the older episodes\s\sLisa's Substitute and the episode about Maggie's birth come to mind All the upvotes :’-)Idk why I’m crying in the club rnFeelserinos**sniff**diddlyDamn. That’s powerful.\sAwwwww \<3Some of the early Ned shows are the best. I like the tornado episode oneThese moments were really what made The Simpsons a great showr/simpsonsdiditThis is why I can watch episodes of The Simpsons up until about season 9 quite happily. Homer was still a decent guy. Stupid but never malicious.  Really wish they just canned the show after ten seasons.[deleted]> works hard\s\slol...Why does this make me so incredibly sad!? \sIt shouldn't it makes no sense.Trump! This is the Simpsons I grew up with.can I get a tl;dr?Homer befriends Flanders but gets a by too clingy so Ned gets annoyed with homers annoying habits and finally snaps when in church and homer is breathing loudly through his nose and yells at him and the church congregation turns on Ned but homer defends him because Neds a good guy 1990s simpsons was great - homer was a great american dad everyman and springfield was a microcosm of middle america\s\sned was the odd evangelical and you had characters like apu who was the foreigner nobody quite understood worshiping multi armed elephant gods - and then you had ""normal"" americans like barney who would be homers friend\s\sthe show in the 2000s became absurd and about nothing tho but thats when futurama came out - simpsons should have ended then and futurama after a few seasons should have eventually been replaced by another matt groening showYeah. I preferred the show in its earlier days back when Homer was just a loving family man who did what was right. Then they made him stupider and stupider until I lost interest they had turned a genuinely funny and kind character into a dummy for sweet sweet views*heart meltsMy heart\sIT'S TOO WHOLESOME\sI THINK I'M GOING TO EXPLODE OF JOY\sAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHomer is wokeLol every cheekBe like Ned Flanders. Flaaaaaaaanderrrs\s\sFlaaaaaaaanderrrrrrrsChoked me up.  Damn that's nice.Touching scene but I got misty-eyed just now because this is from back when Maude was alive...""He's a wonderful kind caring man... Maybe even more so than me.""One reason why I kind of resent Flander's slide into more heartless and prickly fundamentalist territory. He was never that much of a caricature; part of the joke earlier on was that Flanders was thoroughly *normal* and well-adjusted and Homer (with his dysfunctional family and vices) resented that. Flanders was always religious but only in the sense that he represented some sort of idealized Americana sort of character. Now they've made him full-on Christian Right.I ALMOST FREAKING CRIEDAck! Right in the feels!Stupid Flandersi guess we should all be like Ned thenI'm having a hard time imagining everyone being as accepting like flanders and as understanding like homer but i think deep down if we all tried to take those words to heart and applied them every now and then in our lives with our family friends and people around us it certainly creates a ripple effect in others...like touching a still puddle of water and creating those waves! Damn thanks for sharing this OP!We all need to have a little more Flanders and Homer in our hearts.Amen brother 😩🙏What a beautifully written thing to exist Who else read this with Homer’s voice?[The following Thursday 8:00 PM](https://i.imgur.com/7A23S3X.png)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lskLRVnt_cUHomer Simpson might be the dumbest and funniest cartoon father who marked my childhood forever but he's one of the wisest character I know. For example I'll always remember this episode where he returns to the nuclear power station and hide some letters with Maggie's photos : ""Do it for her""Well the original point of the Simpsons was was that no matter how dysfunctional you all are you're still a family at the end of the day (episode)Other important and funny and silly cartoon father figures is Uncle Iroh from Avatar: the last Airbender.\s\sI learned a lot from him.It's moments like this that the new episodes of the Simpsons are missing.The poster he made is [here](https://imgur.com/a/dlxxtdv) and a convenient way to make your [own](https://imgur.com/a/iqjUAYU).The ending to “Mother Simpson” always gets me. [At least this time I'm awake for your goodbye.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAQGpiaSDw)God that episode always makes me cry\s\sEdit: Just watched it again cried.The thing that makes that episode for me is the reveal. They set it up with the kids asking why there are no pictures of Maggie in the house and he responds with a story of how he had to give up his dream and go back to work at the plant because Marge was pregnant with her. But the story ends with him saying how when she was born and grabbed his finger he was hers. And the kids are confused about why this means there are no pictures of her. Cue ""I keep them where I need them most."" Followed by that shot. \s\sI'm crying just thinking about it. Dude works hard enough to support 3 kids and a house wife in a comfortable part of town in a two story house that has two living rooms. Homer is a champ Korosensei is probably the best when it comes to this. He's the adult I never had to guide me.I wish I had no kids and three money.Remember you do it for him\s\sAnd you would do it again\s\sYou do it for her\s\sThat is to say\s\sYou'll do it for him\s\s_________________\s\sI actually didn't give it much thought but after recent revelations in Steven Universe those lyrics just carry an entirely new level of subtext omg.*Worst day of your life so far*“Hey Vicky you’re so so icky. Just the thought of being around you makes me so so sicky” except the whole point of this scene is just to make Ned feel like a piece of shit for hating Homer\s\sthen Homer just goes back to hating Ned at the end of the episode \s\sBut I think Homer softened up to him toward the end of the episode leading to this exchange. He saw that no matter what he put Ned through he was always patient and nice to him.Golden age Simpsons was just on another level. Could make you laugh and cry in the same scene.The Simpsons | GONE WHOLESOME!!! | GONE PHILOSOPHICAL!!!Anybody got more of that sweet Homer?Awww..damn HomeyWow that is such a beautiful thing to say. I'm really touchedGreat quote!\s\s[Another scene in the same vein that I really like comes from the episode Homer the Heretic.](https://youtu.be/k-gFQjj43XY?t=2m14s) The Simpsons' house catches on fire and Homer concludes that God is spiteful and and angry. Ned replies:\s\sNed: Homer God didn't set your house on fire!\s\sLovejoy: No but he was working in the hearts of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid be they Christian Jew or miscellaneous.""\s\sIt's honestly one of the best quotes I've seen about religion from a TV show.\s\s[Bonus car chase scene from the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfIVrsC-v3s)You can't wait six months?  :)I've never watched the Simpsons before and I've always felt like I'm missing out. Just stick to the first 7 seasons pretty muchI’m not crying you’re cryingThat’s my dad need proof I got my drivers license haha!!!

Isn't Ned's whole point that he's a preachy fallacy toting goody two shoes religious hypocrite? He wouldn't be a Satire of the typical American Christian otherwiseThat last frame isn't just him being sympathetic but his own humility. I live when writing alone gives me chills. r/frisson Why does this sub always make me cry I kept waiting for it to go downhill; so glad it never did Literally just got Season 5 on DVD and had just started this episode when I saw this.I was expecting a joke to undercut all that sincerity and wholesomenessWholesimpsonShut up.

\sThe biggest issue I have with the newer Simpsons is the fact it's trying to be Family Guy. But The Simpsons were never like that they used to be good wholesome family entertainment that the entire family could sit down and enjoy.\s\sFamily Guy is fine I love it but I love it for a completely different reason. I don't look to Family Guy for insight and morals and I don't look to The Simpsons for jackass humor. > good wholesome family entertainment\s\sIt was not considered this at all in the 90’sI never thought I'd see the words ""good wholesome family entertainment"" and ""MyCockIsRotting"" on the same comment. \s\sAffordable track-housing made them neighbors but Homer made them friends  funnyWould it be? Flanders is weird as hell. Him being religious is his only redeeming quality.Ah yes this is one of my favorite episodes! Season 5 Episode 16.This is Ned Flanders my friend!\s\sWhat did he say?\s\sI dunno something about being gayI feel so wholesome...❤️Its stuff like this that makes it really hard to enjoy new simpsons. They just dont feel human anymoreSo Ned’s bad now?[deleted]He literally has a [TVtrope named after him](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) because as the seasons went on his personality of being considerate and attentive with well behaved children (a polar opposite of Homer) was eclipsed by his religion. He's a caricature of Christian goody-two-shoes now and in that example. But he used to just be a polite doormat that went to church on Sundays (something nearly every character on the show has done).I agree completely. Ned is a satire and he always will be. Homer's fallacious interpretation of him is just shoehorned in here as a hokey feel good moment by someone who doesn't have the intellectual capacity to truly understand what he himself is saying (i.e. basically just Homer in a nutshell)Flanders filing his taxes on Jan 1st is one of the weirdest memories I keep from the show. #BREATHE THROUGH YOUR DAMN MOUTHBREATH THROUGH YOUR DAMN MOUTH!

A childhood iconI remember him mostly from Star Trek Voyager. Good actor! Hahaha his one scene in the last episode? Not the 150+ episodes and 4 movies of TNG he was in? Happy Birthday ""Mr. LaForge""...I can’t believe Geordi La Forge and Kunta Kinte taught me the joys of reading.you know he had to read it to emWhat at great guy!It must be because he's black not because his show apparently wasn't as popular.I wasn’t a great reader growing up but this man kept love in my heart for books. Now I’m a MA Lit student. Love this man.And he accomplished all of this whilst been blind...truly an inspirationHe had to do it to us I wish I were LeVar Burton...He's a character on weird city. Can we please settle this for 7 year old me? Was he blind (st:tng) or not (reading rainbow)? So many mixed emotions!!!HOLY SHIT I DIDN'T KNOW LEVAR BURTON WAS THE GUY FROM READING RAINBOW! I was so young when I watched it I didn't really know anything about actors. That's fucking great.Ringo Starr and George Carlin were both Mr. Conductor on Shining Time StationThis mofo used to be part of my homeschool curriculumCommander Geordi LaForge was one of the characters that taught me as a man that asking questions and always trying to learn was a quality that the world needs.\s\sHappy BirthdayAbsolutely a huge influence. Makes Wishbone look like a mutt.I'm so excited my daughter is finally at an age to watch this show!!! It's on Amazon prime and we watch it all the time. Was a big favorite of mine still is tooI skipped school as much as I could throughout elementary school. Reading Rainbow was a big part of keeping me entertained during  the day. I especially enjoyed the narrated stories where an illustrator would draw scenes from the book as it was being read.Lol community Had to do it him\sHe just had to do it to 'emStarted as a slave learned to read graduated Starfleet Academy and became chief engineer on the enterprise. Great role model.Roots!No idea who this guy was but this guy was an absolute bastard! LEVARRRR!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️He has a daughter too. I think she reports for Blizzard in the Overwatch League.Not to mention the greatest chief engineer starfleet has ever seen.I loved that show when I was growing up❤️ Jordy La’Forge\s\s🦋 Reading Rainbow 🌈 You can’t disappoint a photo!JUST TAKE A LOOK\s\sITS IN A BOOKno scandals? he's on par with rodgers and bob ross and Goku!Ok but hear me out. \s\sGoku ain't even raise his family he just went out fighting dudes across the galaxy and also dying just cuz.[Actually...](https://youtu.be/FBHwmVlP_DE)Only thing I know is that he read ""Go the Fuck to Sleep"" on a Rooster Teeth After Life charity stream and got some flack for it (mainly the cursing) so he's not gonna read anything risky like that anymore :(Probably not Goku. Maybe Deku if we're going for people who are too pure. He really is such an amazing inspiration and a great role model for young kids. \s\sI remember waking up extra early each school day and watching Reading Rainbow before the bus came at 8:30 All my older sibling were already off to school my parents would still be asleep. I'd just be me a bowl of cereal and PBS. Each time Levar read a new book or had the kids read one I'd go to school and try to find it in the library. My parents were immigrants they didn't really read us books growing up but LeVar and Reading Rainbow did. And it wasn't even just about books it was about diversity and empathy and showing kids the world. Still remember when he went to visit CATS on broadway and STOMP and when he showed us the set of star trek when they talked about growing up with a parent in prison & so many more!!! Reading Rainbow and LeVar Burton most certainly ignited a love of reading for me. He definitely deserves to be on that list of humans that bring kindness into our lives. Happy birthday to LeVar! May his birthday be free of coolant leaks and warp core breaches.I love this guy “but you don’t have to take my word for it.”He basically tried to teach a generation how to fact-check.This needs to be higher upHow can he be 62!That dude is blind and he is teaching all kids to read braille. My hero. Funny wasn’t around for mr Rodgers but boy was I around for reading rainbow I always thought Reading Rainbow ended its run earlier.  I guess I was wrong - 2001 for Mr Rogers and 2006 for Reading Rainbow. That song has been stuck in my head for 25 years Fun fact  he voiced BUBBLE in adventure time!I took a look in a book because of him\sI can hear this picture Such an amazing human being The intro is forever burned into my brain.

I really wished they aired it now a days for kids instead of all the crap on TV now. \s\sAlso Wishbone and Arthur probably had a part in my love for reading and literature too.

In his defense I'm sure he was just tired though.Take a look it’s in a book!Don't shit on Lavar because you like someone better. TF is wrong whit you?I liked him as Geordi la forge best. I liked how calm and collected Geordi was but he was a true friend and good at fixing things.

\soh shit reading rainbow\s\si watched this every damn day*READING RAINBOW*Love him!!!! It always confused me because I thought he was blind. I suppose books helped him get his eyesight back. They can help you be anything and find ways to grow as well as friends to know. You know he had to do it to emHe's 62?  Holy fuck I'm old.[My reaction when I met my idol](https://m.imgur.com/r/reactiongifs/Z3M4x) \sHe was my childhood. Star Trek would come out after Reading Rainbow  (not on the same channel) and I only started watching it because he was in it.  It was so surprising the first time I saw him in something other than reading rainbow. I totally thought he was just a reading guy .Same! :)Right? The Star Trek Reading Rainbow episode was one of the best. One of my kids and I had the great fortune of running into Mr. Burton recently. My son is very shy and was reluctant to say hi and generally I think celebrities don't need people intruding in their lives. LeVar noticed my son looking and greeted him which made him very happy. \s\sSo thanks to him. He was definitely one hero of ours that did not disappoint. Oh man I remember the episode where he visits a slave transporting ship... He just had a way of making books and stories come to life. What a great show. God I loved this guy when I was a kid. It sucks but its cause hes not dead. Once he dies he'll be up there with Bob and Mr. Rodgers. We have a weird way of not appreciating things till its too late. Then we over compensate when its too late. Glad to see this post Burton is a treasure.I'm a bot *bleep* *bloop*.

He had to do it to usYOU CAN’T DISAPPOINT A PICTURE!And is nobody going to mention that hes also the BEST CHARACTER IN TNG???It astounds me that he's more famous for Reading Rainbow than he is for Star Trek of even the historic miniseries Roots! Roots caused race riots fam! Great man. On a side note I can’t read his name without hearing Sheldon say “TV’s Lavar Burton”👉🌈👉 https://youtu.be/7Kq5YpExonc?t=75lol i never watched reading rainbow as a kidI can still hear the enthusiasm when he read the books. Seemed like a genuine guy.Hell ya I loved Geordie LaforgeAmazing 😉 I’m not personally familiar with this man’s work but I do know enough to see what an amazing man he is. I do ever so like people who positively influence the youth. ive been scrolling all the way down here to try and find out who he is and what he did but i dont see anything except star trek and reading rainbow which i know nothing aboutJordan Peele just came out with a new show on YouTube called Weird City that LeVar’s on and it’s pretty dope.

My older brother thought it was a lame show and relished in getting my goat by singing along but with his own asshat version of the lyrics. I had a fiery temper and usually punched him right around the time he got to “I can’t do anythiiiiing!”\s\sI will defend your honour to the death Mr. Burton. My happiest memories in elementary school are singing along to the reading rainbow theme song with my classmates.  When the teacher wheeled in the big tv and turned down the lights you knew it was going to be a good day.As is tradition. Including but not limited to: Magic Schoolbus and Bill Nye the Science Guy.I need to find the Reading Rainbow online somewhere so I can share another piece of my childhood with my daughter.\s\sThere's something so wonderful about seeing your kid love something that brought you joy when you were their age. So many feels.Reading Rainbow Bill Nye Magic School Bus and Between the Lions were some of the best parts of elementary school :’)The episode where he put on magic hats and got transported to the model train place was my shit as a kid. Thanks to this guy and Wishbone I was a literary scholar by age 12. \s\sRespect ✊ Anyone else just stare when you see him without the visor? It's like you've seen the guy for years but haven't really seen him.I was all ""this face looks familiar but also not familiar"" too.It's the most conflicting feeling of familiarity and complete unfamiliarity. He is an enigma.Omg who didnt sing along when the reading rainbow came on?!He’ll always be Geordie to me. As a kid I assumed the actor was actually blind and the visor helped the actual actor see. Man that would’ve been some incredible technology at the time. \s\sHappy b-day Geordie. He has a podcast now! Levar Burton Reads - which is exactly what it sounds like him reading a bunch of stories to you.He also narrated *The Good Neighbor: The Life and Works of Fred Rogers*. That's right you can listen to this man narrate Mister Roger's lifeOMG. Dreams do come true!Wish it was on Spotify. I don't know where to find it.\s\sEdit: After waking up to find a ton of new messages I now know it's on Spotify. I just could never find itThank you This is a really good podcast series! A lot of cool short stories. Reading Rainbow really was a big inspiration as far as tv goes62?? Man looks amazing.For some reason the only Reading Rainbow memory I have is when he had the [epic mullet guy do shadow puppets.](https://youtu.be/8MsxhrVum_U?t=507) It pops in my head about once a year...That’s just itBut don’t take my word for it!He was most recently on Weird City which is one of YouTubes few good originals.  He is in almost every episode 👌.We need to make this a thing. Dude is a legend. Geordi was one of my favorite characters in Next Generations growing up. In Insurrection when the planet grants him the ability to see without implants and says he’s never seen a sunrise before makes me cry every time. Wasn’t the best of the movies but it had its moments. He better be goodJordy I love ya man!Good guy Levar Burton.I wish i were LeVar Burton! More credit !  He needs more credit!   Jesus just because this loser hive hasn’t whored him out for karma doesn’t mean he isn’t great.  Well we don't have to take *your* word for it.\s\sHe's looking darn good I must say.Geordi!This guy..I don’t know this guy but if he’s half as nice as y’all say he is I guess he’s all right He’s from Germany. Take me back to elementary school man wow what a fuckin time manyeet[deleted]His daughter Mica works on OWL now.Bob Ross Fred Rogers and Steve Irwin have all passed away.

CAN YOU IMAGINE!?!? A show that won 26 Emmy awards and was the 3rd longest running kids show in the history of PBS and none of the kids I went to school with have ever heard of it let alone watched it. Reading Rainbow was a huge part of my childhood. LeVar Burton is the best!I WISH I WAS LEVAR BURTONNever forget he put a phone in the microwave because ""it was wet""#BUTTERFLY IN THE SKYYYYYES! He is definitely part of the living holy trinity. Love knowledge. Oh hey I didn't know it was his birthday! I was just reading about a park in Sacramento that's gonna be named after him!\s\s>Sacramento Park's Commission will rename Richfield Park in Meadowville to LeVar Burton Park.\s\s>Richfield Park three acres in total was recently upgraded by the city.

Wow I’m actually proud to be from there now Wow I’m a sac native and didn’t know he was from here or that we were getting a park named after him. I’m a failure. Rogers and Ross are getting the extra LOVE because the DIED.\s\sGet your head out of your area OP.\s\sI’d like to see Levar around for a long time.\s\sAlso he gets plenty of love.\s\sMany know Reading Rainbow and I don’t know anyone that’s got anything but love for him and the program. :)Thank you Geordi! You always kept the enterprise running smooth and got me into reading... truly a credit to the space time continuim!You know something. You right. 🙌🏻 levar!holy damn; black don't crack for shit huhThis man is a legendHells yeah. Love this guy. Reading rainbow was amazing.  Watched it everyday. I told you I just wanted a pictureAwesome show but you don’t have to take my word for it. This man changed my childhood for the better! [I TOLD PIERCE A THOUSAND TIMES: I NEVER WANTED TO MEET LEVAR BURTON; I JUST WANTED A PICTURE. YOU CAN’T DISSAPOINT A PICTURE](https://youtu.be/MhOG3XwX9Yw)Is this Mica Burton's dad? I only know Achievement Hunter and RT mostly by proxy so I can't be sure.  Yeah that’s her dad. In AHWU 200 he even makes a cameo in the intro and Jack said his daughter was a big fan of them too. Yup! That's her dadThey got him to read a special book during Extra Life [2014](https://youtu.be/gZoXGitkpNk).As others have said it is. Sadly she doesn’t work at RT anymore but she is one of the interviewers at the Overwatch League nowOK but you folks need to go watch the music video for Cameo - Word Up. This will get buried but if anyone has YouTube premium or whatever it's called Lavar has a recurring role in a show called Weird City produced by Jordan Peele. It's actually really entertaining.This man was my very first celebrity crush. Here’s to an exceptional human!This mother fucker was saving lives across the universe with captain Jon like bacard too Breh. #startrecknextgeneration Player 3 has entered the game My favorite reading rainbow episode was LeVar in a hat store. Everytime he put on different hat it transported him to somewhere new. That and the optical illusion episode. this man defined my early elementary school experience You don’t have to take my word for it. He was a guest speaker at my uni couple years ago. He took time after to meet meet everyone who came down to meet him or shake his hand or ask a question. He stayed for almost another hour with students. He’s a fantastic person and a huge role model of mineThis dude read me a story a few months ago. The best thing I ever paid for in my life. He has a special place in my heart.Was he the guy with the visor thing in Star Trek?Honestly I've had a really bad day and seeing this post honoring this beautiful human cheered me upThis dude is awesome. His laugh is the best it always put a huge smile on my face or I'd laugh too when I was a little kid.https://youtu.be/-FD1K8OvVCsI literally sped scrolled through all of the comments looking for the blue links. You are the only one (I believe) who has linked to him and I thank you for this.\s\sI couldn’t remember he name unfortunately. I have lost touch with my childhood. But I definitely remember now. \s\sI miss being a child....*sometimes*.Geordi Laforge will live forever most likelyIf Captain Picard is any indication then yes. He just keeps reversing the polarity of his aging coils! :D[deleted]Epic Geordi ManeuverAt least for the next couple of hours Captain.Hmhmmm I’m not aware who this is can someone story me?Former host if a children's show Reading Rainbow which read stories and encouraged kids to readLieutenant la forge baby!He really did it to usHe used to be pretty regularly talked about on Reddit. He hasn't been given high on the list lately but he certainly is a Reddit favorite. \s\s&#x200B;|)   \sI created this Geordi emoji when I was a little kid.  \sThe DMX remix of the reading rainbow theme song is a beautiful gift to humanityI loved this guy when I was a kid! The theme song is stuck in my head now lolAgreed!!For real! Fucking loved this guyFor the first probably 6 years of my life the most interesting fact that I knew was that the reading rainbow dude was on Star Trek.# I WISH I WAS LEVAR BURTON#WARP SPEED CAN'T RAINBOW READ ME# WHERE'S MY ICONIC SLAVE ROLE?**YOUR NAME IS TOBY**What's up with claymation? I mean what's up with it?A mile a minute!It was LeVar Burton that convinced me a young white man that systematic racism was still a problem in this country. I saw an interview with him on a major news network where he said if he ever gets pulled over by the cops he goes the extra mile by putting both hands out the window and placing them palm down on the outside of the door just to make the cop extra comfortable.\s\sI was like hell if this guy of all people has to worry about this sort of thing then there must really be something to it.This is eerie but I literally came here to post this exact anecdote about myself. We talk a lot about police violence against black people but there is sometimes a sense that it's scary thugs who are mid-crime or who resist arrest. People who contribute to violence against themselves.\s\sBut this is the nice man you watched in school who helped you get into books and who switched costumes to go to his night job on Star Trek that you watched with dad. This was a person of color you became fond of long before you'd absorbed enough American racism to be a part of it.\s\sWhen I read about him removing his hat and glasses and putting his hands in a visible place during a traffic stop it transported me back in time to before I'd absorbed a lot of cultural bullshit and made me realize that even the nicest people in America who have made vast contributions to society might live in fear because of their race. That broke my heart but more importantly it changed my mind.Being born in 94 this guy WAS my bob ross Butterfly in the skyyyyy i can go twice as hiiiiigh. Take a look it's in a book! The reading rainbow! IIIIIIII can be anything! Friends to know ways to grow the reading rainbow..... i sing that all the time lol drives my co workers nutsJordi put your visor back onIt is so sad that he is blind and cannot read many books.  I wonder if his visor is able to translate text to speech?BIG FACTS He made me like reading books can’t believe he’s 62 time flies man...Levar made reading interesting and in a way Geordie made engineering seem exciting too.I still remember watching the Star Trek TNG episode of RR as a kid and realizing ""Holy shit that is Geordi!""I see so much nostalgic shit on Reddit that I was never into but I loved reading rainbow as a kid. I always find he looks weird without the visor like seeing someone without their glasses for the first time. That in itself is strange because I knew him as the reading rainbow guy before he was ever GeordyI looooved reading rainbow! 🌈 And reading between the lions. PBS KIDS THIS SHIT WAS MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD62!!?! WHERE ? As a kid I didnt like the show much but I'd always listen to the intro song. Didn't have a nice childhood and not much happy feelings but that song would cheer me up for some reason for as long as it lasted lol.I wish I was LaVar Burton... I wish I was LaVar Burton...You need a new desk>[Came here for this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaWa4ScfQXc&feature=youtu.be&t=110)To a little little black kid who loved to read this was my hero.LeVar Burton is an amazing man. But you don't have to take my word for it!This guy was my hero in both Star trek and his educational program growing upOh look! It's geordie laforgeMy man's 62 and doin it to em.\s\sGod bless you LB.The theme song to reading rainbow popped in my head the other day.  I immediately googled it to listen to it.  I thought my older brother might make a snide comment as we are a family of smartasses.\s\sNope.  He started singing along.Set phases to love me! Great show....Rodgers...So many people can't resist shoving their D into Fred RogersYES! Every time there's talk about the wholesome pantheon I raise my voice to include him! Cheers! Inspired many people to read.  📚💕26th*He might be the Reading Rainbows guy to some of you folks but he'll always be Geordi La Forge in my mind.This and the Pizza Hut BookIt were my favoriteThis dude here that’s my mr. rogers.My hometown (Sacramento) just decided to rename a park after him. He went to my high school apparently. So he's a home town hero at least.Seeing LeVar on the Reading Rainbow and Star Trek was how I first learned that actors could play multiple different roles and weren't just cast as the same character for lifeHe was the host of some show in the evening that was about homelessness and/or mental illness or something (I could have this completely wrong I was only about 3 or 4) and I saw him when going from channel to channel. I was convinced it was RR because that was the ONLY show he could be on. My mom let me watch part of it to try to convince me and I remember getting angry that he wasn’t reading any booksHonestly this was my favorite. We’d watch this in first grade. But you don't have to take my word for it... 😍😍😍“But don’t take my word for it”I'm drunk and I'm crying *subtly* while hanging out with friends. Reading rainbow was the unspoken happiness of my life and I didn't realize it until I saw this post. Okay Reading Rainbow kids was anyone as upset as I was when they swapped the opening song from a man to a woman singing it? Not sure why but little 6 year old (girl) me was about to have a riot and seriously told my parents I was going to write a letter and complain....Hate to burst some bubbles but I met him years ago when he came up to Maine to film a segment for the show.\s\sHe was an absolute prick.  Complete prima-donna.\s\sMaybe he was having a bad day but the way he threw his shit around had my dad ready to toss him overboard and let him swim to shore.\sNever seen my dad like that with a guest on his boat before or since.\sSorry Levar but there is only one captain on a ship the guy in the center chair. \sThink he would have figured that shit out.\s\sThis guy is NOT in the same wheelhouse as Bob & Fred.Take a look!If you like Game of Thrones and Reading Rainbow then check this out. https://youtu.be/2lnPyUQ3KYMI'll let him know I appreciate him when he gets back from traveling the world with Troy.PBS is the greatest channel for children’s programming.\s\sChange my mind.YouTube Kids is the worst anything for children’s programming i remember him and the show well.This great an all but you guys realized he doing it us?62? gtfo.  Dude's forhead is as smooth as a baby's ass with no wrinkles.You know he had to do it to emThanks to him I stopped watching pornography on the television...\s\sInstead I decided to read pornography and let my imagination run wild I was never into Bob or Rogers growing up.  But when the Reading Rainbow music came on while I was doing something I'll be running to the living room to catch the newest books read by Mr. Rainbow himself...I thought that was his name and he was all the voices... Maybe I should have watched more of Mr. Wizard.Butterfly in the sky\sI can go twice as high\sTake a look\sIt's in a book\sA Reading RainbowI wish I could have a signed picture of LeVar Burton. Oh my goodness I had so completely forgotten about the reading rainbow that when I saw this I almost teared up hes a national hero That pose. You know I had to read it to em’But don’t take myyyyy word for it...The last piece of the wholesome trinity... do I upvote because I love LeVar or downvote because of how unnecessarily desperate the title is...That moment when Troy meets him in community. That was golden.I met LeVar Burton in Toronto once and he was soooo lovely! The first thing I said was ""Thank you for reading rainbow! I'm a fan since childhood"".I can hear the theme song to R.R. in my head by just looking @ his picture I remember being brought into the school library to watch this every few weeks in elementary school.Butterfly in the skyI can go twice as high \s\sThanks for the silver!

I would never not wear it.Saw him on a NCIS New Orleans episode this week. He’s looking great! One of my favorite humans of all time.Why isn’t he in the engine room? And where is his uniform??It's probably the holodeck.  He's getting ready for his date with holo Leah Brahms.His podcast brings me life. Just take a look it's in a book!In my early childhood he encouraged me to read more.\s\sIn my teenage years he showed me how bad ass an engineer in space can be.\s\sLove this son of a bitch!Happy birthday!More fish for KuntaI can hear the song. I have other music playing right now and I can still hear the song.Would anyone care to educate me on who this is. I think I’m a little too young to have grown up with this guy.Geordi LaForgeI shook his hand once. Best day of my life.“But don’t take my word for it”.  Literally taught me free thinking! Thanks lavar!The way the theme song sings *Reading Rainbow* is the exact way I read all italics The reason he doesn't get much credit is probably because he isn't dead yet people only miss you when youre gone Wasn't he in Star Wars? He was the robot with yellow eyesYeah but thats because he's still around tossing those positive vibes out.  He's def in the vibe tribe hall o' fame. But do we really trust Bob and Fred if they just died on us. Nahh we got Levar now!! Is he doing it to em?He is a fantastic man to meet In person !Had the pleasure of meeting this gem of a person once upon a time ago. Honestly a great guy. Feliz Cumpleaños LeVar!He's super friendly on Twitter too. I had a short exchange with him and Gates a few years ago on there. Fantastic and friendly!Bob Ross was obviously a great guy but this man played a part in my childhood that I still remember. We need so much more LeVar Burton love!!I tell all my friends about him and they all say they don’t know this reading rainbow icon. I’m so glad everyone remembers this beaut. I still sing the song sometimes. I miss being a child. Heck of a point!The holy Trinity of wholesome I have a picture with him from when I was in 4th grade! He was the celebrity visitor at the William Allen White reading awards in my state. I carelessly slammed open a door and ended up almost knocking him out with it. When I realized who he was I felt so ashamed and embarrassed but he was so sweet about it! He took a picture with me and my friends and signed our books too. He was such a cool guy! Levar is having a park named after him in Sacramento!The Trinity is complete.Awwwwww those cuties! I wanna be in the middle of that friendship sandwich This is fantastic. Made me smile and they both look so happy.Aw their mustaches are so cuteSikhs are the best. My man has some Sikh building skills.r/humansbeingbrosthat's pretty sikhI hope that Sikh man gets better maybe his friend will repay him with some medicine.

\sThe Sikh temple in my community also serves the Hindu community because their population is a lot lower and they can’t afford a temple.  Pretty cool stuff.

I'm not going to finish that (for obvious reasons)Is it miniaturized? It looks too small to stand in.

Good stuff. 1000 commentThat hug gives me life. Look how tightly they’re squeezing one another!Beautiful :) Genuinely curious is there something about the architecture that makes a mosque a mosque specifically? Like can't any building be a mosque as long as Muslims worship inside it?Yes. Any building can be a mosque. I'm guessing there wasn't a mosque around here for Muslims to pray in so he made this Old but goldYeah I think we're good on that whole humanity and Muslim thing lol.But isn't it said that god is eveywhere and you can pray even in your home? That hug is as special as everything else in this picture. This is wonderful Sikh are genuinely nice people from what interactions I've personally had.

Yes but some religions believe you need to go somewhere specific to do so. Yup but it’s encouraged to pray in a mosque and with others since it yields more reward.\s\sSource: Am Muslim.Imagine a world where everyone demonstrated this level of caring and selflessness[removed][removed][removed]Cant you pray anywhere?Who is America?There actually is good in this world! Just warms my heartCan we talk about how awesome sikh people are? Great bunch of peopleMad respect for my Sikh brosCan’t muslims technically pray anywhere? Goin to the mosque 2 mandeep Sikh meme bro!I pray that you do not make that joke againthanksThis hug is a good hug look at the fervent squeezeHas he gotten better?SIKHS ARE FUCKING AWESOMEI misread pray as party at first lmaoI acctually started tearing up. This is so sweet This is the most beautiful thing in the world. I think it cured my bad night <3 It’s cute though r/humansbeingbrosA Sikh man indeed!I'm a Christian but I don't remember ever reading anything bad about Sikhs as a group.  In fact I generally see really positive things about em.\s\sAlso gotta respect a faith that commands the adherents to protect those who cannot protect themselves.\s\s<3I mean Christianity says to do that but a lot of people kinda choose to ignore those sections. In the mid 1980s there was a relatively strong Sikh nationalist movement in India that includes terrorist elements. Said terrorists blew up [Air India Flight 182](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182) en route from Vancouver and Montréal to London and New Delhi killing 329 people. A second bomb was supposed to take down another flight going westbound but the bag [exploded at Narita Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Narita_International_Airport_bombing) before it could be loaded onto the plane.\s\sI mention this attack not to demonize Sikhs in any way only to point out that all religious groups — all large groups of humanity really — have their positive and negative influences on the world. Sikh nationalism has pretty much died out in the 33 years since the attack. And I hope more people will take inspiration for their actions from photos like this post’s and not from violence and hatred.Well all religions and non-religious groups have done terrible things. Sikhs included.\s\sIts best not to ponder about the evils of man. Can we not generalize about religion at all here? Because it's not gonna end well even if it's well intentioned. People do god-awful things in the name of religion just as they do beautiful compassionate things. It's just not reliable or fair or just to say oh he's a Sikh so he's a nice guy.\s\sHe's a nice guy and he happens to be Sikh.> I'm a Christian but I don't remember ever reading anything bad about Sikhs as a group\s\sMull that statement over for a second. There were Sikh's who blew up a plane in a terrorism attack in Canada but that doesn't say anything about Sikh's as a group.\s\sSame with every religion. \s\s(And if I can opine a bit Christianity is just bad and incoherent philosophy but that doesn't say anything about Christians as a group.)Thanks a huge part of out religion is ""we just don't like bullies""Sikhs have been tame in comparison to a lot of other religions.  They are almost always chill.  They had a violent nationalists movement for a bit but that seems to have been forgotten by the community itself. So hecking cute. Brightened my day We can all Sikh to learn something about Humanity from Sihks.I smell an infidel. This dude's sikhThere's this one sikh guy in my school had classes with him last year didn't know much English but everyone knew he was pretty cool What's the problem to pray at your home???yall fellas just ever build your hommie a building???I would  but all my friends disowned me for being atheist jokes on them ;-; I build cardboard castles for my cats all the time.What are the rules? I’m down. I build a pillow fort for my best mate when I was 9.\s\sWe played taken 3 for 5 hoursSomeday Hope the sikh man is doing well 😊I think that’s a crazy amazing thing for a human being to do. To be so thoughtful and caring about another person is truly beautiful. I just wonder.. if you 100% believe in your religion would you be 100% supportive of your friend being in another? \s\sI have a religion and I don’t talk about religion with my friends at all. Like ever. I support their right to choose to do whatever they want with their life. ..but I still do want them not end up in hell you know?JustSNThingsNice green screen yoThis makes me so happy. ❤️What a mensch.Victory RoyaleThat's a cool looking little mosque. I'd pray in that mosque and I'm an atheistI've always appreciated the architecture of places of worship aside from the majority of Christian churches as they mostly look like they come off an assembly line. What can I say when your religion espouses the pursuit of all knowledge art geometry and architecture make something beautiful. [removed]I'm curious does it ever go the other way?\s\sI see stories occasionally about  Sikh people building things for others..  but do muslim people build for other religions?\s\s\sI really don't know anything about either of them but am curious.[deleted]I have seen this before but wow. Imagine your friend come up to you and say: hey so i heard x means a lot you so i built you a building broDude this guy is sihk. He was able to muslim up a mosque. \s\sI ran out of puns. SorryNow waiting for a Moslem to build a Sikh temple. LOL.God bless ! ❤️Sick!Hope that Sikh man gets to feeling better soon. Seems like a nice guy. What a nice guy. I hope he gets healthier soonwhat makes you think he’s unhealthy?Nice.SikhSikh and ye shall find.That looks like a good hugThe best part about this is you know there are so people just learning that there's a difference between the twoAHAHAHAHA THATS SO TRUE!!! I’m a Muslim and I’ve gotten “wait I thought you were like Indian” before... they meant Hindu... and I’m Bangladeshi XDNah man the best part is that they are so kind :iBack in 2011 in the UK there were riots up and down the country with people looting and vandalising everything. It was mainly due to escalation of events following a fatal police shooting of a young man however it was used by many as an excuse to just go mad unfortunately. \s\sIt just so happened to have taken place during the month of Ramadan where Muslims attend a night prayer at mosques during this time Sikhs stood outside the mosques as deterrents to any potential vandals. Muslims did the same and protected the Sikh temples while the Sikhs did their own night-time prayers (Kirtan Sohila). They both came together to protect churches within the city too. \s\s[Here’s the article from the local news](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-riots-muslims-and-sikhs-guard-159529) \sSikh’s are some of the nicest most generous and tolerant people I have ever met. Really good guy. Any friend would be good :/ damn - sikh mosqueGuess you could say that was really \s#SikhThis is what puts my faith back in people! Look out for each other respect one another and help each other. [deleted]That’s the problem isn’t it? It’s as if there’s a sort of carnal drive to *take* and *have*.Can someone just build is mosque ? Like obviously it looks like one but doesn’t it need an Imam or blessing or something? \sStill a cool picture. I hope he gets better God I love sikhs. My heart... this is so pure they’re so happy oh my goodness this is wonderfulheartwarming life-affirming fuckin awesomeness.That is pretty Sikh indeed.Tbh he could’ve prayed anywhere - you don’t need a mosque to prayWonderful. When our eyes are set towards heaven we are all family.Hope he gets better soon!I like the green color.Green has a special significance in Islam as it’s the color of Paradise Sikhs are lovely people in general. I don’t remember the last time i heard someone talk bad about Sikhs. Im muslim by the wayTheir whole outlook on life and religion is great. They basically believe there is no wrong way to God so are accepting of different faiths. I've known a lot a Sikhs and they are all a bunch of lovely people with one exception. But that's just because he just had a shit personality.People don't talk bad about Sikhs because they carry swords and know how to use them.\s\sJust kidding but ya my Sikh friends have always been super chill. It's a solid culture.For nicest stereotyped religious persons I think it would go Sikhs Mormons Lutherans. I’ve met some real asshole Buddhists but that could just be because I live in Colorado.As a religion they seem great. Unfortunately like many religions/religious cultures as soon as you try and marry into that religion when you aren't the same there's A LOT of issues. Sikhism especially is hard  because you cannot even convert if you wanted to you're just screwed.[removed]My dad had a Sikh at his work who assaulted a woman in the elevator. So here you go. “It would be great if human beings were great at being human and if all of mankind was made of people that were kind.”\s\sThis is it. It's nice to be nice. It's good to be good.I wholeheartedly agree. \s\sI guess the only thing left to do is find out how to delete these few pesky lines in Islamic scripture that command Muslims to either kill or convert the non-believers.This is dope!Why does this mosque look like shrek?*WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY MOSQUE??*Because it has layers. I just want stuff like this to happen everywhere.Can u build me a house plzThey do but they get overshadowed by hate in the media because that's what gets clicks. When you’re a veteran at a game and decide to help out your newbie friendWonder if the Muslim man specifically asked for it to be neon green. Bold color choice but I bet God was happy to see some flair.\s\sEdit: TIL green is associated with Islam.in South Asian cultures lots of Islamic buildings tend to be some shape of Green  usually bright green. I'm not sure why tbh.Almost all mosques I've seen in my life were green coloured. I heard it's because prophet Mohammed liked the colour green.Well my dude if I’m going to guess the Muslim man most certainly did. He wanted it to be easily visible to everyone so he could be like “yo check this out. My buddy built me a mosque just because! Fucking badass right?!” \s\sNot a Muslim but I believe what's most important is that it's plain and white from the inside which it seems to be. Big fan of the neon green though.I’m from Delhi. But I’m not Muslim. However I’ve noticed Muslim communities have a lot of green in them and even a lot of Islamic countries have green flags (Pakistan Saudi Arabia etc). It’s a really nice atmosphere in these communities especially the amazing music that rings throughout that area. Such a shame that this type of religion has the worst reputation possibleThey’re going to replace it with a better mosque in post-production That’s sik.So ge can green screen it into whatever cool pattern he wants. Green is a very prevalent colouring Islam. I cannot upvote this enough.  This isn't some fake act of kindness for internet points this is real.[deleted]Faaabulous! r/wholesomemuslimr/subsyoufellforOk this is so sweet 😭 Now if someone would just rebuild Sheryl’s she-shed for her. Wow. I simply love this picture itself. I'm actually Muslim and that grass green architectural masterpiece looks better than 9/10 mosques I've ever been to.\s\sI guess I could say I'm... \s\sGREEN WITH ENVY AHAHAH!!!Sikhs are truly wonderful people and are for the most part totally misunderstood. Sikhism is one of those religions that you just have to respect. They're like the sweet old lady that always brings cupcakes to the BBQ even though everyones fighting over family beefYeah just casually build a structure in the form of a building like ya do.Humanity goals is getting rid or religion.SiikkkhhhhhIs it made out of lime stone?I've never me a Sikh I didn't like. A letter/wordthat's not a sikh man that's the sikhest man.Human squee! Fuckin adorable!Sikh's are so based.Sikhs are kind of known for being chill like that. They're not fanatical like many would assume**sorts by controversial**Top comment says ""God is great"" Wow that's Sikh.Hope he gets better soon!r/MadeMeSmileDammit why can't humanity as a whole just be like these two?!!There’s hope for humanityCoolOne of my best friends is Sikh awesome guy all around his immediate and extended family are all awesome people as well. Love the culture very accepting while also being warriors. This is so old.[deleted]I think it’s in the sense that without an accessible mosque Muslims (in regions where they are minorities) tend to feel like outsiders.\s\sThe mosque is literally a gesture that says “You’re welcome here. Forever.”But I’m sure it is nice to have your own little place of worship LOUD NOISES!!Friendship goals is to create a portrait of your friend made out of thousands of dice.I read “sikh” as SICCWish this was the norm and not the exception...That's pretty SikhThese kinds of folks make up most of the islamic population. As with the right-wing and left-wings only a small fringe will ever go about bombing and attacking. Most are devout and pious people. Its wise to remember that to prevent divisions and paranoia because at the end of the day we’re all people and we all deserve respect and kindness.\s\sExcept Micah. Fuck MicahTHANK YOU. I’m just a girl in high school and everyone thinks I’m out to bomb the place. Like??That picture of the hug nearly has me in tears... just looks so damn wholesome.Definitely one of the best hugs ive ever seenI know! Same here :)I hope he gets better soon\sWow I can't even get out of bed when I'm Sikh!Jew Buddha be jokingSource? Most middle eastern folks I have met are very sweet accepting people. It's a shame that they get lumped in with extremists. I think even those of us who consider ourselves left leaning even forget just how *small* a percentage of the middle eastern populace is radicalized. It's positively infinitesimal compared to the global population. Also Sikhs rule. Have met some really nice bareass naked stick welding Sikhs walking the streets of India.  \s\sI think its also easy to forget just how many different faiths coexist in these countries. They get framed as all muslim uptight and intolerant but it's just not the case. r/HumansBeingBrosCmon I expected better from this sub than anti-Islam or anti-religion comments. Talk about that all you want but isn’t this sub for spreading smiled instead of condemning others? [removed][removed]Sikh mosque broSikh are the nicest mother fuckers in the world. Every single time I have interacted with a practicioner it has been nothing but an absolute delight. Such a wholesome collection of people.Can confirm. I did my MSc in Wales at a university that attracted people from all around the world. The Sikh students I met there seemed to all have figured out how to be pragmatically and authentically nice humans. this is exactly what religion should be about.[deleted]Does god actually care where you pray i thought the act of just praying was good enough So sikh bro ❤️Sikh male here- thanks for the nice comments friends! If you’re interested in more info about Joga Singh  and his efforts here you go: :) \s\s[Joga Singh Mosque ](http://www.sikhsonline.co.uk/sikh-man-builds-mosque-for-his-muslim-friend/) \s\sEdit 1: Groan at all the Sikh puns \s\sEdit 2: I’m a glutton for punishment and keep sikhing them out. \s\sEdit 3: [here’s another article since we hugged the first one to death ](https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/sikhs-rebuild-mosque-destroyed-during-partition-1.581831) I met a lot of Sikh people in my life and I must say that every single one of you have been nothing but incredible human beings! Keep doing what you do!damn hope you get well soon buddy !We gave it the reddit hug :(Oh lord the site was smitten by the Reddit Hug of Death.Can Sikhs marry Christians?Hey since you're here I wonder if I can ask you some questions. I've been wanting to visit a local gurudwara recently. Is it okay if I use a bandana I have at home to cover my head? Other than covering the head and taking off the shoes is there anything else manners-wise which I should know?\s\sAnd I'll be honest langar sounds great as well. What time is it usually served? :DBy any chance do you carry a sword around with you.Sikh too! Gotta love them puns eh? Lived in New Delhi the last four years and every Sikh person I met was kind and helpful and fun. Made some lifelong friends. What religion are most Sikhs I assumed most of you were Muslim. That's Sikh man !“Man Im pretty bummed. I don’t have anywhere to pray.” \s\s“Don’t worry dude I built you this mosque.”\s\s“Haha thanks that’s pretty sikh.”God is greatI don’t understand what this comment is trying to achieve lolreligion goalsYou will never ever convince me that people aren't basically goodI've been watching a ton of behind the scenes videos lately and all I keep thinking is ""they'll add some texture like stones or columns in vfx.""I hope he gets betterThat’s a good hug toomosque in background [deleted]Awwwwwww why are some people so good.sikhs are some of the nicest people in the world!Sikh never fail to impress me with how individually kind they are.Waheguru :)Dude that's pretty sikhBro that's sikh.All the funding came from Sajjan Singh Ghuman as well as other donations from Birmingham UK which has a large Sikh population.  Sajjan Singh is the older brother of Joga Singh who is the Sikh in the photo who manages their estate back home.  When this story got on TV in 2015 about a mosque that had been destroyed during partition was being rebuilt the Ghuman family didn't understand all the fuss.  It's just bros being bros.This made me cry a little bit. It's so nice to see a bit of kindness in the world still.That dude is Sikh with it.>he had nowhere to pray\s\s\sI didn't realize Muslim people actually needed to be in a mosque in order to pray? Maybe I'm wrong but I thought as long as the person faced Mecca it was fine. \s\s\sSorry for being ignorant I'm not exactly a religion expert Yeah they can pray anywhere that is clean as long as they try to face the right direction. However its bonus points to pray together with other people which is what mosques are built to house. Subscribe to PewDiePie. Get well soonWithin the Sikh community there are good and bad. I don't buy into The notion that all Sikhs are nice and wonderful. I've been around Sikhs all my life. Many Sikhs I've met seem to have an arrogance about them. They go on about being warriors. Not much humility.\s\s I see very little interaction with others outside the Sikh or greater Punjabi community. Very little intermarriage with non Punjabis. I wonder how many Sikhs invite Gorahs or blacks into their homes? I wonder if a Gorah could actually attend a langar without any trouble? \s\s They love money so much that they import large amounts of drugs into Canada to supply the illegal drug trade. No consideration for the lives they ruin with the drugs they import.\s\sSikhism is good. How most Sikhs I've met over the years really don't practice true Sikhism in their private and public lives. It is hard to resist the lure of big money or to control one's ego. Like every thing else there the ""ideal"" version and the real version.\s\s I not slagging Sikhs. Most people regardless of religion culture or ethnicity are shitty. Few can rise up and fight their own selfishness and ego. That's life. what a sihk friend.I wish there were better people in the world like this. It is a rarity to find someone so pure and whole.[deleted]I don’t know why your getting downvoted?Thanks pardnerThe only time a meme has its brightness reduced is when it’s a meme about having its brightness reduced. Kinda getting old.Very much appreciated:)Dude you are doing the lords work!! Its 4 pm this aint nothing Much appreciate c:I love this meme I love this subreddit and because of this subreddit I've learned what it's like to cry tears of joy because this place as restored my faith in humanity. First time even going on this subreddit today and I'm crying as I make this post.

I wish you all good luck and I pray for everyone in the world to have good luck and happiness in their lives. So as my last sentence in (the first version of this comment if I ever have to edit it) this comment no matter what darkness your life is going through there will be a light at the end of the tunnel because all you have to do is persevere and never give up hope because there is no such thing as true despair and once you get through this dark patch the light will just be all the more brighter.I love youFor those with iPhones there is a way to reduce brightness even further than most people know:\s\sSettings > General > Accessibility > Display Accomodations > Reduce White Point\s\sYou can turn it on then reduce brightness even further to reduce the stress on your eyes when browsing Reddit in the dark.

That guy has a sixth sense for these kinds of postsHe hasn’t been active in like two weeks. Hope nothing has happened. And me? :(Came to the comments and was a little disappointed.I had to sort to controversial in order to finally find this comment. Nice. I had to check to make sure this post wasn't made by him.I knew this kid in highschool! I saw that on his FB and was bawling Crying at the club rnVEry dankEAm I the only one who is also thinking of this?\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5d8pVg3QtgNo tbh I already knew what video it was b4 I clicked on the linkI was thinking of This Is Us and (context-free spoiler) the coffee cup in the Jeep.My Dad who was an avid golfer died on May 31 of this year. We thought we had cleaned up all of his practice balls from his yard. However my Mom still hits at least one every time she mows. I have been finding them in my house car etc. I have been hearing Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Knicks in particular everywhere lately. My Dad was a huge fan and I was going to be his and Mom's dd for their show Oct. 3. Now it will be me my mom my little brother and a portrait.My dad died the day before I left for college. My mom dad and I played a game where we hid a fake rubber cockroach in increasingly  ridiculous places in the bathroom. It had been lost for a while because my dad had forgotten where he had hid it (chemo side effect probably). The night he died we came home and I forget why but my mom needed baby powder for some reason--picked up the bottle and was surprised so bad by the fake cockroach falling out of the lid that she threw the bottle and the entire bathroom was COVERED. My dad won that game hands down forever. Amazing :) There’s lots of posts about rubber ducky’s on r/lawofattractionMy Dad had a little rubber ducky called Fred who he kept in his car. He found Fred in his garden one day and thought he was cute and so he drove with Fred for good luck. He died 12 years ago and I don't know what happened to Fred which makes me really upset. Miss you Dad. I really hope someone wouldn't fabricate that kind of story for internet points. But then again I'm quite the cynic.Big if trueThis will be me as an old man no doubt in my mind if you ever find ducks while taking a walk....\s\sOr even take a walk....\s\sWhat's fresh air?is somebody cutting le onions?Wow! I can almost hear that rubber duck saying ""good luck"" while you squeeze it you know instead of a simple ""quack""I'm not crying. You're crying! <3I have something in both my eyes...This will get lost in the comments but my dad loves to leave spare change everywhere in my house mostly my shoes. He knows I hate change and it pisses me off and I get mad when I find it. After seeing this I’m not gonna be so mad anymore and I’ll probably laugh at it now. I'm sitting here with my Dad. He just finished radaition for stage 4 prostate cancer. 76 yrs old career coast guard Vietnam veteran. \sHe's my best friend and I am terrified of the day he's gone... \sThis hit me hard. . . In an awesome way. \sI wonder what things my crazy Dad will leave for us to find. Best. \sYou rock OP. I'm sorry but why was he always finding rubber ducks?Near end of house party. Fall or winter so the cast iron wood stove was burning and throwing off heat to counteract the patio door being open almost constantly. Still a dozen or so people in living room\s\sPassed out friend staggers up wobbles over to the corner and proceeds to send billowing clouds of pee-steam sizzling off said stove. The room cleared out quickly\s\sHe was the host tho so nobody made a big deal of it. Of course he had no recollection the next day  \s\s\s  EDIT: LOL this was supposed to be on another thread about the weirdest thing you've ever seen at a party but I'll leave it here for funLol I was about to post this in r/ARedditorTellsAStory till your edit. Don't delete it it's awesome finding weird shit like this in random threads/r/lostredditorsOh wow. I was so confused because I just came from that thread. Good story thoughI just came from that thread so I read it and didn't quite realize I wasnt still there for a moment.In bubberducky you get to play AS bubberducky.I always wonder if these ""I'm crying"" comments are genuine. God I hope not. This year will be four years since my father passed.  Hit me straight at the heart strings with the duckies. Keep on quaking Dad. That's sad my Great Grandfather had a collection of obscure salt and pepper shakers and it's sad to see them still there but not him. So you haven’t opened your backseat cupholder for 4 years?I mean that’s pretty believable if you don’t have a lot of people in your car very often. I can't believe in 4 years someone wouldn't clean out their car. I always clean my cup holders because they get all damp from drinks. When I was a teenager in the late 90’s I had a corny little website I had written in html (lots of Papyrus but no blink tag at least) and I used it to showcase lists of things I liked and my dopey journal-type writing. I had a small collection of vinyl records so I added a LP wishlist to my website for all five of my readers to see. \s\s A few years after I finished high school I was living across the country and I got a copy of Cream’s Disraeli Gears in the mail from my dad with a note saying that he liked it too and he was happy to get it for me from my list. I kept the record in the taped-up plastic sleeve since my record player was broken and then I kind of forgot about it. \s\sI also collect pressed pennies from tourist destinations. You know the ones you pay fifty cents and a machine squishes a design into a penny? When my dad visited me in Colorado I took him to all the sights and we got pennies pressed at each one.\s\sAnyway. A couple of years go by he is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and dies nine months later. Pancreatic cancer is brutal. More time passes and I finally get a new record player. The bright cover of the Cream record catches my eye and I open the sleeve.\s\sA pressed penny for a state park near his home falls out. My dad passed away from cancer too. This just made me start sobbing. Much love to you.Goddamn these comment are making me sad. My mom may potentially have a cancer or some other disease (nonstop period bleeding that resulted in anemia) and I'm not prepared for that shit.Right time to leave this threadThat is so sweet. How nice to find a gift from Dad in heaven. /u/fuckswithducks What a lucky duck*evil rubber duck laughing*I did something like that for a girlfriend once. We’ve just gotten together and where deeply in love. I had to take a 30 days trip for work so I hid little love notes throughout her house so she could find during that period like inside a closed matchbox I knew she’d have to open or a pack of soap she was eventually going to use. She really liked it.Big if true Big if trueMy dad used to hide away quarters in film canisters . It took a while to find them all . It’s really nice to find a few bucks randomly and know it was dad who did it I'm really loving all of these stories of dads and grandpas who left things behind it's really touching. Keep 'em coming people!No! You are crying!I wanna do thisGuess the good luck wore off on ol pops eh?I did something similar for my ex when i was moving away i hid a fuck ton of notes on fond memories with her around her house. figured it was a good way to stay connected.

\s💜At my Dad's funeral my brother put a bunch of change in the pockets of Dad's suit.  Now every time I find random change in random places It reminds me of him.Gig 'em.\s\s(Shirt in profile pic)👍🏽So OK nice moment op\s\sOne question where does one walk where one would ALWAYS fine oneself finding rubber ducks??How do you find rubber ducks on your walks?\s\sI can't recall ever seeing a rubber duck while out and about.\s\sDid old dad go into people's back yards and steal children's toys? I don't get it.This is how I want to be remembered...Start finding ducks Same but I need some friends to remember me firstMe too We should use real ducks though. \s\sWow what's wrong with me?

I'm disappointed in myself now.I can think of one person who will definitely be remembered this wayThis is cute but where was this guy taking walks that he just *found* rubber ducks? Lol [A container full of them fell off a ship in 1992 and they washed up everywhere and taught oceanographers about currents.]( https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/what-can-28000-rubber-duckies-lost-at-sea-teach-us-about) Well it wasn't just any ordinary walk.  It was a wild goose chase!Probably around u/fuckswithducks 's houseSome places hold ""rubber duck races"" in creeks and streams.  Hundreds or thousands are released at once with numbers on them.  It's usually a charity raffle and the winner gets a prize.  \s\sExample:  \s\sSell 1000 ducks for $5 each for a charity run and the winner gets a $500 iPad.  ( = $4500 for the charity)Maybe he meant that the dad found them in stores.\s\sLike he walks past a second-hand shop and decides to go inside to look around and finds a rubber duck.This is cute until you realize he was stealing toys from the neighborhood children.  Man I can’t hardly go on a walk without finding a rubber duck. What are you talking about? Bathtubs?Maybe some guy dropped a rubber duck once then saw how happy he was to find one and think of it as good luck and stuff so he decided to leave more rubber ducks in the area at random to make him happyRubber ducks are weird man. My brother started renting a room with a terribly overgrown garden. We helped him get rid of the 3m tall brambles. In the process we found 17 rubber ducks in various colours (as well as an old engine block a 2 piece ladder and an overgrown barbeque)ikr! I assume instead that the post was written a bit wrong and meant to inply that he pre-hid the ducks and ""found"" them on walks or perhaps brought them long to ""hide"" while he walked as a sort of cheerful discovery for whomever may find them. If nothing else that's more likely and the OP just grew up so used to the dadjokes that they never thought about how wild it is that this man finds ducks everywhere.\s\sEither way it's wholesome sweet :DI hide the real baby duck I do get a different response though. As someone who’s latest thing is leaving rubber ducks everywhere I was genuinely curiousmy thoughts exactly.Rubber LakeThere’s one over by Fatal Fields...Did he walk by a rubber duck factory or something?

Granddaddy Anderson liked a sip now and then but my great-grandmother was a teetotaler.  So he'd frequent the local entrepreneurial distiller (dry county) and come home and hide his purchases pretty much anywhere.\s\sAfter he passed the grandkids (my dad's generation) would find Mason jars of moonshine **everywhere**.  When my grandparents passed and we finally started demolishing some of the old farm buildings 15 years ago we found one inside the hollow of a cinder block foundation.

I get it now.Your dad seems like he was a pretty awesome dude you were lucky to have him. Also oddly enough while unpacking boxes today I found a tiny rubber duck. I have no idea how it got into my stuff or where it came from.Oooo! Ducklings!Quack quack!He was Karl king of ducksRight in the feels...Where was he walking that he would find rubber ducks with any kind of regularity? I've been on many walks in my 42 years and have yet to find a rubber duck. It seems like something I should experience. I want to believe but I've never found a rubber duck on a walk.  Maybe I need to find better places?

She had a pretty good plan from the ISP but it was still very slow like slower than it should be even when you account for an ISP's general incompetence. So the ISP sent a technician out to investigate turns out my late father had mangled all of their cable cords before he died back in 1999 so that he could watch sports in his second story office. It was kind of a fun thing to learn about even though I'm sure he didn't *intend* to inconvenience my mother 15 years later.In the club?""Guess where I'm crying rn"" \s\sIn the club?Drake is that you?Bottle full of bubOn a motherfucking boat.I don't know why I'm crying in the club right now In the back seat cup holder?Oh no they're crying on the toilet for sure lol.Ain't no crying in the clubNice.Hey hey let the beat carry\sYour tears as well they fall baby Bitch I'm in da club *50 cent starts playing r/boneappleteaNext to a rubber duck?shiiiit you knowCan someone just link me to the fickswithducks response to this?Very cute!

He died almost 7 years agoThis guy and I are both part of the photography club at Texas a&m. He’s a pretty cool guy :)/r/madlads Hope they kept it thereMy grandpa used to hide $2 bills around the house when he came to visit and we were always scrambling to find them. I probably spent a few here or there as a little kid but most still live in a cigar box with some other treasures. He passed away when I was eleven - I found the “last” taped up in the back of my closet when I was packing for college. r/rubberducksDamn I miss my dad. It was ten years ago this May that he passed. Still read the notes he wrote to me.  He was a walking treasure as far as I'm concerned. It's funny how you don't realize it at the time. This reminds me of that old Mrs. Piggle Wiggle story. She was a widow whose incredibly rich husband die but he stashed his riches in little spots around the house for her. She always living by modest means didn’t have any trouble living off of what she occasionally found but eventually it began to run out. She started to worry. I forget exactly how but some children she had taken in helped her to find the final “treasure”—enough to last her the rest of her life and a letter from her husband.This happened to me on a train from Buffalo to NYC. The girl sitting next to me was peeking over so I just said hi. We wound up watching all of season 3 of Game of Thrones together Red Wedding and all. I guess that the train goes on like 10kmh?I tried to do this on my last flight for the lady sitting next to me but Netflix wouldn't run the subtitles properly!I saw this tweet here the other day but it was 2 girls in a lecture hall.Until he gets to Scotts Tots and doesn't skip it. ""You...Monster!!!""every human shares this sort of secret bond that nobody should be allowed to be bored I love the Yeontan pic of the other replyWas searching for this comment lmao hey I just noticed that as well:DLast year I was on a train and the guy sitting next to me noticing that I am watching his movie gave me one of his earphones. We couldn't even speak as it was in China and I don't speak mandarin. The most wholesome thing that happened to me there.I did that once on a 6 hour bus bus ride. The guy next to me didn't have anything to do and kept looking at my screen while I was watching movies on my laptop. I felt really bad that I had headphones not ear buds so I couldn't share with him thought the least I could do is turn on the subtitles. First thing he says to me next stop is ""Thank you for the subtitles.""Hello its me\sThe guyI sat behind a 12 year old boy who kept pausing soul surfer right when the shark bit her arm off Did it is sub the shark going ""OM NOM NOM?""Spoiler alert bruhThat sadistic fuck[deleted][deleted]Did you get to see your grandmother?❤️This is so incredibly sweet. Thank you for sharing. Saw this years ago but it was Greys Anatomy and in a college lecture.  I turned on my subs for Parks and Rec when I noticed the guy next to me watching it. I really wanted to offer him an ear phone but I didn’t want him to know I noticed.r/humansbeingbrosOw shit it's my reddit b day[deleted]>This was a United flight - so not a whole lot of entertainment options. \s\sFor much the same reason you won't catch a football game at a cockfighting ring. No need to provide entertainment when row 12 has a flight officer vs a doctor.Apologies for the strange question but would you have any advice for someone going on a long flight for the first time?\s\sI'm traveling to New Zealand in a few months and I'm pretty nervous/anxious about how to deal with being in the air for 13+ hours (I *reeeeally* don't like flying). \s\sAny info or advice you would be willing to lend would be HUGELY appreciated and thank you so much for taking the time to read my request!!\s\s\sEDIT: Holy cow!! Thank you all SO much for taking the time to write me and offer advice and kind words of encouragement/ reassurance! I'm honestly blown away (and so incredibly grateful) for all of the kindness I have received! What? I thought there was a very decent selection of movies on United's entertainment systemI mean I just think this is about one of the nicest things you could do on public transport and mad respect to these people - it'd be so easy and so common for someone to get annoyed that ""SOMEONE ELSE"" is ""using"" their property etc etc so I love these stories so much and will do the same when I'm in public :)I was on a Frontier flight with my kids and husband. I sat between one of my kids and some random guy. He was unprepared for the complete lack of services. I offered him some food when I was getting stuff out for the fam and you should have seen this man's face. He looked like he was going to cry with joy when I handed him his sad little plate of hard boiled egg Apple baby carrots and wheat thins. He kept raving about the apple like it was some real gourmet shit. Lol.  He basically fell all over himself getting out of the seat when we needed the bathroom and offered to help carry our bags off the plane. It's funny how such a miniscule thing can have such a big effect on someone. I love people sometimes.What does Waffle Stomp mean to you? I know what it means to me.I hope they didn't stuff your laptop in the compartment with no air to breatheI would have his babies yada yada yada my wife left me.I thought you were going to say you bought him a drink :(There's a special place in heaven for people like this <=3Once was on a flight from LA to NY and was in the window seat next to a mom and her teenage son who was sitting next to me in the middle seat.  This was back in the day of portable DVD players and he was watching Old School.  It was fresh on DVD and although I had already seen it a few times I was watching in my seat and laughing in hysterics.  He offered me to share his headphones and we ended up dying laughing together for the rest of the flight.  Was pretty cool....When I was younger me and my dad weren’t able to get seats together on a train. I had severe anxiety and was in the midst of a breakdown when the guy I had to sit next to turned to me and said:\s\s“Have you seen How To Train Your Dragon? I hear it’s a good movie.”\s\sAnd he proceeded to get his laptop out of his bag turn it towards me and play the movie. I still haven’t forgotten that. That movie came out ** ~~10~~ 8 fucking years ago.**\s\sFuck I feel old.\s\sEdit: numbers are hella dumb just as I am apparently.This is really sweet but why didn’t he just swap seats with your dad so you could sit with him?I would be scared but would thank the person a fucking lot if I were in this situation. I mean I have anxiety as well so... :PAnd then he touched you....?Was watching Reign on a flight and realized that the women behind me were watching as well when they gasped as a character was suddenly killed. Turned on the subtitles for them and we watched two more episodes together. Imazighen!!That's why I always turn subtitles on when I'm watching porn in a planeThis is how Jojo's Bizarre Adventure started y'know?this is a modern day way of expressing “my spirit recognizes yours” \s\slet’s enjoy this experience together. I was sitting on the train the seats were arranged for groups of four people so two rows (with two seats) facing each other. There were 3 people sitting there me and a random guy watching scrubs on his laptop on one side and a old lady on the other side. The guy noticed me watching. I Hoped he would turn on subtitles but he actually switched sided and set to the old lady so then I was staring at the backside of a laptop. I was so puzzled i had to leave the train cabin.When I was in 4th or 5th grade this guy on the plane next to me had a portable DVD player and was watching Blade I think. He turned the subtitles on for me it was the first R movie I ever watched and it was awesome. This is a little much no? I told Chantal that I'd die for her already. She also confirmed it with me. That was nice. I forgot to tell Olivia and Rachel that I'd die for them too. They are mostly because of all the drugs and trips spent together.The Office brings people together! People like this make the world a better placeR/dundermifflanI remember watching the other guys on this guys laptop he was sat down on a packed train and I was standing. As soon as his seat was available he looked around offered the seat to me and gave me one of his earphones. True heroes are out there in the wilderness.This makes me happy. There is hope for humanity. I probably won’t get many upvotes since this post is a bit old but on a flight from Stockholm to LAX I noticed a guy that was super bored across the aisle and he didn’t have a credit card to buy anything. I then bought him some candy and headphones. I hope he enjoyed his trip. [removed]r/DunderMifflin Hell. Yes.Psssh. People still need subtitles to follow what’s happening at any given moment of The Office?I put The Office as my background when I sleep. Just hearing it while my eyes are closed is almost the same as watching it. I can imagine every little detail. Only casuals.Pfttt amateurs. I’m on my 3rd listen and sometimes I’ll just listen to The Office whole doing something. I too can imagine the whole scene.On a flight my mom and I didn't feel like shelling out for headphones turned out we didn't need them to know what was going on during the Office. Never watched anything besides the first episode so subtitles would help me realize it was the office and i could do something else entirely :)but did he get the pussy?Don't drink carbonated beverages before or during your flight and don't drink caffeinated beverages either such as coffee. Stay away from salty snacks and food due to water retention. Water is your best friend as is orange juice!\s\sIf you're anxious about flying get a tranquilizer! Give it a test run at home... they're great for just chilling and sleeping. I'd rather sleep on a flight than stay awake. Earphones neck pillow shoes that are easy to take off. \s\sDress nicely this isn't camping.Why not have carbonated beverages or caffeine? [deleted]It's okay I believe you.I remember being in class and in front of me someone was watching Avatar and she noticed me watching. She tilted the her ipad and turned on subs so I could watch with her. Blesses be on her soul.Good person. During one of my classes in college the same guy would always seat in one of the first row of the auditorium and watch the latest episodes of popular shows right after they aired. We hated him. Oof am I the only one who D O E S N T like the office?YesI DECLARE BANKRUPTCY I always get slaughtered for saying that the Office wasn’t as great as people hype it to be. I don’t see the humor a bit cringy to meThat's creepy as fuck. I would take you photo and start planning my getaway.8 comments? Well for OP it was silent so we should observe silence. Just last night I started randomly watching an office episode for the first time since it’s been off tv prime time. I forgot how absolutely incredible it was. I’m starting from episode 1 and going through all of them. The joy will be endless. My wife and I began watching it back in December or January. We have one episode left. I really don't know what to do after tomorrow. I guess just start all over. We watched parks and rec before the office and it was great too. I remember the 2000s watching the office every night with my roommate. Never finished it though. It's great to return to it. It has really inspired me to look for a better job. Sounds crazy but it really has inspired me.I’m rewatching now and am at the Rabies race. I told a friend that rewatching it is like hugging an old friend. Watching it for the first time and I keep on trying to stifle my laughter on public transport ripYou guys should head over to r/dundermifflin My husband and I just started watching it tonight we've seen some episodes but not all we just finished watching Brun Notice and Charmed also.My girlfriend and I watch every episode about once a year all the way through. Best idea ever. Friend zoned.I do this when I'm watching porn in the library why didn't she just tell him then and there how much she appreciated it..Would distract them all from watchingI wouldn’t have just in case they didn’t turn subtitles on for me. Imagine that?? So awkward.hope it was the original ‘the office’I haven't seen the UK version yet but if you're implying that the US version was bad in any way then you're wrongI watched Bollywood films with the gentleman I was sat next to on my flight to Bangalore. I was knocked out for a good amount of time. Missed the first meal. the second meal I was still asleep. He made sure to have the flight attendant get me a meal. He woke me up shortly after (I was sleeping quite a while) so it didn't get too cold. It was really nice of him to think about a stranger. I don't know his name he didn't speak great English but he was one of the nicest people i've met. I liked the Dancing parts of Bollywood films.My trick? Subtitles are always on. I always have subtitles on too... Man I hope the people behind like watching history documentaries! :D I couldn’t watch anything with subtitles until my college roommate watched legitimately everything with subtitles. Got used to it real quick That's what she saidEver since I started watching anime it's kinda stuck with me. Plus it's super great when shows decide to go from loud action scenes to quite dialog. Don't have to frantically rewind or turn it up then down.Happened to me on a plane. Guy next to me was watching Frasier and saw me watching. Then turned on his subtitles... made the flight a little less terrible :') Hello!
