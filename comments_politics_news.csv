0,AmericanPolitics,neoliberal,333,"\>shocked pikachu face.pngWhile I'm sure this article has good research it disagrees with my priors so is therefore false.Water is also wet.Not surprising since the primary obstacles to faster growth are regulatory capture domination of policy making by special interests and rent seekers and structural challenges due to demographics and social problems.*GASP* REALLY?! Who would’ve thought letting poor people die while catering to the rich would hurt poor people?This is only “controversial“ because one party backed by the likes of Charles Koch and Paul Singer have an interest it pretending that it is.There's normative reasons imo to oppose high levels of taxation regardless of  whether it falls on an unpopular group of people or not. I understand  that's not the point of the study and maybe not even the point of  politics but I do think it's worth at least mentioning.Wherefrom do these normative reasons for opposing high tax for the rich stem? Pretty sure it isn't from judeo-christian values.Yeah no shit.Nothing but Voodoo Economics.Reagan was wrong. Bush was right!Unfortunately it might not matter because you've always been able to cite the last tax cuts to say ""these tax cuts you're putting forth aren't going to be worth it.""http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf\s\spaperGuessing this is because Twitter leftists love to try to ratio conservative tweets. If there's ever a right leaning hashtag trending clicking into it will reveal mostly people clowning on it.\s\sTwitter counts that counts as engagement and elevates the original tweet.This is really only something that's a few years old and would not explain the data.Not for me. That's because of the location you live in. I live in a red state and get bombarded with republicans. It makes social media almost impossible to use. I search Biden and get 30 tweets calling him a pedofile or a fake presidentThe title is a little misleading but the study is saying the exact opposite of what you’re suggesting.\s\s“ Twitter has admitted it amplifies more tweets from rightwing politicians and news outlets than content from leftwing sources.”Is there a similar research for reddit?Reddit does not really use an algorithm you mostly choose your own content by choosing subredditsIs Rose Twitter just my bubble then?>rose twitter\s\s#HOLY FUCK GO OUTSIDE\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/neoliberal) if you have any questions or concerns.*Direct [link to the study](https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/blog-twitter/official/en_us/company/2021/rml/Algorithmic-Amplification-of-Politics-on-Twitter.pdf) done in collaboration with outside researchers. Some data is published too\s\sInterestingly they lean on AdFontes ( of MediaBiasChart fame ) and AllSides as rating agencies for what constitutes left/center/rightJust like everything they complain about the whole “Twitter is biased against conservatives” narrative was projection all along.I thought Vijaya Gadde said this was completely false?Go after their ad revenue.I'm not getting burned by Rolling Stone again just because this story agrees with my priors. I don't trust Rolling Stone lmaoFor me it's not so much that it's the Rolling Stone. It's more that these types of people have shown themselves to be massively ego-centric such that it's plausible that they could be embellishing their connections with Congress just to make themselves look important. Or they could be using this as a bargaining chip with investigators.\s\sOn the other hand their claims do line up with other pieces of evidence like the suspicious ""guided tours"" and the seemingly directed Tweets on/around Jan 6 by members of Congress. I think it's reasonably established that there was coordination between Republican officials and the insurrectionists the question is just to what degree.\s\sEdit: I guess it's worth considering that all of this could be true at the same time lol.At least the photo matches the actual event this time. Progress!I have this vague sense that Rolling Stone is untrustworthy but can't remember exactly why. Which incident(s) are you referring to?[deleted]Maybe Trump will get impeached a third timeHat trickWouldn't have been necessary if they actually allowed a proper investigation...You know what they say - three strikes and yooooooooouuuuuuuu're still one of the most likely people on earth to win the 2024 election!Say it with me now ""Lock them up!""\s\sIt's insane to me that this isn't bigger news. Members of Congress actively conspired to commit a coup and it's crickets out there.Didn't this news just come out a few hours ago due to the House investigation?The Fourth Estate is too busy writing about their Twitter beefsNot really. They certainly set the *stage* for something that could become a coup but (as far as we can tell) they didn't have actual plans for violence or overthrow.They planned a legal protest. We knew this already because politicians spoke at it and they set up a stage and sound system and got permission. It's a non story.Whether it's Republicans congresspeople collaborating in an attempted coup or Democrats trying to ""lock up"" those congresspeople both sides have demonstrated a lack of respect for democracy.So the list so far includes the following Congressmen\s\s• Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)\s\s• Paul Gosar (R-AZ)\s\s• Lauren Boebert (R-CO)\s\s• Mo Brooks (R-AL)\s\s• Madison Cawthorn (R-NC)\s\s• Andy Biggs (R-AZ)\s\s• Louie Gohmert (R-TX)\s\sI may have some major disagreements with some of the left-wing congress members but they at least respect our institution unlike these individuals listed above. They need to be expelled from Congress at the very least. However with the current structure that’s unlikely so investigations and arrests need to be conducted instead. \s\sIf you happen to live in one of the district they represent then please if nothing else vote them out during the midterms next year.\s\sEDIT: This article does have a questionable source so apologies for jumping the gun however I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the above mentioned reps actively supported the insurrection at the very least.Marjorie Taylor Greene's distict is R+50.\sLauren Boebert's district is getting redrawn to be even safer for her by a Democratic-run commission.\s\sThese people aren't getting voted out ever. I could even see at least one of them being House Speaker in a decade or so due to their being as insulated and safe in their seats as Pelosi is in her San Francisco district.This comment is excessive partisanship /s[deleted]Color me shocked at that list /sWere any of these representatives also on the GOP-proposed list for the Jan. 6 commission?Expel them for what? Helping to organize a protest isn't illegal. I'd like to see these clowns get expelled from congress as much as anybody but unless there's evidence that they knew about the storming of the building beforehand they don't seem to have done anything to warrant it.Party of treason?!Is there any information about this from a credible news source?WaPoIs rolling stone not credible?>“Our impression was that it was a done deal” the organizer says “that he’d spoken to the president about it in the Oval … in a meeting about pardons and that our names came up. They were working on submitting the paperwork and getting members of the House Freedom Caucus to sign on as a show of support.” \s\s>The organizer claims the pair received “several assurances” about the “blanket pardon” from Gosar.\s\s>“I was just going over the list of pardons and we just wanted to tell you guys how much we appreciate all the hard work you’ve been doing” Gosar said according to the organizer.\s\sbruhIf these people are surprised that the pardons didn't actually happen they probably should have considered that possibility before engaging with the actual dumbest members of Congress.This should be the main headline of every news outlet tomorrow and I almost guarantee it won't be.I was telling my brother that RS published this tonight because they want it to dominate the news cycle tomorrow but that it probably won't and it probably sadly doesn't matter if it did.Even if it was I have absolutely zero confidence the public will believe it. Every damn voter in the country basically has their mind made up about what they want to believe regardless of any facts. We're in the post-truth era.It's not really that notable. Trump spoke at the event it makes sense they would have met with Meadows. \s\sAnd some random congressperson made vague hints that he could influence Trump to pardon one of the organizers for some unreleated investigation he was the subject of. There have been a lot of stories about people with no real authority peddling pardons.Joe Biden could hold an emergency conference with the media and make it a headline. He is the president of the United States and considering the last president couldn't stay the fuck out of the media it's baffling how little presence Biden has had. \s\sBut I guess the fillibuster and Sinema and Manchin are preventing him from doing that...Going to need more than Rolling Stone though. I still remember Rolling Stone running literally a fanfic regarding the UVA rape culture.This story just isn't that notable. They met with Meadows and some congresspeople before the event? Trump and other spoke there so it's not surprising that they would involve Meadows in Trump's plans for the day.\s\sThe pardon promise was just some random congressperson making vague promises to pardon one of the organizers because they're involved in some other investigation. The headline makes it sound like they offered to pardon all the insurrectionists which isn't what the article actually says.This should be higher up. Let's not become the pariah that r/politics became during the Russia investigationRollingstone has a habit of publishing highly sensational stories that end up being completely false. \s\sI’ll take this story with a grain of salt until a more credible publication picks up the story. If it is true I’ve no doubt that will be soon.Stan for Marjorie Taylor Greene all you want to. I'm pretty sure this is something everyone saw coming.Imprison Lauren Boebert[deleted]The fact that this story confirmation of a coordinated attack **with inside help** on the United States doesn't immediately go to national headlines speaks volumes as to just how fucked we really areAnd what exactly are you going to do if Democrats do nothing?\s\sNot vote Democrat? You have no power to hold them accountable.This was a coup.They're sure as fuck gonna try again in 2024 and if they take congress they'll probably pull it off this time. Real stable democracy we got here.Well it failed. \s\sBut yes it was an attempted coup.Literally a third world country.\s\sedit: So do the people downvoting think this is a normal thing that happens in developed countries or...?Congressional democrats preference for peace over justice means that nothing will come of this and it will happen again.At this point it’s clear that Trump was planning a coup and had a desire to establish a dictatorship. He needs to be tried for treason.I dont understand how this is a new development. The stop the steal rally was organized by the trump campaign as far as I know its not ilegal for staff members or congressmen to help orgnaise rallies.  The storming of the capitol is obviously ilegal but this article just says that there were staffers planning the rally which occured in the white house not that they were planning the storming. I assumed this to be true already as trump himself repeatedly advertised the rally prior to the event.If what they assert is true then the part about pardons is pretty revealing. As you said it's not illegal to plan rallies yet pardons were discussed. Why would they need to talk about blanket pardons if everything they intended to do was above board? Certainly implies they knew they were planning to do illegal things with the express consent of the administration.\s\sI'll wait until more reporting comes out as Rolling Stone has been shoddy in the past but the implications of these allegations are very bad.> “A whole host of people let this go a totally different way” the senior Republican staffer says. “They fucked it up for a lot of people who were planning to present evidence on the House floor. We were pissed off at everything that happened .”\s\sWell see the problem with that plan is they never had any evidence. Raiding the capitol didn't stop them from presenting their """"""evidence"""""" it was just shit evidence and they were actually hoping the riot would let them overturn the election.\s\sA lot of this has some plausible deniability (""Oh we were just having a little protest it all just got out of hand"" type stuff) but the pardon bits should make it clear people were trying to make it go sideways.\s\s> And Gosar who has been one of the most prominent defenders of the Jan. 6 rioters allegedly took things a step further. Both sources say he dangled the possibility of a “blanket pardon” in an unrelated ongoing investigation to encourage them to plan the protests.Nothing will happenUntil it does.I'm waiting for a better news source to carry this. Members of Congress meeting with protest organizers isn't particularly spicy. Members of Congress promising protesters pardons for criminal activities is but by the same token it is a more extravagant claim and Rolling Stone has a history of picking up extravagant claims and running with them.The article doesn't say they promised protestors pardons. It says Congressman Gosar hinted he could get a pardon for one of the organizers for an unrelated investigation he was the subject of.I’m going to call bullshit on this story. Massive conspiracy? Kept totally secret by a bunch of bozos for nearly a year after the event? Reported in Rolling Stone which has a history of shoddy journalism in an article composed entirely of allegations? Either this never happened or it’s a fish story.Just a note nowhere in the article does it say that the violence/coup-y part of 1/6 was a part of the meetings.Yeah this isn't shocking news at all. The organizers met with Meadows who's the person in charge of Trump's schedule and a bunch of congresspeople and/or their staff members. Not shocking since Trump and some congresspeople attended or spoke at the event.\s\sSome congressperson made vague promises that never materialized of ""the possibility of a “blanket pardon” in an unrelated ongoing investigation"". Fucked up yes but there's been a lot of stories about people with no real influence peddling pardons.Good they'll have to keep saying the violence part was a terrible thing.Honestly we headed for 1930s Japan where people are gonna try to coup the government and the government is gonna give them slaps on the wrist in terms of punishmentOr Germany or Italy from around the same time.\s\sSo if history is any guide here what will happen next is the moderates will work their ass off to try and bring the radicals into the fold and defang them because Manchin and Sinema (among others) will prefer to work with the authoritarian coup plotters to box out ""The Left"".\s\sBecause we know how well that worked out.If there's a shred of legitimacy in this country these traitors need to be punished to the fullest extent of the law. And they certainly shouldn't be in fucking congress!And this guy gets 44 months in federal prison:\s\shttps://twitter.com/theintercept/status/1452097061072035843\s\sHis biggest crime? ""The threat of kidnapping charge stemmed from a feverish public Facebook post in which Baker put out a general call for anti-racists and anti-fascists to encircle the state Capitol should far-right groups attack it “on or around inauguration day” and “trap” right-wingers inside with cops. In the very next sentence though he wrote “we will drive them out of Tallahassee with every caliber available!” The right wing militiae were thus to be trapped in and driven out at once on an unspecified day by an unnamed collaboration of counterprotesters.""\s\sJan 6th traitors who not only posted worse but then went to and entered the capitol are getting probation.\s\sThis country is pretty fucked.I bet they are dumb and arrogant enough to leave a paper trailI am skeptical of anonymous sources here. Everyone remover the Russia investigation. We should remain cautious because if this is true that would constitute the second largest betrayal by active members of Congress in the history of the Republic.>Despite their remaining affinity for Trump and their questions about the vote both sources say they were motivated to come forward because of their concerns about how the pro-Trump protests against the election ultimately resulted in the violent attack on the Capitol. Of course with their other legal issues and the House investigation both of these sources have clear motivation to cooperate with investigators and turn on their former allies. And both of their accounts paint them in a decidedly favorable light compared with their former allies. \s“The reason I’m talking to the committee and the reason it’s so important is that — despite Republicans refusing to participate … this commission’s all we got as far as being able to uncover the truth about what happened at the Capitol that day” the organizer says. “It’s clear that a lot of bad actors set out to cause chaos. … They made us all look like shit.” \s\s\sSo it's damned clear from the article the ""planning"" was for the rally which was legal and there's zero connection to the actual violence except a vague reference by a staffer that there were discussions about a ""blanket pardon.""  ""What would the pardon be for?""  Maybe [obstructing pedestrian traffic?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/10/20/alyssa-milano-arrested-white-house-while-advocating-freedom-vote-act/6105731001/)These characters are why I support keeping Gitmo open.LMAO wtfwe sharing conspiracy theories now?> “No one cares about Jan. 6 when gas prices are skyrocketing grocery store shelves are empty unemployment is skyrocketing businesses are going bankrupt our border is being invaded children are forced to wear masks vaccine mandates are getting workers fired and 13 members of our military are murdered by the Taliban and Americans are left stranded in Afghanistan” Dyer wrote.\s\sYeah… culture war bullshit aside most people just don’t really care about January 6. Only the nichest of the most terminally online liberals do. The public never cared about it beyond the day that it actually happened cause they were like “well the election was certified anyway so there’s not really a problem” at best and “well the liberals in Congress like Pramila Jayapal and Maxine Waters pretty much tried to do the same thing to Trump in 2017 and Barbara Boxer did it to Bush in 2001 so… meh…” at worst.\s\sI said it when it happened but Dems are going to exclusively run on Jan. 6 and domestic terrorism fearmongering due to having zero permanent accomplishments to campaign on and then are going to have surprised Pikachu faces when they lose both majorities and Joe Biden begins having to defend himself from impeachment inquiries during the next Congressional Term.>Instead he asked me what I thought Hillary’s chances were. The polls were unanimous in her winning but what he wanted to know was my own assessment?\s\s>I had to be frank with him. I did not trust the polls I said.\s\sThis sounds like rank hindsight bias right?

I mean anyone could see what a bad candidate Hillary was. We just thought Trump was going to be worse (and he was of course but his voters lived in the right states). \s\sPeople are downvoting like it's not true. She had the 2nd worst favorability of any candidate since they started doing favorability polls. She's a swell lady and would've been a good ~~candidate~~ edit: president but she was obviously a bad candidate. She lost to Donald Trump. >Other Discussions (63)\s\sWew lad And they say *we're* the shills. I wonder who the people are who upvoted this in /r/neoliberal.Impressive time-lapse on Donna Brazile’s conscience here. Her confession about the corruption she witnessed within the DNC occurs about a year and a half after the fact 10 months into Trump’s presidency and 5 days before her new book comes out. How amazingly brave of her.> Instead he asked me what I thought Hillary’s chances were. The polls were unanimous in her winning but what he wanted to know was my own assessment?\s> \s> I had to be frank with him. I did not trust the polls I said.\s\scringe.At this point I really believe that Donna's goal for whatever reason is to do as much damage to the Democratic party as possible. I dare you guys to look in the Other Discussions tabWorth it for the title in Dramano donna what is you doingtelling the truth for onceI honestly don't want to read this (will probably end up doing it some day anyway) so I want to ask: is there any evidence of *illegal* activity in this or is it just further questionable skulduggery?> I had tried to search out any other evidence of internal corruption that would show that the DNC was rigging the system to throw the primary to Hillary but I could not find any in party affairs or among the staff. I had gone department by department investigating individual conduct for evidence of skewed decisions and I was happy to see that I had found none. Then I found this agreement.\s\s> The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal but it sure looked unethical.  If the fight had been fair one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. \s\s\s\sBasically no rigging except for this joint fundraising agreement - WHICH ARE FUCKING COMMONPLACE AMONG NATIONAL PARTIES. SANDERS (PSUV - Vermont) SET ONE UP AS WELL.\s\sThe point about ""control of the party"" is also meaningless. By the time Donna took control in late July the voters *had* decided. \s\sI can link you to better E_S_S posts if you want. But short answer not even questionable skullduggery.It's as much a ""secret take over"" of the DNC as the TARP fund was a ""secret take over"" of banks.[deleted]No. \s\sHillary came in with her pantsuit freshly pressed and with money to blow and Donna had to step aside for running the organization she was in charge of into the fucking dirt Lol Clinton is the boogeyman of the far left and far right. It’s so damn stupid. She's the boogeyman of the *center* left and *center* right somehow.Personally I'm getting ready for 4 more years of trump now.she is not the boogeyman of the far left. The far left is nothing compared the far right. \s\sI just wish everyone could just say ""Clinton was a turd sandwich and can we please stop talking about her?""I don't see why this is all that big news. We knew about this before didn't we? \s\shttps://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/dnc-democratic-committee-hillary-clinton-fundraising-agreement-2016-121813\s\sState parties set the rules for primaries not the DNC. The DNC is a glorified fundraising arm and it couldn't even do that properly. HFA assumed their debt and bailed them out. \s\sIndividuals candidates also raise their own money that's where the bulk of it comes from. The DNC the DCCC the DSCC and the DGA contribute supplementary money advertising (sometimes) and manpower. \s\sHere's a breakdown of the money used from HVF. \s\shttps://www.opensecrets.org/jfc/summary.php?id=C00586537\s\sEvery state party got around $3 million and considering it is money Hillary and her campaign raised I don't see the problem here. Everyone got a good cut and while the majority of it went to the Presidential election that's not unexpected. \s\sPolitico took an excerpt from a book written by a person who wants to dodge blame and responsibility gave it a click-baity headline and presented that excerpt without any context. \s\sPeople are reading far too much into this. None of this is new information the source and the intentions of that source are questionable and if you look at the plain facts nothing here is all that strange. In shocking news Party prefers candidate who has been giving them money for years than one who joined just to run a campaign. S-H-O-C-K-I-N-G. I like Bernie in fact i support most of his ideas to an extent but his supporters are as culty as Trumps sometimes when it comes to certain things. Maybe this is just so they can feel better that they threw away votes going for a shitty third party alternative. This part is new and the most worrying part of it:\s\s> The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC Hillary would control the party’s finances strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing budgeting data analytics and mailings.\s\sIf the Clinton campaign had that much control and access since August 2015 the DNC blatantly played favorites through the entire primary while claiming to be neutral.is/ought fallacy.\s\sSo even though the people voting rejected Clinton a sane stable coherent professional educated experienced candidate it's all fine because the rules weren't broken. OMG TRUMP WON!! stop trying to say the status quo is fine. The DNC has taken a huge reputational hit from this whole fiasco. They need to change their internal structure so Top democrats don't keep coming out and[ saying the system was rigged](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/02/politics/elizabeth-warren-dnc-rigged/index.html). WTF I love Hillary now \s\sBTW it’s the secret take over that was widely reported on in 2015 and that BeRNie also participated in. Do these people fail to understand that Hillary won by four million votes and that there is nothing showing these votes were tampered with or voters were otherwise 'forced' to vote for her? Turns out that if you run as an independent in a Democratic primary the voters just aren't that in to you. . . . secret?Donna Brazile is an opportunistic hack and part of the long-standing problem with the DNC. Listen to any interview she's ever done and tell me that she says something insightful. Ironic that such a career talking-head hot-air blower like her makes this attack and we all take it so seriously.\s\sDonna Brazile is part of the corrupt buy-my-book/contribution/talking-tour-based DNC that needs to be dismantled in order to have a true liberal party.\s\sOr we can just continue following hacks and fetishizing Bernie Sanders' ridiculous long-outdated economic policies. Let's give it one more try. /s\s\s She makes the money\s\sShe makes the rules. Ignore all the personal crusading of Donna Brazile and just look at these passages:  \s\s> Individuals who had maxed out their $2700 contribution limit to the campaign could write an additional check for $353400 to the Hillary Victory Fund—that figure represented $10000 to each of the 32 states’ parties who were part of the Victory Fund agreement—$320000—and $33400 to the DNC. The money would be deposited in the states first and transferred to the DNC shortly after that. Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.  \s\s.\s\s> Yet the states kept less than half of 1 percent of the $82 million they had amassed from the extravagant fund-raisers Hillary’s campaign was holding just as Gary had described to me when he and I talked in August.  \s\s.\s\s> The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC Hillary would control the party’s finances strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing budgeting data analytics and mailings.Not completely excusing this but the states got money. The article make it sound like peanuts \s\shttps://www.opensecrets.org/jfc/summary.php?id=C00586537\s\s$2-3 million to a local party is a shitload of money. > Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.\s\sTHIS IS EXACTLY HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO WORK HOLY SHIT.\s\sBattleground states get first priority. The presidential candidate gets second priority. Non presidential non battle ground state candidates get last priority. What the hell is wrong with that???It's extra upsetting because we were within striking distance of retaking the Senate (and padding our margins against the horrible 2018 map).\s\sFlipping Pennsylvania Wisconsin and North Carolina would have been a super big fucking deal.  And while we can all argue over whether these campaigns were ""winnable"" $82M is a buncha-lotta-money.  Certainly it wouldn't have hurt chances to expand campaign staffs in these states rather than plowing everything into a Hillary Campaign and hoping her name brand alone could carry the entire party.[deleted]I'm still waiting for the article by Reince Preibus where he exposes the Trump takeover of the RNC.Wasn't Donna Brazile caught colluding with the Clinton campaign by sending questions before CNN's town hall? Tad Divine received the exact same questions and the Bernie campaign confirmed as much.It was like a question about the Flint water crisis at the Flint debate. Oh my. Hillary would have never prepped for that question without the tip-off.Yes that was prior to her joining the DNC and finding all of this. Separate issue and if you truly didn't know then there's your answer but if you did then you're trying to discredit this piece with some whataboutism. It's irrelevant on this post.[yes](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/donna-brazile-finally-admits-she-shared-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign/article/2617742)Alright guys - if you want to be evidence-based this is a pill you're going to have to swallow. The primary wasn't rigged but this is unquestionable evidence of corruption in the DNC.[deleted]Why is this unquestionable? Bernie was offered the same deal.I don't know about that. The DNC was in a huge amount of debt and unable to raise funds on their own. Hillary paid off the debt and helped fundraise for them.\s\sBernie also wasn't interested in DNC funds or his own Bernie Victory Fund which only raised $1000. He relied on small donations totally and said they weren't interested in using the Victory Fund if they won the primary.\s\sThe only thing this hurts is the perception and non competitive states which didn't keep their money - swing States kept their money.Have fun losing Democrats. God what a stupid party sometimes\s\sWorst thing this is after corbyn lost.We followed the UK down the path of nationalism in 2016 so hey why not have our own Corbynite smackdown in 2020.\s\sRelentless online propaganda works.(Correct me if I’m wrong) but the main reason Corbyn lost was that Brexit split his Coalition. Does Bernie have a similar issue besides just general Socialism. Also I think it’s just as valid to look across the Southern Border to Mexico and the election of AMLO when trying to predict what will happen in the U.S.UK demographics and U.S. demographics are different. Quit comparing the political situation of these two countries moron.Fans of bad sports teams also think their team can win more than it will. This is not unique to Bernie and is just a motivated reasoning thing.As a life long Democrat and Minnesota Vikings fan can fucking confirm!72% of democratic voters are dumb and wrongThis party is just throwing itself into the meat grinder.72% of democratic voters are smart. Neoliberals who think Bernie will lose are dumb.If all 72% of these democrats did vote....then?We have to change this. I trust Bloomberg to tank his polling with a giant negative campaign targeted at Sanders post-debate.the GOP is a mistakeName and shame the cowardsThe only positive about Trump is that he's accelerating the GOP's death spiral.See that's what I'd love to think too but there's no indication that the GOP is dying. It's been getting slowly radicalized since the 70s and people are always saying ""this has to stop or backfire at some point"" but it never has yet.\s\sThe most likely outcome right now is that Trumpism (cult-like hatred for anything liberal and support for whoever they see as their leader) simply continues to be the norm for the next 50 years.I think she actually has a pretty good shot mainly because Trump is laser focused on destroying Kemp currently.Yes one of his few good qualities.  He'll happily train friendly fire on any Republican who hasn't guzzled their full dose of Kool-aid.Trump is already publicly [shitting](https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1466194323494555650?t=qIL7S59eNuVg--UN-U89yQ&s=19) on him so you may have a point.Hopefully she will also help enough down ballot to give Warnock a second term.Agreed. And because this is a statewide race the redistricting nonsense happening in red states across the country (including Georgia) don't matter.    \s\s\sI do fear voting restrictions and efforts to close polling places in heavily democratic districts is going to make this an unfair fight — but if anyone can succeed despite these barriers it's Stacey Abrams.Call me too optimistic but I think she has a pretty good shot at this one. I know it’s a “republican year” or whatever but Dems have been continuously flipping munincipal seats even as recently as a day ago (flipped like 7 in runoff elections). Combine this with how good Abrams has been at getting out the vote it is well possible for her to win (not to mention how much trump **hates** kemp if he survives a primary Trumpers will still possibly be sour on him)In recent years I've discovered that I have all the political prediction prowess of a triggered Twitter tankie; I have no idea how her campaign will go but godspeed.  Abrams is a firebrand but more importantly than that she's a firewall anyone who keeps a Republican out of office is a good deal. \s \sAlmost everything else < WinningThe big problem nationwide for Democrats in 2022 will be matching Republican enthusiasm to vote against Biden.  Stacey has created a huge nationwide following since 2018 and is one of the rare politicians that gets people *excited* to vote for them.  If she can get a huge minority turnout while also already having Warnock on the ballot I can’t see how 2022 won’t be another blue year in Georgia.That’s a great point. Stacey gets people *excited*. \s\sBefore the lockdown days she came to a local Democratic Party event in Phoenix (Arizona is purple now but it felt redder then) and people were lining up to take pictures with her and shake her hand. I don’t remember what the meeting was even about but the crowd was cheering and giving standing ovations the entire time. The enthusiasm was incredible. It’s rare to see a candidate who can do that to people.\s\sEdit: She wasn’t even running for anything at the time and she was from the opposite side of the country! She just does something to peopleMy big fear is you actually need Trump being an active bull in china shop to motivate people to vote... period and that the motivation to vote blue in any other scenario has already been thoroughly diminished by efforts of the disgruntled left. \s\sBecause Republicans? They're chomping at the bit all the time now that they're sufficiently deranged.beto gets me excited over here in Texas though I fear that he gets Republicans excited too :(Stacey might get the *wrong people* excited. Warren and KHive types that ensconce the campaign in a bubble where they can do no wrong everything is someone else’s fault and drive their candidate to say stupid things.It's interesting. Municipal results here in GA have seemed to continue swinging Dem even as the country as a whole is in a Republican mood. We just flipped like 7 seats yesterday for a total of like 40 something net flips since 2020. This may not be as doomed as it may look at first glance. I don't know how true it really is but I've believed that GA is a relatively inelastic state (for a few reasons) and that once we flip there won't be much going back. If anyone can do it it'll be Stacey even if I hold a less positive opinion of her than many people do (not conceding elections is not cool regardless of party).Care to share your reasons why you think GA is inelastic? Just the growth of Atlanta?\s\sIt doesn't sound implausible to me; I'd just like to hear your thoughts on why.I think the last presidential election probably encouraged a lot of people who are democrat-inclined but thought voting blue in GA was a lost cause.Do you think that not conceding elections continues to not be cool even when the election was not free or fair? Not saying this was or wasn’t the case for Georgia but that is why Abrams didn’t concede.So we should concede that Maduro won fairly in Venezuela or Ortega in Nicaragua?\s\sNot conceding elections is not cool when they're fairWell best of luck to her.  I expect that she's in a structurally disadvantageous position at least in contesting an election against an incumbent but maybe her aptitude for political organizing and the occasional self-destructive habits of the Republican Party will see her through to victory.  Even a credible loss might be worth something.  The Democratic Party certainly would do well to 'claim new territory' as it were and Georgia seems relatively ripe for that.Remember that with the Republican gubernatorial candidate — it will either be Brian Kemp who is *deeply* unpopular with the deplorables or a MAGA crazy who won’t enthral high-turnout voters in the Atlanta suburbs.\s\sThere’s no room for a Glenn Youngkin-type candidate this time around if that accounts for anythingIt’ll be interesting to see Democrat success in Georgia will continue in a likely Republican swing year. If anyone can do it though it would be AbramsAt this point I'm not at all sure Kemp will even win the primary.\s\sHeh peach pun.> Even a credible loss might be worth something.\s\sdon't forget the significant and likely positive impact this will have on down ballot races in swing districtsShe should run for president in 24.Hope she wins!## Q U E E Nfuture president🎉 H Y P E 🎉yay!Excited to vote for her in my first electionWhy is this your first??SO BASED\s\sLike probably my favorite Dem in the country right nowI think you meant to post this in the Delaney thread.QUEEN IN THE SOUTH 👑👑👑👑SinemaThe chad Abrams gubernatorial campaign vs the virgin O'Rourke gubernatorial campaignIn reality both have embraced similar strategies that have paid off in terms of boosting Democratic support in the stateHell yeah. If she can pull this off it will be one of the great political comebacks of all time. Runs for Governor in 2018 and loses a tight race in the faces of major structural impediments placed by a long entrenched GOP. Refocuses her efforts on opening up the state to Dems. Helps deliver GA to Biden and ***two*** Senate seats to knock McConnell out of the Mjority Leader position he had counted on to subvert Biden’s Presidency. Now she’s coming back for the Governor’s mansion to tie things up.Never gonna happen. They didn’t like her in 2018 and they’re not gonna like her in 2022. She still hasn’t accepted her defeat from 2018.Great news. Really good news for the Senate as well.Go Stacey!👸🏿👸🏿👸🏿I really hope she runs for President one dayI think southern dems are starting to tilt more towards a religous conservative image for their black base. Which is incredibly based 😎😎😎🤢 if that's what it takes to win an election but I could never call social conservatism basedthe queen has arrivedGodspeedI look forward to voting for her for president one day!Send your downvotes my way as a georgian I still can't get passed the logistical issues of running a candidate who lost in 2018 against the same candidate she lost to. She did refuse to concede and it wasn't a good look. Of course I'll vote for her and I think she'll be an excellent governor. But I'm just not sure what's changed. 🤷‍♂️She doesn't have a shot. The gop has spent like the last year and a half demonizing her and now everyone knows who she is.Will the fact that both U.S. Senators in GA are now Dems actually work against her?  Something something ""balanced government"" something...Well keep in mind Dems have been flipping a ton of municipal seats in GA this year though obv the governors race is differentThat argument was used to try to prevent those Senators from being elected in the first place with the “divided government good” talking point — so I don’t think that would have any particular salience in this cycle when it’s less apparentI will never understand that logic.

That’s what $58000? \s\sThat’s pennies.The article points out what the actual issue is if you cared to bother to read bother to read it.I thought succs were all for universal programs 🧐I still remember the bitching about the income thresholds on stimulus checks.The real issue is how someone like George Soros who was named in the article could use the tax system to make it appear that they only had 124000 in income to the IRS.Oh no!  .0000001% checks were sent incorrectlyTell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article.So what?People with less than $150000 in 2019 income got checks that went out to everyone with less than $150000 in 2019 income. \s\sShocker.The problem is that the tax system sees them as having less than 129000 a year despite being billionaires.Clearly we should spend far more than $60000 in administrative costs to ensure that the government doesn’t spend $60000 in *that* manner. Of all the things that the government spends $60000 this is what this article decided to talk about.Didn't literally every American get some of the stimulus checks? I know I did I bought a new TV.I didnt .  Not one.  I wont vote for any of the scum that voted for the cares act either.  These UBI tax credits are divisive as hell.Based those people work very hard.Okay. I was told by the lefties that limiting who gets stimulus checks was a bad thing though.  Remember that?  Income thresholds bad.  I recall some even saying what's the big deal if Bill Gates got one.  Okay so now it's a big deal?I don’t want to sound callous but is this a big deal?

That’s about 4000 people out of nearly half a million employees in municipal police departments and sheriff’s offices nationwide.

There maybe actually enough employees but if most police officers flee the areas where they are needed most you basically get the same result. More crime against people who really need LEOs the most.Is this net though? There could be an uptick in the number of officers leaving the force and it’s just offset by increased hiringI wonder if large city cops migrating to the suburban areas is a significant number.

Probably makes sense for those enforcing the laws to know them.I'm pretty sure states require this already to pass police academys.Police don't enforce laws. Courts and sheriffs enforce laws. Police intervene in ongoing crimes and arrest suspected criminalsDoesn't it get brought up from time to time that policing is a specific degree- requiring job in Scandinavia? I guess this would be sort of the quicker way to a similar result. I'm in.I'm curious to hear this sub's thoughts on this considering the general perception of occupational licensing here.I think it's misguided. Will give them more bargaining power rather than less.I don't get it who do they think will fill those vacancies?""Never waste a good crisis"" <sigh>just follow the law lolDefund news outlets that write up articles on individual polls ([that are also outliers](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo)).True but his popularity is consistently low.\s\sHis approval rating is the lowest in modern history.40% of the soldiers were Republican/Libertarian 44% were independents and 16% were Democrats. 43% say they'll vote for Biden and only 37% will for Trump. Soldiers are typically a Republican stronghold and part of Trump's base. 52% dislike Obama.[deleted]lol at “Libertarian” military members. Most of the people I knew in the military call themselves libertarian now too and many of those work in nuclear power which is heavily subsidized.[deleted]What branch are you from?\s\sAnecdotally I seem to recall a lot of Navy redditors being incredibly pissed off at the way that CAPT Crozier was treated by the acting SECNAV and the whole debacle of how he was removed and reassigned.Do you think Mattis has anything to do with this shift? I know a handful of former Marines and they all have a deep respect for him.  When he was chosen at the outset that seemed to give a lot of them comfort. I haven’t been able to chat with them recently but I’d have to wager that Mattis’ strong rebuke of Trump _must_ impacted their opinions.Thank you for your service.As someone enlisted Army \s\sIt baffles me why anyone supports Trump. He doesn’t care about us. We’re just props. \s\sHe said he would take care of veterans and military families. But the facts speak for themselves. 35000 military families on food stamps. 22 veterans suicides every single day 45000 homeless veterans on the Nations street. \s\sInstead of Filling the 50000 vacancies at the VA he’s tried to privatize the whole system. I could go on\s\sOh yeah Also he’s a draft dodger. Remember when Republicans attacked Bill Clinton over that?You’re conflating reality with identity. A lot of these folks don’t care that R presidents routinely treat military members like actual crap because they wrap themselves with the flag and that hoo-rah BS gets people motivated a lot more than meaningful change like properly overseeing and funding the VA. \s\s23 years enlisted myself. A good chunk of the military is full of Ron Swansons who fancy themselves fiercely independent tough guys but in reality are totally dependent on the govt for their livelihoods and careers. That group of folks seems to be drawn to Trump because he talks their talk and says the things that they think. Also there is still a fair bit of racism and certainly sexism in parts of the military and my experience has been that the areas where that stuff is allowed to exist tends to be a bastion of support as well. \s\sThe office corps is generally better educated and thinks for themselves a little bit more and seems to be more evenly divided.\s\sOne thing is though that the military skews pretty young so it will be interesting to see what a difference this admin will make on younger folks whose peer group is like 80-20 negative towards Trump as they rise through the ranks.>Oh yeah Also he’s a draft dodger. Remember when Republicans attacked Bill Clinton over that?\s\sIt’s even worse IMO because Clinton didn’t use family connections or phony medical ailments to avoid Vietnam he had a scholarship to study at Oxford.>Also he’s a draft dodger. Remember when Republicans attacked Bill Clinton over that?\s\sI can't remember the circumstances with Clinton but I don't think it involved wealth and influence or ridiculous meidcal claims like bunions or whatever Trump used.  Motivation was different too.  Clinton was against the war.  Trump was against a rich important boy like himself having to be inconvenienced.His supporters were claiming he had given the military the largest pay increase ever just after his election.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThey still haven't gotten as large a pay bump as the first two they received under Obama.The VA is pretty fucking expensive and terrible. \s\sPut all veterans on medicaid. That system works better and is less expensive per person.This is particularly bad for Trump as in 2016 he was +33 in the same poll and Romney was +40 in 2012. If this is what we’re seeing he’s screwed.\s\sHowever if he’s seeing these numbers internally too that’s only another reason for him to call mail-in voting fraudI wonder if his attacks on mail in voting will lead to Democrats voting more in person and not trusting mail in voting?That's great but you know how deployed military generally votes? By mail.Do you know how many military members utilize the FVAP? Not many.The Military Times polls are a joke though. They poll their subscribers and as one can imagine the population of the people who actually bother to spend money on a subscription for it is different than the general active duty population.Perhaps. There's still a major shift compared to their prior polls.This bodes very well for the military being on Biden's side if Trump refuses to leave. Especially officers being trump's strongest opposition.He can't refuse to leave the office. He can only refuse to leave the building. In which case it's a matter for the police. The military will not recognize him as C in C unless he is inaugurated as the next President. If the election isn't confirmed by the Congress he ain't the President.Firstly I doubt this poll is accurate.  \s\sSecondly Tsk so many bad understandings of military culture and shit theories trying to push this subs preconceived notions of who votes blue or red in our society wrt education and income.\s\sThe AF is the most conservative branch even though it's one of the sMaRTesT  In fact the most conservative identifying branches are the AF and the USMC.  Officers are more likely to be registered as republicans than Enlisted.  And the younger cohorts of soldiers are more likely to be blue.  \s\sIn fact despite this one poll and the apparent belief of the comments for a long time officers were more likely to identify with a specific party and be partisan and of those two parties more likely to be red.\s\sService Members are also more likely to vote compared to their age demographic which is why you tend to see such high third party totals.Do you have a source for the AF being the most conservative?BaaaaasedThe pollster is very funky in 2016 they showed Johnson ahead of Clinton which was clearly absurd even for the active duty military vote.Trump lost so much respect from the army when he fired Mattis. The comments were flooded with veterans and people enlisted when he did that.Mattis was a marine corps general not army and he left in his own in protest after Trump abandoned the Kurds. You are right though a lot of vets were upset about it after Trump started talking shit about him afterwards.Now the tent has a camouflage wing!As an officer in the AF most of my friends in engineering/space/intel are all pretty liberal. \s\sIn my experience the rated community skews a LOT more conservative especially any platform in ACC (fighters)  AFSOC (spec ops) or Global Strike Command (bombers).> The Palestinian issue is not complicated and it is not difficult to see who is in the wrong in the debate about it.\s\sWell this makes it easy to see that the author doesn't really know what they're talking about. Calling Israel/Palestine ""simple"" is naïve at best and terminally biased at worst.how is it not an apartheid state where they literally just passed a law making arabs second class citizens? how is it not a theocracy? how is the gaza strip not a gigantic open air prison? how do you find it remotely plausible that hamas is ""tricking"" obviously desperate people into throwing rocks and getting their skulls spilt by idf snipers? what insane argument do you have to justify israeli settlements that blatantly violate international law?  how is the netanyahu and likud party not extremely right wing corrupt racist and cruel? Terrible article. All sorts of polices framed as empowering the weak have the opposite effect. Rent control NIMBYism protectionism pacifism ""small town values"" etc. Wait.

That wasn’t necessarily because they weren’t working. It was mainly because it was so difficult to satisfy all the reporting requirements.\s\s> Which is a feature not a bug of work requirements. By forcing recipients to prove they’re working and navigate a bureaucratic maze to stay in the program the state gives itself an excuse to kick off those who make a paperwork mistake or miss a reporting deadline.\s\s\s#\s\s\s> Biden’s reversal began just after he took office. In February the administration informed states that it was preparing to withdraw approvals for work requirements granted under Trump.\s\s#\s\s> This legacy is being erased in another way. Under Biden the same ACA that Trump tried to destroy is expanding and moving toward realizing its potential. A record number of more than 13 million people have signed up for 2022 coverage on the exchanges.\s\s> A key reason for this is that the covid-19 rescue plan that Biden signed in March expanded the number of people eligible for ACA subsidies and beefed up subsidies for those already eligible. As Margot Sanger-Katz details in the New York Times this is a real achievement: It substantially reimagines and expands the ACA amid a pandemic meaning the ACA is rising to an emergency occasion.\s\sFull archive link: https://archive.ph/GGgi2It almost like joe Biden is a good president 🤔Why would anyone give a shit about that when it doesn't personally benefit me a white upper-middle-class college student? Clearly Biden hasn't done anything that *actually* matters. Both Sides.He should start loudly erasing Trump's legacies.That’ll just pick a fight with Republicans making it harder to accomplish and galvanizing Republican voters.It’s infrastructure week again already?\s\sBiden’s already had at least twice as many as Trump hadHold on a minute Jack you think it’s just one infrastructure week? 💎🍦It’s infrastructure year!>Increased surveillance by the IRS to audit high-income people. Financial institutions are required to report income from their investments and business activities in a manner similar to that made for employees. This should bring in $700 billion per year.\s\sWHAT. Is it really that much? I am a little incredulous it will bring in that much but even if it brings in half of that that feels like a no brainer.It also seems like maybe it should fill some prison cells ...Doesn’t Robert Mercer alone owe something crazy like 10 billon?Good job.Is Biden a secret succ?Always has been.Idk. I'm ok with this one because a more educated population benefits corporations and helps them stay competitive globally. So in a sense the taxes are being reinvested right back into them.What's a trillion here another trillion there?\s\sAt the rate the government is spending they may as well be printing out money on toilet paper...that's all it's going to be worth after the inevitable inflation.God we should be so lucky to get a little inflation going.But they aren't printing money for this?\s\sThis is coming out of tax revenue.Look at Japan. They owe 237% of their GDP and have owed more than 100% since the 90s. Their economy is doing perfectly fine (besides demographic problems that in no way are related to the debt).You missed the part where he literally plans to pay for this with tax money but ok.A little inflation is good actually it lowers the burden of debt and signals a robust economy. The feds are targeting 2.6% and they'll likely fail to even get that high. In 2010 they made the same target and came in under.Based bidenI was wondering what neoliberals opinions would be on the growing trade deficit under Trump?  \s\sI think most on this sub would agree that deficits aren't all bad and is the result of optimal trading that economically benefits the consumer and supplier populations.  \s\sObviously like many of Trump's own practices he didn't deliver but would you guys consider this a positive result during his tenure.And Pelosi should have her signature on it.I sadly doubt it'll end up passing.I'm hopeful.Gotta throw mail-in voting into this one plsPlease please pass\^Yeah but the gop are the real progressives cause they offered 1200 first mkay. You filthy neoliberals! \s\s/sOutflankedWhaddya mean?I don't need or want this money. \s\sGive it to someone else plsGive it to charity then claim it on your taxes next yearspend it.What's the reasoning for this package? I understand that people who lost their income already got additional benefits. \s\sIs it to fill the gaps for people who don't get unemployment benefits?For what falls through the cracks; keep consumer spending up and the economy from contracting too much.The entire Federal government spends around $370B/mo. This plan would cost $440B/mo. \s\sWe’re talking about more than doubling the size of the government overnight.\s\sAnd for what? Anyone who has kept their job doesn’t really need it. Anyone who last their job and makes under $50-$60k/yr is making more now than they did working. Who are we trying to protect with these *trillions* a year in payments?\s\sThe cost of doing this for 6 months would be similar to that of offering free college tuition for the next 30 years.I mean it's not like finding the money is actually a problem. We already funded CARES and money printer go brrr. \s\sAs far as who we're trying to protect - unemployment just spiked the stock market took a dive and GDP is contracting. So everyone? \s\sA lot of people are saying that the fundamentals of the economy are sound that everything will rebound quickly (relative to other contractions) because there was nothing fundamentally wrong in the first place.\s\sThere may be some merit to this but it is far far easier to destroy something than it is to build it. The economic impact of Coronavirus will be felt for a long time.\s\sBetween now and the country reopening how many are going to struggle and how many businesses are going to buckle and fail?I would rather expand the UI bonuses and eligibility furtherBy the same amount of money?Realistically I think the Justice Department will be very hesitant to dredge up the Kavanaugh issue again. An investigation should have occurred before Kavanaugh was confirmed and DOJ might quietly review their previous review but there are very legitimate concerns about partisan attacks on the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the FBI and I'm skeptical there will be evidence or political will for a SCOTUS impeachment considering the potential long-lasting consequences of that for Democrats.\s\sI don't disagree with reviews and I understand that there are concerns about Chris Wray which given his response to questions about the Capitol riot are legitimate but the issue should be approached cautiously. More upheaval in leadership would likely not be helpful unless absolutely necessary.The rape issue is not worth bringing up again due to the political implications but I want to know about his debts cleared.>  considering the potential long-lasting consequences of that for Democrats.\s\sToo be fair democrats aren't the best putting that into their calculations. \s\s*looks at Harry Reid*Curious about the endgame here. Seems like there are a long list of pipe dreams for a 50-50 senate queued up before impeaching Justice Boof. You’ve got a better shot of changing the balance of the Supreme Court by packing it than this.Really? Because I think Manchin can sell outting cap'n boof easier than packing.Bet it’s Feinstein.[deleted]Who cares? What could it possibly show that would make any difference to anythingA lot actually. If a background check was faked by the FBI in relation to getting someone onto the Supreme Court that's extremely dishonest and a clear example of not just flouting the rules but breaking them. If this did indeed happen then the Senate can open hearings if its determined that Kavanaugh knew about the fake check that is grounds for impeachment and removal from the Supreme Court.Aside from what everyone else has said about Kavanaugh himself the importance of determining whether federal law enforcement officers were used and acted as political tools is of huge importance.Hmm go figure!Good idea.  That’s one of several thousand “Trump” things that need to be looked at in a non-partisan fashion.This is like the definition of populism. WTF I love populism nowWhile 70% is even absurdly high for a social democrat like me. The rising inequality and rampant protection of the rich in the us by the republicans was bound to get a huge backlashIt's taxation NIMBYism. No wonder the succs love itAnd rightfully so. A 70% rate is well supported by Piketty and Saez.Let's not pretend that Piketty and Saez represent the majority of experts on the topic. A 70% rate isn't ""definitely won't work and all economists oppose it"" but it is ""probably won't work and a majority of economists oppose it"".\s\sIt is also worth distinguishing what a 70% marginal tax rate actually means. A 70% federal income tax would combine  with state and local taxes to reach ~90%. That's going to have a very different effect on behavior than a federal income tax set to combine with state and local taxes to reach 70% overall.\s\sGiven the uncertainty of the optimal highest marginal tax rate the best way to implement it is gradually raising it.poll: a majority of Americans support shitty policy\s\sno surprise though\s[deleted]This is not socialism what the fuckRising inequality and decades long wage stagnation are real problems that need to be solved. Also it is really disingenuous to imply that calling for high marginal tax rates are the same thing as the what happened in the Warsaw Pact. You can debate these things without being hyperbolic. There are free market democratic countries with high tax burdens. I doubt he resigns but this is almost certainly his last term in any public office. Wild to see him go from future presidential candidate to a complete pariah in the party.I'm genuinely having trouble gauging how big this news will be. The right will obviously run with it to some extent but that doesn't really matter at all for a New York politician. \s\sI doubt he will run again and I personally found the presentation fairly compelling but I'm not sure if there is a large audience for this scandal at this stage.Does he get impeached or recalled or whatever?He was always a non-starter as presidential candidate.Like Michael Avenatti lulzHe was a future presidential candidate for about 10 minutes last April when the chattering classes needed a Man of Action to be horny about and Fauci didn’t have a brother who hosted a show on CNN.This is not wild for US partisan politics especially with DNP politics.I think more than just last term in office this should be jail time 100% IMO. I mean probably not actually cause the law is really lenient on sex pests but it *should*.So he's like Bill Clinton but without the presidency.Really you give the American public too much credit weren't the two candidates in the last Presidential election accused of sexual harassment and Clinton back in the day got a second term even with the stuff he was accused of. Isn't the governor of California an admitted adulterer the last President and the current Vice-President also. Those moral issues are no longer disqualifiers in American politics.Dudes been pretty obstinate about this. Id be surprised if he resigns. Any chance the state dems force him to?I’m guessing he’ll announce he’s not running again and they’ll call it a day.Only situation I see is a far left and Republican coalition to remove him. He’s still the king maker in NYS politics even despite his fall from grace. I would be surprised to see many moderate dems cross him on the level of an impeachmentThey have done barely anything because of covidAt bare minimum I doubt he's able to clear the field before the primary next year. Traditionally it's been Cuomo vs some leftwing nobody. At bare minimum I expect some other people to be less scared about throwing their hats into the ring. That might be enough to prevent him from seeking another term.Remember when people wanted to draft this guy to replace Biden lmaoNo one apart from some political Twitter junkies wanted that.Briefly but as soon as I heard he tried to hide his reports for covid I hated him. Biden wasn’t perfect either but he is doing better then him[removed]RIP BOZO 😎SMOKING THAT CUOMO PACKheck off and resign we don't need a Diet Matt Gaetz in the partyYou don’t know anything about Andrew cuomo if you think he’s gonna resign.

Only took a decade.Eh. It’s not it being outside of NY it’s a new era where shit like this isn’t tolerated by the public or the officials anymore. Things have changed. \s\sI doubt there are still protections in place for the victims though. Then complaining will likely still cost them work.This man released a book about himself in the middle of the pandemic lmao. And now he’s a disgraced piece of shit.\s\sHe should absolutely resign though I doubt he will unfortunately.Does this change anything? When the accusations were first being reported on the women accusing him of sexual harassment were clearly credible and even just at face value it wasn’t that outlandish to imagine the guy who often acts like such a dickhead out in the open is the same way behind closed doors.\s\s[This is exactly who Cuomo is](https://nypost.com/2021/02/17/cuomo-threat-to-dem-you-havent-seen-my-wrath-you-will-be-destroyed/) much like Trump he thinks of himself as some kind of suave mobster. To be fair those two have each attained a level of power that has only reinforced their behavior (being born to very wealthy and powerful fathers helped set the stage of course) but ultimately the guy is a textbook bully. Simple asShuts up people who said ""wait and see the outcome of the investigation"".We needed him briefly during covid but there is no reason to not impeach and remove himCuomo is beyond Trump because of walking the misogynist walk versus mostly talking it on Trump's part. Cuomo's and President Biden's power to wield in sex harassment and assault is also United States voter power and not United States dollar power. One is prostitution the other is usurpery.Andrew Yang Gubernatorial run pending😑🔫Lock Him Up.Finally.

0,AmericanPolitics,Destiny,132,"no shit sherlocksurprised pikachu[deleted][http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope\_economic\_consequences\_of\_major\_tax\_cuts\_published.pdf](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf)  \sAll you  have to do is google the name of the people in the article my dude.I learned from destiny that usually you get the gist of it by just reading the headline.shock.horror.surprise.[deleted][deleted][deleted]I'd also like to add that his argument about voter suppression having low impact is weird in a couple of ways.\s\s1) It's a really difficult thing to evaluate and is highly dependent on a number of factors.\s\s2) It's not about stopping those truly dedicated voters it's about making it enough of a pain that for people either forget or have aren't willing to go through too much of an inconvenience (it's a sad reality that not everyone understand how much voting truly matters but that much means the process should be as simple and easy as possible).\s\s3) If there were truly little to no effects why would republicans be putting so much effort and political capital into it? It's for the same reason it's self evident a company who is paying someone for advertisement (hello gambling streams) is getting a good ROI.\s\s4) Even if some of these are declared unconstitutional it won't matter if they manage to affect an election it's happened before and there's little in the way of punishment for those people.\s\s5) Simple slippery slope doing this makes it easier to erode more in the future in small increments where it's hard to argue how much a day loss here and there matters.These arguments are pretty easily countered. And to be clear I'm not saying this legislation is okay. I think normatively that everyone should be able to easily vote regardless of the partisan impact. But the evidence does not show this as having a major partisan impact. Also I should make it clear that destiny is completely wrong about gerrymandering which unlike voter suppression has a massive partisan effect on elections (about 6 points in 2012).\s  \s  \s   \s The most marginal voters are non-college white voters which are the vast majority of trump's base.\s\sThere's tons of examples of this but a particularly clear one is the GA runoffs.\s\sIn 2008 the Democratic base was far more reliant on non-college voters and the GA runoff was R+15 after the first election was R+3. \s\sIn 2020 the runoffs went from R+2 to D+1 due to the Republicans being much more reliant on non college voters who don't turn out as often.\s\s\s\shttps://twitter.com/lxeagle17/status/1408842488408801280?s=19\s\sHere's another example. Non-college turnout goes significantly down in midterms. If the coalitions were the same now as they were in 2010 the Republican landslide turns into an even fight. \s\s\sStudies also found that voting expansion doesnt lead to a partisan gain.\s\shttps://twitter.com/hill_charlotte/status/1404462614780866562\s\s\s\s\s1: Anything related to elections is but that doesn't prevent us from coming to a conclusion with a reasonable level of confidence. \s\s2: The GOP has the most low propensity voters so these measures are just as likely to hurt their own voters.\s\s3: Politicians (and especially Republicans) are not perfectly rational. They're doing it to appease their base who are very mad because they think the election was stolen.\s\s4: This is away from the core argument and I don't think this will effect an election anyway.\s\s\s5:  Sure which is why I think these laws are bad. That doesn't mean there's a partisan effect though.> 3) If there were truly little to no effects why would republicans be putting so much effort and political capital into it? It's for the same reason it's self evident a company who is paying someone for advertisement (hello gambling streams) is getting a good ROI.\s\sI mean it can have barely noticeable effect and still be #1 priority in swing states or just in elections that tend to be decided by few dozens of votes. And the best part about it is that it might not even cost them that much political capital if any as long as they frame it as ""securing the election so that daddy Trump doesn't lose next time"".But talking about current events would take more time and effort than shitting on Twitter all day to quote our dear friends Michael from PA or something like that.I think he's been getting in the swing of it again relatively speaking but yeah twitter has been cancer for the content.Yeah I was kinda surprised to hear him say in his conversation with Pakman that Democrats are trying to rig the election process and that voter suppression by Republicans is an overblown issue. It's something I'd also like to hear him elaborate on.Oh right that's something I forgot to mention in my points to me it's insane to pretend that the democrats are trying to rig the process in their favor.\s\sThe comparaison I'd use is thinking that trying to fix a balance with a rock stuck to the bottom of one side is unfair because you're changing the system to win. Yeah no shit you're trying to make it fair and you know that it being fair is gonna make it easier for you to win.\s\sInnuendos Studios [has a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAbab8aP4_A) about the insanity of going high when the opponent goes low.Which video is that?I read a while back that the effect is minimal on turnout stopping fraud and suppression. In the end there is no real need to put barriers up so it's really weird to hyper focus on them when the people they clearly affect the poor and elderly. It's all kind of pandering to respective bases but there's no real good reason for the Republican billsYeah how about he debates me about ethnostates instead?\s\spros: godlike content.\s\scons: as unproductive as talking about online trans shit.[](/SoDoge)[It's](https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/783397272394600450) [fucking](https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/783400062370123777) [nothing](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/04/guccifer-2-0-claims-to-have-hacked-clinton-foundation/)It's being suggested in the comments that this post is below the standard previously set by Guccifer 2.0 and that the blog may currently be under someone else's control. I haven't been following this shit so maybe it's just a meme.[deleted]This was my read too. Obviously the rally/protest where Trump spoke was planned. He didn’t spontaneously appear nor did the crowds. But I didn’t lead anything that said the storming of the Capitol was planned. I think this is a pretty shitty headline/photo combination for rolling stone to use.My response would be why would Gosar dangle pardons if there wasnt something nefarious intended by the ""protest""\s\sEdit: also why in the hell would Mo Brooks (a congressman) feel the need to wear body armor at his own rally???To be clear this is new. At the time those statements were made there was absolutely no evidence of these meetings happening. There was no reason to believe that was the case until today really. Additionally all we have now is just two anonymous sources which is not nothing but not at all proof.\s\sWould be fucking crazy if all they're telling is true though. Sitting Congressman dangling pardons direct line of communication to the president's team and all sorts of other awful shit.[deleted]>To be clear this is new. At the time those statements were made there was absolutely no evidence of these meetings happening. There was no reason to believe that was the case until today really.\s\sThats not true at all. There were plenty of articles about these things well before this going back to how Trump was trying to get Pence on board. Woodward's book even cites some of these meetings.Bullshit. Stop playing simp for Steven. I'm sick of the ignorance of people here when it comes to calling Jan 6th an insurrection and properly classifying it. It was a coup attempt planned and motivated. For years militia groups have been waiting for this moment. Just because they failed doesn't mean it wasn't a coup attempt. It also doesn't mean the threat is gone.I'm pretty I saw a video on a politician telling people in a crowd that he was going to leave some door openhttps://twitter.com/funder/status/1452464537869897728And there was absolutely no evidence that it wasn't conspired lol\s\sEdit: downvotes are funny. If you have no evidence for either case you should just not talk about it. Destiny said he think insurrection is a harsh word. It isn't. They tried to overturn the election.I'm pretty sure he was talking about the mass of people having a plan. Not a few groups or individuals. Also I would would wait until this investigation is finished.Yea it seems pretty clear that some people in the crowd (Proud Boys) were trying to escalate the situation intentionally. I think what Destiny is referring to as the majority of attendees.OP I have a question on a scale of 1 to 10 how awful would you say Jan 6th was? We'll see McDonald's ice cream machine broken is a 1 and 9/11 is a 10.Well alot of people may disagree but we are talking about domestic terrorists violence with a political motive....the only people that were killed as a direct result were the terrorists I believe one person got trampled and the other was shot in the capitol but I could be wrong about the first instance thats less deaths than 9/11 but still technically a terrorist attack..Id say a 9\s\sEdit: I gave alot of weight to my belief that the actions of the people on Jan 6th constitutes an attempt to take control of the government. There have been more deadly domestic terrorist attacks...oklahoma city bombing...but this was worse because it couldve ended with a bunch of militias having control of our capitol with congress people as hostagesPlan to protest? Sure\s\sPlan to break shit up? Maybe\s\sPlan to storm the capitol? Definitely not\s\sPlan to take over control? You can only really atribute that to trumpBullshit. But keep sucking daddy Steves dick all you want. \s\sI get it right now this community is on the lefty arc still but the right and its militia groups almost overturned an election and installed a monarchy. Fuck outta here with this shit. \s\sPlan to protest? YES\s\sPlan to break shit up? YES\s\sPlan to storm the capitol? YES listen to the speakers before Trump and to the rhetoric from his henchmen going on since he lost the election\s\sPlan to take over control? YES. Militias have been waiting for this moment for years. The only question is was this the actual attempt and they failed or was it merely a practice run? \s\sI'm sick of you fuckers acting like it wasn't a big deal.Seems like a big load of nothing\s\sOf course there was planning between the politicians attending a protest planned in advance that the president spoke at.\s\sTaking that and suggesting that because they helped plan the legally permitted protest is planning the riot is a big big stretch.You are very ignorant. But yeah ride that fenceAnd those who testified said their was no plan to enter the capital.Alex Jones already explained exactly what happened.""The Guardian has shown the documents to independent experts who say they appear to be genuine. Incidental details come across as accurate. The overall tone and thrust is said to be consistent with Kremlin security thinking.""\s\sThis is the problem with the story - amazing bombshell shitty sourcing. The grauniad has some documents and they *seem* real enough but really who knows. Maybe it's true maybe it's authentic but maybe it's just some bullshit somebody made up because there's an audience for it out there.We won't know for sure unless the Biden administration makes a public statement. If the CIA decides they're genuine Biden might have to do something diplomatically maybe sanctions.How do we know these documents are authentic?We don't. Independent experts have said the documents seem genuine and intelligence agencies know about them. Actual confirmation will probably only happen if the Biden admin makes a statement.\s\sWhen I first read this I figured it had to be fake. The Putin signature the Trump insults and the reference to unspecified ""certain events"". But after reading it again I think that someone forging something like this would come up with a more realistic sounding lie. I think it's real but who knows until we get confirmation.I'll upvote literally anything that isn't about lefties twitter or ""g\*\*\*no""Woah!This isn’t really that huge. Governments have been interfering in elections for over a hundred years. Historians have even established that massive election interference was going on by the British and Germans when FDR was running for his third term. [(Source) ](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300205749/1940)Iran and China interfered on Biden’s behalf and Russia did for Trump. None of this is news to people who are well informed on the subject. \s\sThe only thing that can be construed as “huge” is the alleged confirmation of kompromat in the documents. However it doesn’t even seem to confirm that kompromat exists. The article spends only a few sentences covering what would be the biggest scandal in the past few decades using very vague language. It’s pretty clear that author was just grasping at straws here. \s\sOverall if the documents are credible we haven’t really learned anything new. It won’t affect people who think Russia hasn’t interfered in the election because everyone who thinks that at this point will think everything negative of Trump is fake news. The media certainly hasn’t helped considering that they treat interference and collusion as essentially the same thing with their partisan editorializing of unfortunately common occurrences in international espionage.No offense but I don’t think anyone cares about thisIf Trump really was a russian stooge and he owed them money & was being blackmailed by underage piss tapes or whatever... then wow did putin set a very low bar for him because he basically did fuck all to improve russian global position.“By this point Trump was the frontrunner in the Republican party’s nomination race.” nothing burgerIt will be interesting to see how the far right and far left react to thisInsane. I wonder if the current or former president have documents on their plans to influence other states' leadership?I have a hard time believing that this woman who was vice chair of the DNC for many many years was as clueless as she says about the party's finances.just pivoting to the left wing so she can participate in either Benies or Warren's 2020 run. Yesterday she was a DNC insider monster who stabbed the revolution in the back today shes a brave truth teller.Didn't she help Hilary ""cheat"" or w/e by giving her questions early for a debate? \s\sIt's not really surprising what has been revealed but *who's* revealed it.As do I but I'm appreciative that she came forward with specifics rather than talking in hushed innuendo. At least from my perspective having the missteps of the DNC out in the open assuages some of my fears that the country has culturally shifted in a significant way. It seems pretty clear that Hillary lost due to strong-arming her way into a nomination irrespective of the actual wants of the voters and that plus her hubris in campaign strategy lead to her downfall.[deleted]I think you're missing the point here. Neither of those articles say anything about the specifics of the agreement just that they existed. It appears that such agreements are proforma what is not standard operating procedure is those agreements being signed so early and giving so much control over to a candidate who has not yet clinched the nomination. That is a revelation and regardless of how Brazile is trying to spin it still warrants discussion so that the same mistakes can be avoided for 2020.Thanks for this insight. I also hadn't even realized the author of this passage is the same woman who leaked debate questions to Hilary.

I would highly recommend giving it a listen: https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/gerrymandering-podcast/Can’t wait for Hasan to go over this article on his stream. PepeLaughHonestly... I'm not that worried about gerrymandering. Mainly because it's almost impossible to get worse without jeopardizing different safe seats. Republicans are actually giving dems safe seats just to get rid of the competitive districts. Considering dems will prob lose those districts anyway in midterms it shouldn't affect much.\s\sEdit: just for an example. Ohio and NC got worse and dems lost one seat each BUT Texas gave dems 3 safe seats so it's kinda a washlolCurious what you all think. Is she brain dead enough to believe she will be accepted into Republican ranks over a harder right person?\s\sDoes she think this will make her more popular in a presidential run? By all accounts it seems like she’ll get primaried in 2024.I think getting riled up after shaking hands is silly.\s\sI *do* think she’s on track to be primaried in 24 but that’s pretty far away and I don’t have high hopes for whoever primaries her to be able to carry AZ so it’s possible that there isn’t a serious challenger to her.\s\sStill 24 is a looooong way away and I think we’re better served thinking about this yearI agree we should focus on the now but this woman’s behavior is simply baffling.\sI’m also deeply concerned that a red swing this year will lead to an actual stolen election in 24.\s\sI genuinely wish there was something more I could do but I’m in an already deep blue state and all the orgs I try to contact are barely functioning because of Covid.- lose election\s- tell every institution the election was corrupt\s- accuse everybody who disagrees of being a loser\s\sSigma Male GrindsetNice to see Trump's overt fascism in the news again👍""Just say the Yee vote was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the P men"" DanSorry Nana you cant get your meds delivered and Grandpa died of COVID Trumps got Libs to own.Trump supporters: ""Here's how nana not getting her meds on time is actually a good thing""[deleted]lol America.

The less you rely on the USPS the better.\s\sHowever you vote do it as early as possible.What do you say to people who have fears that early votes might be tampered with? I hear that a lot from Southern democrats especially people of color. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sNot to mention a lot of these places don't have the same luxurious vote by mail programs. In SC for example you have to present a good reason (Covid isn't one though I believe age and other health factors can be) to get an absentee ballot.With the Democrats being so spineless in their reply to all of his PUBLIC admissions I am worrying whether my own politicians are this spineless as well.I think what you mean is complicit. They don't nominate a white racist rapist and a cop for no reason.  \s\s\sFor the donors of the DNC a RNC win is still a win.I'm honestly curious how much this will hurt his own voters compared to Biden voterswith his calls to take away Social security covid and the postal service stuff. IDK how the 60+ is still voting for himSo when are we going to overthrow the government?\s\s... In a video game[deleted]Nobody is overthrowing anything except in their larping fantasies.When is the military going in to get Trump out?  Where will his trial be held?   Will his execution be broadcast live?Nothing is gonna happen if his rigged election plays outAnd no one will do anything except wag their fingers while he starts his second of many terms.Do anyone have either articles or just a general feeling for weather people will go out and vote in person if they feel that they have to? \s\sMaybe I’m reading to much news but at this point I would start to feel doubt about my mail in ballot being counted properly if I was in the US. \s\sAlso can US people vote in person even if they’ve already cast a mail in? Or are you stuck once you’ve mailed the ballot? I’d be worried about increasing negative news as Election Day draws closer... :(Well now that he admitted it im sure we got him. Where Mueller at?Don't wanna be a sooner but I feel like Trump is definitely gonna win again. Hope I am wrongIs this sub actually falling for this vice sensationalist bullshit?\s\s""They need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots” Trump said on Fox Business Thursday morning of the states that are implementing universal mail-in voting ahead of the November election. “But if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.”""\s\s""“They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting” Trump said of the Post Office which is requesting billions in emergency funding. “So therefore they can’t do it I guess. Are they going to do it even if they don’t have the money?”""\s\sThese are the only 2 statements present in the article that Trump has made. None of them indicate that he is actually sabotaging the USPS to screw up the election.\s\sWhat do they say is the obvious: Money is lacking to update and modernize the systems of the USPS to process mail in ballotting and if the money doesn't go to the USPS they most likely won't be able to do it or will have an insane amount of difficulty in doing it which is why Trump questions the methodology in this scenario.\s\sAlso remember Congress puts the money into the USPS not Trump. Trump only signs off on it and if he doesn't then Congress can just pass through him. Not only is the article wrong the title is extremely misleading and bullshit.\s\sPolishing for the downvotes by the libs that didn't read the article 😎😎😎😎😎Why would anyone give Trump the benefit of the doubt?I agree that Vice and the headline are shit. But for the President of the United States in the middle of a national crisis to be gleefully shrugging off concerns about people being unable to vote and making it clear he won't lift a finger to help is a fucking travesty.God everything Trump did was so shady but the shit he and his people pulled between the election and Biden’s innaguration was actually frightening. \s\sIt’s weird we don’t talk about it more on this subreddit but we should.It’s funny that the Jan 6 riot is actually distracting from this more severe shit they were doing in the background. If trump did 10% of the shit he pulls he would sink but the sheer volume of shit drowns out any singular bad thing and people just ignore it.""The order empowers the defense secretary to \s\s**""seize collect retain and analyze all machines equipment electronically stored information and material records required for retention under""** \s\sa U.S. law that relates to preservation of election records. It also cites a lawsuit filed in 2017 against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.*\s\s*Additionally the draft order would have given the defense secretary 60 days to write an assessment of the 2020 election. That suggests it could have been a gambit to keep Trump in power until at least mid-February of 2021.""*Not a big deal btw we don’t like Trump because he says mean things and tells it like it is.\s\sHe created 3 historic vaccines btw probably one of the greatest leaders in the history of the world.

I don't think they thought that one through.Looks like someone forgot to check his integrity at the door.Is there some point where we should take it more serious that they are riling up his base while calling democrats ""thieves"" and ""traitors""?OAN is way more biased than Fox and that's saying somethingThe fact that you would even consider OAN relevant enough to compare to fox means that Trumps disinformation campaign is working.\s\sI’m not trying to flame but just remember that OAN was not something anyone thought about until Trump started pumping it up as a news source for his base to spread misinformation.\s\sFox’s news is hella biased and often wrong but OAN is propaganda in its purest form and should never be considered news.I can not wait until the Trumpkins discover RT. Oh that will be the death of the conservative movement.I mean Fox has some good apples. If you ignore Hannity Tucker and Engram Fox and Friends and the Five they actually have some good journalists with dignity and ethics. They still skew their reporting to conservative but they will still not allow this type of Autogolpe attempt.It really owns that this guy accused an ex-FBI director a sitting presidential candidate and the head of our Covid-19 response of sexual assault and he is like...not in jail or anything.

I’ve never had a problem with them personally but I know others that have. They always try to intimidate physically smaller people which is infuriating when those same people are far more courteous to me simply because of my stature.\s\sI’ve been numb for four years. To be completely honest I’m nervous about being hopeful again and I fear that I’ll never be overly optimistic again within my lifetime as I always was as a result of Trump being elected in the first place.

The bush gore election dragged on into JanuaryThis is something I think destiny should discuss.He’s been correctly critical of Manchin’s critics before but this seems way beyond the pail for me. He essentially is working with republicans to save the filibuster and create good optics for him at the expense of other democrats. \sAlso the section about Roy blunt seems particularly sketchy as it seems he’s implying the donors hook him up with some money or cushy job once he retires in exchange for a vote change. It’s definitely worsened my view of Manchin and I wonder what destiny would say about it.From what I can tell Manchin was the one that appeared in control during most of that conference call while the donors were basically glorified inter-party diplomats.Bit of a weird argument it doesn't change how he's trying to appeal to them and that they're trying to reach a common goal.I want to listen to audio but its 60 mins so it will wait so i read the article in the mean time.\s\s> THE GROUP IS passionately supportive of the filibuster and when multiple donors quizzed Manchin on his stance on it the senator displayed an openness to reform that is at odds with his latest public statements.\s\sDoesnt this kinda contradict your argument. He and the donors are clearly on different pages albeit in the grand scheme are probably closer than him with much of the rest of the Dem party (but thats not surprising).\s\sTo me this meeting seems more like a strategy discussion. Manchin has his goal in mind and this group has their goals in mind. They are meeting because in the larger picture their goals are similiar they want bipartisanship. They are discussing ways to move forward on that.\s\s> Manchin told the assembled donors that he needed help flipping a handful of Republicans from no to yes on the January 6 commission in order to strip the “far left” of their best argument against the filibuster. \s\sI think this statement is pretty evident of that. Jan 6 needs an investigation not just because of its historical relevance but the precedent of investigations demand it. If Benghazi can get one this should also. Both manchin and the group have their reasons for wanting the filubuster to stay but rejecting what should be a necessary investigation hurts their argument. This isnt an infrastructure bill where its dollars and spending philosophy at play. This is an attack on democracy that both parties should stand behind but is being blocked by a tool that in their eyes is meant to promote bipartisanship not ruin (which we can all agree it has been very much abused the past years).\s\sI think there is probably congress people who are influenced heavily by donors not doubt but this doesnt really seem like a case more just two groups with similar goals trying to find a means to an end.does it thoughThe leaks don’t really show the power of big donors as much as it shows Manchin’s power to control big donors.I wouldn't say plainly. It's hard to know just how much influence this group has as the language is pretty vague. The only thing this clearly establishes is that big donors have access to politicians which is not something that was ever in dispute.\s\sClearly Manchin was asking members of this group who will be working with Roy Blunt in future to make their preferences clear to him in order to put some pressure on for him to change his vote. We don't know the form that this pressure would take. It could be as subtle as a conversation or as much as a veiled threat that he would lose his future job if he didn't vote they right way. We simply don't know.Can I have meetings like this with my senator?Because it's ""self-defense"". In the racist mind any attack from a white guy to another group can be excused that way. \s\sOr in the words of the great Carlgon of Washing Machine: https://youtu.be/l9E2iEi6vMY?t=34m10s\sThe perpetrator was charged for his crimes tho? It's not like the neo-nazi walked out of the synagogue with blood on his hands and was congratulated by Trump himself for proactively defending his race against a Judeo-Marxist conspiracy to infiltrate and annihilate the Aryan race in the eternal race struggle.>why is the response so different\s\sThis is truly one of our times hardest conundrums to understand but after submerging myself in the politics of the right wing for decades and really getting to understand their mindset and nuanced perspectives I think I have uncovered the colourfull answer to this multifaceted behemoth of a question:\s\s\#8A4B08 BAD\s\s\#F8E0E6 GOODWhat the fuck are you guys even talking about? I haven't followed the response super super closely but what I have seen is Trump and Pence condemn the attacks both sides blame each other (trumps rhetoric/ media creating division) and Trump even admitted he could tone down his rhetoric. So what is the issue exactly? Did Trump come out and say that the bomber was a good guy? I just don't get what you are complaining about exactly.\s\sMeanwhile circle jerk central is down voting to oblivion anyone who dares disagree with this nonsense. ""If either individuals were islamist we'd probably have a patriot act 2.0"" is not an argument you can actually prove. Me saying ""If we had Hilary Clinton as president we'd probably be in WW3 with Russia"" has the same veracity as that kind of claim. Are we going to sit around and argue about hypothetical what if realities? Sounds like whataboutism to me. \s\sThis isn't a place for discussion unfortunately. This post will get down voted to shit because you guys don't want to actually have a conversation about the topic or discuss differing viewpoints you want upvotes from like minded individuals so you can get your internet boners off thinking you're on the right side and everyone agrees with you. Some sad shit. \s\s > and Trump even admitted he could tone down his rhetoric.\s\sHuh? No he didn't. He said he was going to be ""nice"" when talking about Maxine the night that it all happened because of what happened. He didn't say he was going to tone down his rhetoric. He didn't condemn previous things he's said. He did his usual shtick of blaming both sides when he couldn't pin something purely on the left. Then right away he went back to his same old shit at that same very rally. He didn't come out and condemn the lock her up chants that were happening just outside of his plane as his spokeswoman chuckled. He couldn't even fucking feign an empathetic tone as he condemns both sides for what his own supporter did.\s\sBut whatever you seem to just want to shift the blame back onto us while bitching about reddits upvote and downvote system. We get to be fucking justifiably angry at Trump for this after the shit he and his base has done to our culture. Catch Necrotizing Fasciitis you  mouth breather.Eh I'm not a fan of Whataboutism. > Whataboutism\s\sHere we just have someone pointing out a hypocrisy. For this to be Whataboutism should would need to use that hypocrisy to discredit someone on another position. \s\sAre you retarded I'm really curious to hear how the bomb mailer was a white supremacist. Haven't read the full vanifesto but I wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple swastikas SS/HHs 14/88 mixed in with the weird trump soccer team stuffI used to be Racist as FUCK and I am not white.  Who don't have to be white to be white supremacist you just have to believe that whites are superior to other races.  Thank god I grew out of it.I mean can't we just flip this around? The left seems to really enjoy ignoring Islamic terrorism as much as it can and REE's over white terrorism in the same breath. There are also all those nice ""studies"" that look at terrorism conveniently between 9/11 and the Orlando shooting so you can leave out the two biggest instances of Islamic terrorism so they can say white terrorism is worse.\s\sThis is basically saying ""heh imagine if white people did 9/11 the god damn righties wouldn't give a fuck. Now why they so mad just cause it was a bunch of muslims? heh.""It’s saying in general terrorism = bad. It doesn’t matter which group commits it. \s\sIf a Muslim were to have done this who knows what would have happened travel ban v2? If one Muslim did it then they all could...\s\sBut because a white guy did it he must have mental issues doesn’t represent the group etc...>  The left seems to really enjoy ignoring Islamic terrorism as much as it can\s\s[citation needed]Convenient studies that look at about a decade and determine that overall Islamic terrorism in the US is insignificant?

What real hard core righties would like to do is close all the public schools and fire all those unionized school teachers.  ""You want your kid educated  then get out your checkbook  because I ain't paying.""CRT just gave them a new basket in which to throw all the race baiting and fear of 'others'. It has never been taught as anything but a college level law course but now they can say that MLK the civil rights movement and the new exposure of cruelty and destruction towards Black Americans in the past is all part of it. It hurts their feelings and rather than find a way to make it right or teach that it was wrong in the first place they just want to make it illegal to teach that minorities in America have been treated horribly in the past. Whats the old saying something something doomed to repeat it? Well I am starting to think that its not what they consider doom but rather its their goal to repeat it and the only way to do that is to hide that particular history.\s\sThe hilarious part to me is here in Texas. Here we have a board that approves everything that goes into the text books. This board pushed to include that (contrary to every historian that weighed in) Moses was very influential in the founding fathers works towards the Constitution and until just a very few years ago it was still taught that many slaves were 'better off' and 'happy' with their new lot in life as slaves. Yeah that board would never approve CRT into the Texas curriculum. But now anyone who teaches that Black Americans were mistreated is now castigated with the latest greatest CRT cudgel.Most Republicans are hoping for a different end to the U.S. Civil War and WW2. They just can't handle the truth.\s#Freedom Lovers!

He should follow Hitler's lead all the time"" and then I realized how different that sounds typed out vs how I meant it in my head.Ha.  I had almost forgot about the Bunker Bitch episode.  What a long strange trip this has been.It's hard to keep trap of all the wild things he did.I still don’t recall it.Trump has this backwards. Anti-American dictators who call for the execution of people that bring the truth to light are the ones that should be executed.came here to say this… he should be treated like Mussolini: summarily shot and then hung in the town square where people can stone his corpseI would volunteer to be the one to carry out the sentence. Gladly.The fact that he's willing to execute people extrajudicially is even more reason for us to work as hard as we can to prevent him or one of his cronies from ever holding power again.  This is a fight for our lives.  If one of these fucking nazis gets power again minorities liberals Democrats and anyone who criticizes Trump could be on the crosshairs for execution by death squad.This is a selling point to most of his supporters unfortunately. Remember in 2016 when people said if Trump was elected and then lost in 2020 that he would not peacefully transfer power? And the press just normalized the guy and gave him lots of air time and called people who made predictions like that crazy lefties?Not going to happen unless the democrats eliminate the filibuster so that voting rights can be protected.\s\sThey might do it too if the progressives start making noise about the privatization being discussed for the infrastructure bill (tax neutral so the rich aren't impacted but the people are going to have to pay private tolls and deal with mismanagement not just of the privatized services but competing services as well). They won't be able to pass anything if they can't get everyone on board so we'll see how much manchin sinema and the other hateful 8 care about personal profits from privatization vs voting rights.We've known he's a little bitch ever since he had fake doctor's notes to get out of being drafted.Remember the 5 D's. Dodge Duck Dip Dive and Dodge.Meh. I can't flaw someone for not wanting to be forced into a terrorist groupHe didn't want the world to know he was a cowardly piece of shit... *and he wants to KILL someone over it*.If anyone should be executed by this country it is the traitor who directed cultists to attack the US capitol as a coup attemptAgain…<raises hand>PLOT TWIST...IT WAS MICHAEL PENCE THAT LEAKED THE BUNKER BOY INCIDENTHim wanting to hide this information means he knew he was a coward. \s\sWhat a bunker bitch.Hitler also had a bunker....Interesting that he didn't go hide in his bunker and cry like a little baby on January sixth...I mean do we have proof he didn't? He didn't make that ""We love you go home"" video until hours after the insurrection started and only after the dust was settling. I can't remember what he was doing during those hours between the rally and the video honestly.[deleted]>delivers that message right into the minds of people like a syringe\s\sYou just remind me of something. I am a bachelor in communication and the first communication model we learn is called the hypodermic needle. And is just exactly as  you said it. It's a model that suggests that information is carried unchanged from the media to the public. The figurative syringe is because as a medicine o vaccine the messenge enters the audience fast complete and without resistance.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThe catch is that model is considered obsolete and is teached only as a way to understand the propaganda machine in WW1 and 2. It's said it's obsolete because now we have an audience who is constantly in contact with many media and has the mentallity to filter messages.\s\sNow is it plausible to revive this dead model because of all the qanon/terrorists?...Ahhh so it WAS true! lololol! Then the right-wingers go on about Biden in the basement...it's ALWAYS about projection with the GQP.No no no  you don't get it. \s\sThe piece of shit is what he made in his pants that day. \s\sHe is not a piece of shit he is an asshole.He thinks it was a secret.This is entirely in character. A dictator Trump ~~willl~~ ~~would~~ ~~will~~ would execute leakers and staffers who failed to cover up anything tha made him look bad.If that guy actually did get the presidency-for-life and unlimited powers his supporters want for him he'd be a second Idi Amin.Should be executed?\s\sHoly shit that’s absolutely scary! \s\sThis guy is worse than any boss I ever had. And I’ve had some bad ones.The draft dodging kind of solidified the whole coward thing for me.Meanwhile 80 million citizens of trumpistan masterbate to a picture of dear leaders photoshop'ed head on rocky balboa's ripped and oiled body.....I saw one earlier of his head shopped onto The Rock's body.My area is Trump country especially north of me. I had to drive an hour north last week and the amount of Trump propaganda just grew every few miles. Although I have at least four houses within a block that have ""Trump 2024"" flags and other Trump propaganda littering their yard.I never even understood why he was embarrassed by it. When the Secret Service says it’s time to go to the bunker you don’t get a choice. He could have just said “that’s how it works” and left it at that. No one would have even questioned it. He actively TURNED it into a big deal.And then tried to turn it on Biden by claiming Joe was hiding in the basement.He’s a bunker bitch draft dodger who also turned his back on his loyal following when they tried to overthrow the government for him. Straight sold them out to avoid personal consequences. The fact these hive minded nimrods still support him is baffling. True cuckolds watching this slob fuck the country they supposedly love.We should remember that this guy’s name is Donald “Bunker Bitch” Trump like we remember the name of Brock “The Rapist” Turner. \s\sUnless someone can think of something better to call him. Maybe related to his coup attempt? How can we make that super easy to remember?Leader of the Coup Klux Klan?He is such a coward.People knew he was a coward back in Vietnam when that bitch was too afraid to serve his country he “loves so much”. Sadly just like he said “he could shoot people on main street and still get voted in” blah blah blah whatever else he said about his cult 45 members[removed]Like we didn't know he was a coward when he dodged the draft lol.[Bunker Boy - Randy Rainbow](https://youtu.be/2VBevEYELQ0)I N S P E C T I O N SSecret service ordered him to go to safe room.

You know what's really happening.Or even worse accepting that sometimes bad shit happens to you because you made poor decisions.Have you met Christianity? Mormonism? Islam? Etc. Etc.Dum dum dum dum dumThese are at least smart enough to not predict events on very specific days in the very near future.Dumb people are quick to overlook missed predictions if they are being told new predictions that matches their world view.   I used dumb because after the first or second failed predictions a normal person would stop listening to them since they missed the mark.The same way Charles Manson thrived.Because people are ignorantI used to be deep into conspiracies.  The conspiracy nut mindset is more of an identity than a set of facts.  Believing in it makes you feel special that the rest of the world is blind and brainwashed but you know what's really going on.It's a mixture of narcism stupidity racism and blind anger mixed into the leadened piles of bullshit fed by the corrupt anti-american conservatives groups.because the movement is made up of literally the dumbest humans on the planet.It’s the only way dumb people can act like they know some shit that everyone else doesn’t.Because people are fucking morons.Because when conservatives push misinformation they don't care if it is true or not. And they're united by their hatred for anyone who isn't them. That's why they love Trump so much he hates the same people they do. He even hates Trumpers and they hate themselves so it works out.Dunning-Kruger EffectBecause they can find a way to explain why the prophecy in question didn’t come true. The bar can be raised or lowered at any time for any reason.Because too many people have shit for brains.It’s really because there are too many people glorifying politicians. These QAnon types identify AS not WITH Donald Trump whether they want to admit it or not. They take anything negative happening to Trump as an attack on themselves so they sugar coat it the way we all do when something negative happens through coping mechanisms.Followers of prophetic cults have a tendency to double down when the prophecies don't come through. Some sort of combo of a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance and the sunk cost fallacy. William Miller predicted Christ's return in 1844. There are currently more than 21000000 adventists in the world. Go figure.Because stupid mother truckers...Why works religion?\s#Freedom Lovers!

Alex wouldn’t shut up about it. It was all very much out in the open.Right! Alex Jones was on video January 6 in Dc bragging about it![removed]Doesn't make it any less valid. \s\s*also yes I know I'm arguing with a bot it's like being in r/NewsDoes the fact that he was almost certainly lying about receiving his marching orders from Trump reduce his culpability at all? Jones is a clout-chaser and I have to assume that he was making it up considering that Trump didn't appear on his show much after the election. I think some of Trump's handlers must have kept him away from Jones or Trump et al had used up all the purpose he had for Jones and ghosted him.\s#Freedom Lovers!

Why would this be any different?> Isn't it literally a thing already to subpoena phone records in court cases? Why would this be any different?\s\sThere is no legal difference.  This is the congress not a court of law but the subpoena powers of congress are equal to that of the US DoJ.\s\sLike I said the traitors are getting nervous.I think she’s conflating two issues - either on purpose to mislead her base or accidentally because she’s too stupid to understand what she’s talking about. \s\sAs I understand it the committee doesn’t (yet) have a subpoena.  So as an alternative they **could** just issue a request to the various communications companies to voluntarily hand over the data now and skip the need for getting a judge to sign off on it first. If they asked that and the companies went along with it then there would arguably be a conversation to be had around the potential privacy implications (if they’re willing to hand over the data to these guys without a subpoena then who knows who else they’re giving it to etc) - and by the sounds of it this is the conversation MTG is trying to have now essentially claiming that the committee has made this request and the companies involved are considering whether or not to give up the data. \s\sThe problem of course is that that **isn’t** what’s actually happening. What the committee has actually done is reached out to the relevant companies and said something to the effect of “hey we’re gonna be applying for a subpoena for some of this stuff so we’d appreciate if y’all could make sure not to delete it before we get there” - a totally reasonable (and routine) request that doesn’t get anywhere near the straw man what MTG is arguing with. \s\sThe concern is that by getting in this early they’re continuing to nurture the seeds with their base that all of these companies were in on The Steal so that when they do eventually comply with a subpoena Tucker et al can call back to how they voluntarily breached everyone’s privacy etc and bury the fact that this is an entirely normal legal process even further.Something something if you don't have anything to hide  something about why would it matter?

Never forget that the ""clarity"" is disingenuously half-assedly performed in full knowledge of its insincerity and with willful intent to make it as *fleeting* as fucking possible.\s\sRemember that the hypocrisy is a *feature* of fascism not a bug.  And those who give others a pass for it are *no different* than the ones who practice it outright:  Particularly since they take turns being the front-man.  Apologism and tolerance for fascists is itself fascism.The fact the entire political sphere isn't just expected but encouraged to treat right wingers with kiddie gloves is astounding.\s\sThere is no hope for these people. They are coddled children who throw a fit the moment anything doesn't cater to them.\s\sAnd what's worse the amount of money backing their lack of ideology is so staggering that the best propaganda money can buy is to suggest that left leaning people are ""just the same.""\s\sWanting to improve the living conditions for impoverished Americans and wanting people to have the financial security necessary to become members of the polity so that we can move forward together is not the same as being some shitheel in the middle of Wyoming upset that his sheep don't get to vote and throwing a tantrum anytime anyone Mexican is treated with basic human dignity.If a Democrat single-handedly solved global warming ended wars in the Middle East and turned every authoritarian state into a perfect liberal democracy they'd still be criticized for taking too long.\s\sIf a Republican pushed 4 orphans off of a bridge instead of 5 they get a goddamn national monument.Prodigal Son story friendAh the cost of being educated.Can't have said it better myself.Imagine instead of upholding america you got fucked by a stupid ugly fat fascist. Republicans and their ideology is a threat to humanity.This gave me a very unpleasant mental image lolKeep these articles going. The fash are getting triggered.Those heroes were just rats escaping a flood. Republicans don't have morals.Not even trying to escape.  What they're doing is a *feint* intended to make you believe that they want to escape because it further destroys the discourse and derails it into a piece of #NotAllFascists fuckwaddery.>the one thing we should recall from Watergate is that the heroes of Watergate were Republicans who would not tolerate Richard Nixon’s conduct.\s\sYeah right! They appointed him their leader in the first place...Trump too!\s\sGetting rid of them is your responsibility not a triumph.There were no Republican “heroes” in the Watergate affair. A few of them grudgingly opposed Nixon out of self-interest or to protect the future of the GOP.I've honestly given up hope that Trump will ever face justice for his crimes. The US  is absolutely broken.I've known for a long time that he's not going to face justice.  He's not even going to be mildly inconvenienced. 😒Usually I'm not one for conspiracies. One which I've nonetheless found to be a compelling narrative (though still one lacking in evidence to my knowledge) relates to Watergate. Nixon's ""White House Plumbers"" had been established to prevent further leaks of information after the publishing of the ""Pentagon Papers"" which detailed illegal activities conducted by US intelligence agencies and the military in Vietnam. The plumbers also engaged in a number of other activities such as the break-in at the Watergate Hotel. The conspiracy theory here is that during the Watergate investigations some of the information the White House Plumbers had stopped from leaking came to Congress' attention and that whatever that information was happened to be spicy enough that the threat of Democrats leaking it to the press was enough to get Republicans to agree to the impeachment and conviction of Nixon. The actual nature of this information is where this theory really goes into the realm of conspiracy as everything from CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination to COINTELPRO and MKUltra to US War Crimes to corrupt dealings by other Republicans are alleged as being the blackmail used to ensure Republican cooperation. If this theory is true (which it may or may not be) it might point to the ""missing ingredient"" lacked by the Trump impeachment which was a failure when compared to the Nixon impeachment.Yeah we don’t have any of those anymoreI find it funny how Trump has been calling fraud for months but in the end he's the one asking Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" votes like there's caches of Trump votes hidden around like lego star wars minikits.the AG should've jebaited him by requesting that Trump have his people send ballots to him.Perdue went on Fox News to say the AG of Georgia should be ashamed of himself for taping and leaking a recording of a sitting president. \s\s\s#Perdue is a seditious imbecile! Vote him out this weekHonestly watching this from the outside makes me wonder how America got to be this way.  \s\s\sWas it insane from the get-go?[deleted]I wish the pla would liberate america/sAnd now republicans either support it or don’t care.Welcome to /r/MarchAgainstNazis!

If this is true…let that sink in. Those in leadership positions helping an attempted coup. No other language or explanation allowed.That’s exactly what happened.  We watched a lot of it in reporting prior to Jan 6 and that day.  That’s what bothers me about the lack of prosecution of the organizers…there is a boatload of probable cause.The ones who were in Congress and the White House that helped plan it need to be hung.

Call me pessimistic but until we change the culture of propaganda and dark money in this country corruption is just going to get worse and worseHow does one push back against decades of propaganda? I believe it's possible I simply don't know where it starts.At this point it’s not even just about holding Trump accountable but the entirety of the GOP who enabled this shit show for years and continues to do so. \s\sThe party deserves no mulligans and its high profile politicians should be shamed in public every time they step out. They need to beg forgiveness or be tossed from civil society. Taking a centrists approach to this will just lead to situations much much much worse in 2022 and 2024.All that plus the Republican hate-machine: Fox News Rush L Alex J etc. etc.So much agreed.  We are a fucking country.   Not two.  Country first.   Not party first.   I wish there more republican politicians that felt that way.> At this point it’s not even just about holding Trump accountable but the entirety of the GOP who enabled this shit show for years and continues to do so.\s> \s> The party deserves no mulligans and its high profile politicians should be shamed in public every time they step out.

The Dems will just let it all go.\s\s> Taking a centrists approach to this will just lead to situations much much much worse in 2022 and 2024.\s\sIf Trump is still alive in 2024 he will run again and he will *win*.>They need to beg forgiveness or be tossed from civil society.\s\sFuck forgiveness. I don't care if the cancer apologizes it still has to be removed.They're already playing ""nothing to see here"" Please let's not forget the GOP has fucked the Dems for the last 4 years....just look at the pieces of legislation rotting on his desk.\s\sThey need to be held responsible;  with Biden I don't think so but have some hopes regarding Harris - now is the time to be the tough prosecutor She is known for.Treason is not exclusive to the traitor -- it also applies to all those who've supported them.\s\sCentrism is complicity.My personal adage has always been ""You have to be losing big in order to win big"" we just managed to come out of 4 years of the worst America has to offer as bad as the damage that was done is we all were stealing ourselves for another round of his bullshit. It could have gone that way worse still it could have gone that way by some extra-legal means. Imagine Pence having gone along imagine if martial law had been declared imagine one or several states caving and saying ""Sure lets run another election"". The point is American Democracy was on the ropes and getting pummeledand she survived. I've been telling my sons that this has been a test of our republic of our democracy of our values as a country. Biden's win and inauguration is a very big and hopeful sign that we may have passed the test and what happens to the insurrectionist's within the government and without will be the final part of this test. They cannot walk there must be consequences or we will have failed the test.Like how for decades joint smokers and dime baggers(yea-so i'm old) were sent to jails and prisons for their crimes under the greatest democracy with its credo of 'Rule of Law' while tobacco ceo's lied in front of the senate concerning the effects of nicotine and how many served time or were even personally fined? None of course.  Fine the persona of the 'corporation' and pass the costs to the consumer and as tax- writeoffs...Guess we're paying uptrump has done the worst to us so far.  He needs to be held accountable.  That’s how we move forward.  And that’s how we heal.No there won't be a high price. The cost will be total. \s\sAmerica is dead if he's not held accountable. It will be perfectly clear that the President is completely above the law and they won't have to spend years testing those waters next time.> It will be perfectly clear that the President is completely above the law and they won't have to spend years testing those waters next time.\s\sOnly if the president is a Repug.Not a single president in US history has served jail time after being in office for any reason. Trump is by no means the first criminal president. Nothing will change because Trump isn't even anything fucking new.Welcome to /r/MarchAgainstNazis! Looking for like-minded subreddits?!

The word does EXACTLY the thing that it purports to avoid.[deleted]This is why helping to get out the vote is so important.His argument about “protecting our own voters” makes zero sense. GOP voters are the preferred voters in basically every way under the current system.I read protect their voters from their own broader suppression.Party of victim mentality.We already saw this with the primary. It's so fucked up!!Remember. Electoralism is a Hobby and nothing more. Your praxis should not involve asking the oppressors to be good on their terms.Republicans are so gross.Quickly followed up by an angry tweet demanding all White House staffers and loyalists have all verbal conversations in a faraday cage.We are so so fucked.The fix is in.https://youtu.be/8GBAsFwPglwNormal countryEven if my vote will make a microscopic impact I still believe I should vote. If its rigged ok then just more ammumition to bring em down with once we have turned the tables. Plus I find it ironic that everyone was in panic over russian interference but no one is worried about interference from within our own country. The world is more messed up than the people in picasso's paintings.Republicans like to convince themselves that Democrats are constantly cheating so that they feel justified in cheating themselves. The problem is that they have found any modern presidential campaigns that featured Demcratic cheating but nearly all have featured Republican cheating.\s\sGrag Palast's book ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"" details the steps that Florida Governor Jeb Bush took to throw the election in favor of his idiot brother in 2000. It started before the election by generously purging the voter rolls in primarily Democratic counties and continued after the election when the Republicans used a little known law about challenging votes to challenge thousands of Democratic votes in Democratic counties while challenging very few Republican votes. Those challenges were not investigated or answered just thrown out for no reason other than the Republican party challenged them for unknown reasons. People who had voted and thought their votes counted had their votes tossed out for no reason completely unbeknownst to them. There were other schemes like disappearing ballots etc.\s\sThat has become the basic playbook for voter suppression and it continues in every Republican election. To this day nearly every important election in Florida is won by Republicans and by a razor thin margin. \s\sThat playbook is now being used in other Republican states and they have added plenty of other tricks as well (closing of polls in Democratic leaning areas non-counting of absentee and mail-in ballots non-mailing of mail in ballots etc.).\s\sOn one of his recent interviews on Fox News Trump railed against the concept of election becoming mail in only saying that Republicans would never win another election. If your party can't win when EVERYONE votes then perhaps your party needs to alter their agenda.Rush Limbaugh was encouraging voters in California and Chicago to ignore stay at home orders because they'd already crossed over into ""herd immunity.""  The locales aren't random... he has an intense hatred for the ""Democrat Party"" in California and Chicago.  And he wants to see how many people he can kill apparently.\s\sHe's on PUBLIC airwaves too!  Can anyone tell me why we allow propagandists who are actively trying to kill Americans on our PUBLIC airwaves?  Is the a First Amendment thing?  He has the god-given right to try to kill use because... well just because?So what? Everybody knows (or should know) there is voter supprssion. Both in the general and in democratic primaries. And most people don't give a fuck.I don’t think people know actually. I think people are unaware outside of the lies and racist delusions Trump spinsAnd you’re going to do nothing about it.

Many GOP voters were caught directly participating in election fraud include elected officials as well as GOP voters who voted for dead parents or in one high-profile case murdered his wife (suspected but c'mon) and then voted for her.\s\shttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/15/man-suspected-wifes-death-cast-ballot-her-name-court-docs-say/5108597001/**G**aslight **O**bstruct ***P****roject*.\s\sThe real meaning of the GOPCommitted by a person named Tiny Peters 🤣As with every other catchphrase they spout it turns out “Stop The Steal” was a confession not a rallying cry.Every fraud is pro Trump too amazing.Don’t get it wrong here. She is one of the people claiming fraud happened. So she turned off the cameras let an unauthorized individual in to take pictures and was hiding. Basically she is trying to prove fraud by being fraudulent. And some of the people here eat it up like candy.>""Peters denies wrongdoing in the data leak the breach is now the subject of investigations by local state and federal investigations. And Peters is nowhere to be found. Last week Lindell told Vice that he was helping Peters hide in an undisclosed location (originally Texas he said but she has since moved due to security concerns)""\s\sIt's obvious Mike Lindell is on self-destructive trajectory. If the grifters around him don't clean him out Dominion will. Obstruction of justice charges may put him in prison. How does somebody come up with such an effective business model (it's fucking pillow fer chrissakes) and still be so damn stupid?How?   That’s easy….Ego\s\sHe was right about one thing (a pillow can make money) and now his ego says he is right about *all the things by proxy*\s\sYou are seeing glaring examples of how success causes idiocy.  \s\sIt’s how we get rock stars and actors saying stupid shit about things they have no inkling or background in.  Or producing products. Or just being assholes when someone says to stay in their own lane.\s\sIt’s also how we got a jackass in a position of power think he was a: military expert weatherman medical expert economics expert foreign relations expert etc etc when time and again he wasn’t very apparently and very loudly.  \s\sI won’t name names but I bet you can draw a conclusion here if you tried.To be fair it took me years to find the right type of pillow for how I sleep.\s\sFrom what I can see his pillows aren’t it.Just racking up counts of obstruction of justice> Obstruction of justice charges may put him in prison.\s\sNah none of these people are going to jail.\s\sUnfortunately. 😒>How does somebody come up with such an effective business model (it's fucking pillow fer chrissakes) and still be so damn stupid?\s\sEnh... A person can be good at some things (making and selling bedding stuff) and not so good at others (being a good person/sane political advocate).Sounds like aiding and abetting to me.Imagine participating in a breach of a federal database looking for discrepancies/fraud and you don’t find any. What do you do😂 is it just like an “oh fuck” moment?It's like Book of Mormon just double down on your beliefs and everything will be fine.Right then instead of trying to cover it up and hide it one of you goes on a coast to coast tour talking about it.Bold of you to assume:\s1. She's capable of introspection\s2. She's capable of admitting fault\s3. Won't just readjust her conspiracy to preserve her worldview and identity built around that conspiracyAh there's some fraud!The election fraud is coming from *inside* the house!I bet the FBI knows where Tina Peters is. If she's used her own phone or credit cards once since she went to ground they've got her. She's not that clever.Lol man I’m basically a jr bsa/aml guy at my bank I always try to get tellers to ask what’s going on when it’s certain amounts of cash out and people are always saying they don’t want the irs to know. It’s like man you’re cashing a check from a business for 11k and depositing a little to avoid a ctr like that matters you think the business isn’t also reporting what they paid you or what? People are fucking dumb.In  Wa State we have a GOP sec of state. Sec of states oversee voting in states; that's how for example Kemp became Governor of Georgia. He was sec of state and set up the voting system that disallowed Abrams her victory as governor. During 2020 I worked for the D candidate.  The R sec of state was the incumbent. Ppl activist type ppl would say to me ""but R is one of the good Republicans"".  Of course the ""good Republican"" was elected and of course Latino voters in rural areas of the state had their ballots disallowed bc their ""signatures didn't match those on file."" Which caused Rs to win elections by small numbers and caused lawsuits. \s\sIn short never ever vote for the GOP candidate for your state's sec of state.  Their loyalty isn't to the Republic its to the weird GOP party.Governor Kemp and his state capitol cops should be in prison for attempting to frame Park Cannon for assaulting a police officer.  Video evidence proved that was a lie.  For me just dropping charges won't do.  Brian Kemp needs charged for false testimony and voter intimidation.  Oh and I know all about him stealing the election from Abrams.There is no such thing as a ""good Republican"". The only way they might look good is if you compare them to primary challengers which will always be to the right of them and more radical.Just a reminder that Peters is in Lauren Boebert's district.\s\sThe very same Lauren Boebert that underreported her husband's income by like a million bucks on her FEC forms.\s\sYeah THOSE were the votes Peters was counting.No surprise.  I mean they talk about fraud and then it comes up that there was fraud!  Like when someone used their dead mother's vote for Trump because ""that's who she would have voted for!"" or the guy killing his wife and using her vote for Trump.  Don't forget the guys in the Hummer with bags of ballots all for Trump!  \s\sSure there's fraud...but it's not the fraud you are looking for.Have they updated the dead mother vote since [this](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Pennsylvania-Lt-Gov-Fetterman-relentlessly-15822777.php)?So Lindell made a fortune selling pillows and today he's hiding a fugitive and is facing a serious lawsuit that will wipe his entire fortune away because he wants Donald Trump to be president again. Er should someone get a urine sample from this guy?How about that Mike found fraud after allThese people have the mentality of “I would commit fraud for what I want so they must be doing it too!” They don’t get it that more people wanted tRump outIt's pretty much their MO with everything.  This is one of the reasons why all of their fantasies about ""socialists"" putting them in FEMA camps and executing them with 50-person guillotines inside of three-tiered railroad cars stored on spurs in the upper midwest before taking them to the Amtrak yards in Indianapolis where the Deep State has secretly built a giant crematorium terrify me so much.I'm questioning this whole narrative of Lindell ""hiding"" this gal. So you're telling me a national public figure who appears on some talk show somewhere every day is in no way trying to keep a low profile and apparently keep no secret about hiding this lady can't be picked up by LE for hiding a fugitive?\s\sEither he's lying or this gal really isn't ""wanted""That's an interesting thought. The FBI is notorious for moving slowly not through incompetence but because they're exceedingly thorough. That doesn't explain why state or local officials haven't subpoenaed him or issued an arrest warrant if he's defying a subpoena.\s\sMy only guess is that at this stage Peters is a ""person of interest"". I haven't seen anybody reporting on an arrest warrant or indictment for her yet. I have no idea what the threshold is for ""obstruction of justice"" and whether Lindell can be brought up on charges for assisting her in avoiding these investigations but the way Lindell is publicly talking about hiding her is a stupidly exposed position to put himself in.  \s\sI love the irony that Lindell is openly supporting somebody who stands credibly accused of undermining elections she was charged to protect. I'm also damn glad to see Ron Watkins getting roped into this mess. 😃LE doesn't always pick up suspects immediately. Sometimes they wait and watch so they can scope out the rest of the network.\s\sAs I said in another comment on this post I suspect the FBI knows where she is.FBI covers all their bases. It might look slow but when they bring you in… well there aren’t many loop holes left open.To date there are many verified instances of 2020 ""voting fraud"" however I have yet to see any attributed to a Democratic party member.Texas Lt. Gov. Patrick still owes Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Fetterman three million bucks for catching dead mothers voting~  https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Pennsylvania-Lt-Gov-Fetterman-relentlessly-15822777.phpSo the election was fraudulent because of the machines?  but reality says that PEOPLE voted twice PEOPLE hid and threw ballots away and statistics show it was REPUBLICAN PEOPLE that did all the fraudulent things. SmhTurns out the fraud that Lindell has been searching for so tirelessly was ~coming from inside the house~How do you think he came up with his irrefutable evidence?Harboring a material witness or potential felon. Good luck in prison Mike. You'll need some of your pillows to bite.HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Pillow biter.The dude faces more serious charges than she does.  Sedation can get you hung.  He's going for broke.  They all are.You see that fucking mustache? Does that look like someone who’s going to be the bitch? LolOh look more election fraud by Republicans. I'm so surprised. Look at how shocked I am.Peters needs to come out of the mypillow fort and face the consequences!Man they keep yelling “Fraud fraud security fraud!”  But it’s all republicans performing it. \s\sMaybe we should ban them from over seeing elections.It's projection.They imagine it happening so they can justify doing it.Mike Lindell operates a safe house for criminals?  Is he hiding her in his neighbor's medicine cabinet?Isn't that called Harboring a Fugitive?She isn't a fugitive until indicted. AFAIK that hasn't happened yet.They should go find her and put her in jail. But it’s entirely likely that absolutely nothing will happenNear to harboring a fugitive? Federal crime if indictment handed down?Grifters gonna griftThe safe house is made of my pillowsYou have quite the pillow collection then.They couldn't even cheat to win. Pathetic.Boebert won.Ooh! I remember her! She was involved in that ""cyber symposium"" in denial when Ron Watkins most likely Q got a call from his lawyer [stating that the data he was looking at was likely from stolen hard drives](https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1425543921166397446?s=20) and Tina Peters jumped in to say that totally didn't happen. \s\sI can't tell if this is actually related but it is regarding hard drives from the same county she was working in it appears.Did you ever notice that these hard-line trump thumpers all look like 40 miles of bad road?  Like 10 - 20 years older than they actually are?  Look at KellyAnne Marjorie Taylor Greene Cindy Hyde Smith on and on.  \s\sIt's almost like having such a rotten soul presents physically.  Skanks one and all.Tina is going to be going through some thingsAnd still…that county's voters wouldn’t recall her.Oooooh yeah.  A ""safe house"" because there are mobs of angry voters after her...the made up and endlessly trumpeted fear outrage and persecution fetishism of these mooks knows no limit.Tina and Mike are holed up in a motel 6 breaking blinds and staining every towel in that room with burnt brillo. I hope they have funSo she’s the one that stole the hard drives or whatever?Safe  house from who?One day maybe we can stop pretending that when it comes to politics and criminals in politics there's never any reason to look anywhere other than the Republican Party.A republican committing fraud? Whoa I’m shockedVOTE LIKE YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT.The ball is droppingIt was the demon rats who stole the election   not the other way around. \s\sWhat's wrong with being patriotic. What's wrong with having right of center political beliefs. It is not inherently bad evil or wrong to have right of center political beliefs. \s\sTrump is running in three years time. A mistake he is an old man. And he lost. The Republicans need to put their red hats on and come up with a new Presidential hopeful someone that is below the retirement age. Someone with a good brain. Someone who can deal on the International/Global stage. \s\sThe current president is laughing stock. The former president is a laughing stock. It's not right for the most important / most powerful country in the world. \s\sPersonally I am looking forwards to China's rise and rise. America has not done a good job of n1 superpower. America's foreign policy stinks of stinky ass. America has invaded and occupied an endless stream of countries almost all of invasions and occupations wrong and unjust. \s\sKamalla could swoop in to take the top job from Geriatric Joe but I don't want that either. \s\sIn the private world of big company CEO's you have a competent person at the top but in American politics you have grossly unsuitable people  running on both sides of the fake left-right paradigm.> It was the demon rats who stole the election not the other way around.\s\sAnd yet every instance of election fraud found happened in states where Republicans won.\s\sAnyway you have a British username why are you all-in on the pro-GOP bullshit?Nothing is wrong with being a true conservative. The republican party today is nothing close to conservative. They're straight up fascists now. Patriotic is fine and good. Crazy nationalists is what Republicans today are. Republicans are extremely far right of center now. Joe Biden is right of center. If the Republicans put a right of center candidate up for election they'd win today but they can't do that because they've painted themselves into a corner with their ideology now and can only give us their next big hope DeSantis.Learn to write first.When they find someone with more than half a brain and one iota of empathy by all means let us know.lol what a loserI thought Dominion systems with remote login were incorrectly counting all the incorrectly counted votes.60 lawsuits lost about all the election BS.

They excuse this behavior because they have convinced themselves “the left does it anyway”That's been very obvious for awhile now. Over and over we watched the Trump administration play this game of accusing other people of doing exactly what they were doing. It's predictable now.I’ve also heard that they believe the left fakes ballots. Because in their mind 81 million people would never want Biden as President. So that must mean massive amounts of fake ballots/votes.I have a close friend who was raised in an evangelical republican household. He was telling me about how the presidential election was stolen and I asked him for evidence. He couldn't come up with anything tangible. Just some ""well I know"" and ""people have said"" ramblings. So I told him about how republican groups were putting fake ballot collection boxes up in large cities in California that vote primarily blue. He didn't believe me. Shocker I know. So when I got home I sent him links to the articles from several different reputable news sites videos of the police removing them and interviews with the republican group leaders that put the boxes out.     \s  \sMy friend literally said ""Well that just proves that the democrats are doing stuff.""It is true that every election there are legitimate cases of voter fraud.  they're just never significant enough to matter beyond local races.\s\sWhat is it these people think they're making ""great again""?  In a great country every vote counts.  In a ""great"" country we encourage and support even the people we don't like getting to the ballot box.  We don't game the system by gerrymandering voter suppression laws or like this piece of shit deciding she had the moral authority to deny franchise to people she disagrees with.\s\sIt has to be worth it.  It has to matter.  Otherwise we're just ""grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit"" (to quote a philosopher of great renown.)Yeah this just made me think of the average individual who would commit voter fraud.

Obama tapped the wires too. Obviously.Lol. Not bad.  Here’s what he said via his spokesperson \s\sThis is disgusting. It’s fake news just like RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA was fake news. It’s just the Radical Left crazies doing whatever they can to demean everybody on the right.\s\s“It’s fiction and nobody was tougher on Russia than me including on the pipeline and sanctions. At the same time we got along with Russia. Russia respected us China respected us Iran respected us North Korea respected us.\s\s“And the world was a much safer place than it is now with mentally unstable leadership.”Just remember this 'leak' serves Putin's interest too.\s\sNot as much as keeping Trump in the White House would have but silver linings everywhere.*unfair*\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSeems to be his favorite word these days.It is fake news to cover up the fraud votes in az and gaOoh!\s\s*Kompromat* has a fairly specific meaning in Russian intelligence parlance.\s\sIt can be political financial sexual or a few other types but it's *always* blackmail fodder and they probably have all different kinds of this on half the GQP.\s\sI always wondered what made an old tightass like McConnell go with Trailer Trash Trump but his wife has those China connections...I find it difficult to believe any political or financial *kompromat* would stick to Trump and neither would infidelity or the fabled *pee tape*. Seriously if anything these past years have shown us is that Trump can do or say almost anything and get away with it.\s\sRaping minors might however and has been alluded to in many instances - from his own comments of “liking them on the young side” to many accounts from his beauty pageants to his connection to Epstein and the testimony by Jane Doe who claims Trump raped her at 13 (retracted after threats to her family were made).\s\sThere’s simply too much smoke for there not to be a fire and it’s been evident for years that Putin has very strong *kompromat* on Trump.\s\sEdit: I would like to add that I’m baffled a US president can be so obviously beholden to a foreign hostile power and not be held for treason. We might speculate about what the *kompromat* is but US intelligence would surely know exactly what it is. So how did we get this far? Is the truth more damaging than the traitor in this instance?What they didn't leak is that the Kremlin probably has kompromat on a bunch of other Republican senators and representatives. It's really the only way to explain why so many Republican politicians continue to back him while he does so much damage.Yes just like the Steele DossierWARNING: Luke Harding is a well-known liar.Most of the security people (and a good deal of the  left) that I follow think this is like Bush's national guard docs - it's fake documentation about stuff that really happened used to discredit an actual truthful documentation.   \s\s\sAnd ones of the authors of the article has been fed/believed lies before.Sx3 243dThis is the most no shit ""revelation"".Goes without saying Russia's got dirt on Trump. But good to have some validation.I love how everyone thinks that Russia aided Trumps victory. Maybe it's the fact that people shared the same values as Trump. Let's see remember when Hilary could barely fill a small gym of supporters that camera crews had to angle it just right to make it seem like the room was full when a third party takes a pic and it shows about 250 people in a capacity of about 1000. While on the other hand Trump could easily have on average 10k to 25k supporters at a rally.Why is there this obsession with crowd sizes. I will never be the kind of dipshit goober that stands in the rain to clap for a politician acting their own interests. Stop embarrassing yourself.I mean Russia DOES share the same  values as Trump. Totalitarianism wants to overthrow US elections hates freedom of the press loves corruption endorses violence  against political enemies.  \s\s\sSo glad you can see that.That's like literally every day here in Austin.

Let the January 6 committee keep digging. \s\sOf course if this can be brought to light live and in prime time that would be nice too.In this case? Prosecute them.Let Rona do her thing.Motherfuckin Dyer's official response to the media is legit just ""b-b-b-b-but you're supposed to be distracted by Biden!"" Lmao.Hope he wore his brown pants.“I find it highly hypocritical that everyone is focusing on the smoking gun in my hand and fresh corpse at my feet when meanwhile medical malpractice kills not just one but *thousands* of Americans per year!”Thanks OP - I just read this too.\s\sFucking wow.  It's the greatest hits of 'congress members who are resisting phone record requests'.They're probably also gonna really turn up the 'Fauci's killing puppies' bs this week.**Excuse me what the fuck**And there's a sizeable list of names dropped.Well put!> detailed a stunning series of allegations to Rolling Stone including a **promise of a “blanket pardon”** from the Oval Office\s\sSo... did anyone hear back on that?\s\sEDIT: saw the full article and it’s even worse. It’s not about the organizers wanting pardons for January 6th it’s that the organizers *already* had legal issues and had the understanding Trump would pardon them for *past* crimes if they put together a good Capitol protest.What? Oh God no we said blanket *party*!The question is: Will CNN _et al_ cover this like they did the withdrawal of Afghanistan? I don’t mean just report on it but drill it into everyone’s heads 24/7 for weeks?Yes.\s\sAs a foreigner I was glued to CNN for weeks after Jan 6th (I was watching their coverage of the count that day) and their shows were nothing but ""Republicans need to be held accountable for this"" up until last time I tuned into CNN which was a few weeks ago.So both Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs are listed as participating in these planning sessions and I honestly can't say I'm surprised.  I remember the shit-eating grins on both Andy Biggs and Majorie Taylor Greene in one of the photos from January 6th it looked like they knew what was going on and were just gleeful as could be.  \s\sI really hope AZ can kick both of those idiots to the curb next year.Perhaps the biggest story about the insurrection a d they put it behind a paywall? Well okay then.\s\sHere's a nonpaywall\shttps://theweek.com/donald-trump/1006364/2-jan-6-rally-organizers-say-they-will-implicate-gop-members-of-congress-in\s\s\sIf anything and I mean anything happens to these people up to and including a freak accident that is automatically an admission of guilt.“J6 organizers didn’t kill themselves”Sorry bout that. I was so excited to be able to share this I didn't consider the paywall. Thank you for the link!Oooh this is going to get interesting! That's conspiracy right there.\s\sThey can probably charge them on RICO.And each individual meeting would be one count right?Its awful to think but I genuinely think nothing will come of it. Sweet fuck all and it will inspire and reinforce the notion to try it again.It's understandable and very easy to think this way. A couple of things to remember though is that 1. Investigations like these just take time. If even one thing is rushed it could ruin the entire case (though I do also wish they put the spurs to things). 2. Regardless of what the cheeto huffers say and do rules and laws still matter. And 3. It is the frustration into inaction that the likes of Traitor Queen and the others count on to continue their shit show. \s\sAgain feel the frustration but try not to live in it. Also remind your D reps and senators is past time they start swinging more hammer.I hope the January 6th Committee is doing a thorough deep dive into who each Specific legislator talked to and what they talked about. Im sure most had conversations with organizers but we really need to know if any of them went specifically into any sort of planning of the actual invasion and if any of the legislators had the idea in mind of the process being stopped that day by the crowd. If so they need to be immediately expelled from Conogress and brought up on charges.I'm sure that's exactly what they're looking into.\s\sIf there's one good thing about social media it's that many of these dodos including reps and senators left many a breadcrumb that can be retrieved and scrutinized.They’re turning on each other!\s\sOn a serious note I hope the journalism here is better fact checked and sourced than the campus-rape article from several years ago.  The last thing we need is to have this turn out to be fake sources.  Seems like RS is doing its homework this time though.of course they are turning one one another one of their real principles is ""i am going to get to be at the top and i'll knock the ladder down to prevent me from sharing it with anyone else even as i try to climb it""\s\sthese people would betray family if they felt it would advance status.So this is why some of them were so convinced trump was going specifically pardon them.\s\sNothing short of treason. If we don’t hold them accountable we are seriously done as a country. It was a nice run but like the Romans greed did us in.Hard to trust rolling stone since they published that BS article about overflowed hospitals in OKAs an Arizonan I am pleased there will be two empty seats in the House to fill in a state increasingly blue.Russian spooks got Drumph to a T  “mentally unstable”  “most promising candidate” and worst of all “impulsive mentally unstable and unbalanced individual who suffers from an inferiority complex”. Ouch.This would help bring about Russia’s favoured “theoretical political scenario”. A Trump win “will definitely lead to the destabilisation of the US’s sociopolitical system” and see hidden discontent burst into the open it predicts.\s\s-Mission AccomplishedAlso \s\s""There are paragraphs on how Russia might insert “media viruses” into American public life which could become self-sustaining and self-replicating. These would alter mass consciousness especially in certain groups it says."" \s\sWorked better than any of them could have hoped.Are we causing even a fraction of the domestic chaos in Russia that they are causing here?  And if no why the hell not?We already did it to them they learned from it and are now crushing us with some of the same tactics that buried the ussrCan't undermine their democracy if they don't have one.

They would kill themselves their souls would be picked up by the passing spaceship and reach eternal Bliss. Now when they were following up on the actions of now dead cult members they found a handful bought a high powered telescope. It was returned the very next day. The manager said they claimed the telescope was broken. When he asked how they replied"" it could pick up the comet clearly but we couldn't see the spaceship in the tail. Obviously it's the lenses."" Seeing as how he was dealing with crazies he just gave them a refund and sent them on their way. People can see proof with their own eyes but would rather die than admit they were wrongHeaven's Gate actually was made around the assumption that the leaders Marshall Applewhite [Do]  and Bonnie Nettles [Ti] were aliens in human form who were tasked with bringing peace to earth. \s\s Then Nettles died and Applewhite went completely off the rails. He was a closet homosexual and his hatred of his Sexuality would lead him having himself castrated which many of his blind devotional followers did as well toward the end Applewhite had predicted that a spaceship carrying Nettles would be coming for them however several failed predictions occurredin the interim. It wasn't until radio host Art Bell started the conspiracy theory of a UFO behind the comet and presented a photo of the supposed UFO on television  that Heaven's Gate specifically attached themselves to the Hale Bop comet.At this point so many of these people have lost family friends & jobs as well as probably put themselves in crippling debt over this they literally have nothing else.This...if Q cost them everything they have to sink their heels in and hope there's a payoff else they must face how they fucked up their own lives for nothing.Sunk cost fallacy\s\sThey have invested too much to be wrong.\s\s\sWHY DOES THE QANON CONSPIRACY THRIVE DESPITE ALL ITS UNFULFILLED PROPHECIES? \s\sWhy Does the QAnon Conspiracy Thrive Despite All its Unfulfilled Prophecies?\s\s \s\sIDEAS\s\sBY MIKE ROTHSCHILD\s\s \s\sJUNE 30 2021 7:00 AM EDT\s\sRothschild is a journalist focused on the intersections between internet culture and politics as seen through the dark glass of conspiracy theories. Since 2018 he has specialized in examining the QAnon conspiracy cult. His new book is The Storm Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement a Cult and a Conspiracy of Everything\s\sTo any reasonable person the failure of a long-foretold event to materialize should erode the belief that it will happen. A perfect example is the long-foretold and never arriving “storm” of mass arrests promised by the mysterious “military intelligence” team at the heart of the QAnon conspiracy. How could anyone think something promised for years and put off countless times is actually going to happen this time?\s\sBelief doesn’t need to be reasonable—particularly when it revolves around the punishment of the people you’ve been told are responsible for all of the world’s ills. And this stubborn lack of logic isn’t limited to people who think the deep state is trafficking children or that Joe Biden is actually a fake president. We all have an innate need to believe in good things that are extremely unlikely to take place. It’s the essence of hope. And a life without hope is . . . hopeless.\s\sEven when Q believers are presented with crushing proof that they’ve been fooled they still believe—often taking the proof that they’re wrong as proof that they’re actually right. To do otherwise would be to give in to hopelessness.\s\sBy the time of the COVID-19 lockdown Q had been exposed countless times as a fraud and a troll with no connection to military intelligence whose “predictions” were the same kind of rapid-fire guessing that a strip-mall psychic uses while the movement’s members were running into the law for their increasingly violent and untethered behavior. But to the faithful these were all temporary setbacks perpetrated by a bought-and-paid-for media. Everyone just needed to “trust the plan” and believe.\s\sTo understand why QAnon followers believe and hang on to that belief requires understanding why people believe in conspiracy theories in the first place. To begin Q is almost never anyone’s first conspiracy theory but the next step on a ladder that includes any number of plots and schemes. So when people find Q which already incorporates so many other conspiracy theories it easily fits into their world view. And it doesn’t mean they’re crazy or stupid.\s\sHuman brains need to recognize dangerous situations and we are hardwired to seek patterns to find order in chaos and to exert control where none can be found. Conspiracy theories at their most basic level assert that we are in danger from hidden forces. This helps give difficult questions and random events satisfying answers—and puts us at the center of those events. And we all do it.\s\sIf you’re hearing danger in a strange noise late at night or looking at a world event and thinking that there must be more to it than what we’re being told you’re just doing what your brain has evolved to do as a way to make sense of the senseless.\s\sOur lives are often full of failure—personal professional and collective. We don’t want to believe these failures are due to honest mistakes by others or random chance. And most of all we don’t want to believe that they’re our own fault. To believe otherwise is to believe that either we screwed up or that we have no control over what happens to us. And that’s just too horrible to accept.\sSuch beliefs don’t begin with the Internet nor are they more prevalent in the Internet age. Decades of polling consistently show that over half of Americans believe in some conspiracy theory and that about as many people in 1963 believed that multiple assassins killed JFK as they did in 2013 according to Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Use Them.\s\sNotions that someone is trying to get something over on us go viral for a good reason: many times someone is trying to get something over on us. Conspiracy theories can be held by people who work normal jobs have loving families and don’t spend every hour of every day soaking in violent ideation. They can take the form merely of irritating our friends with yet another ramble about whatever hidden chicanery we’ve chosen to believe in—our phone breaking suspiciously just as the service contract expires so that we have to buy a new one and so on. They can even be fun to speculate about—like the viral conspiracy theory about Chuck E. Cheese “recycling” unused pizza slices to make misshapen new pizzas.\s\sFurther complicating matters is that some conspiracies are real. Julius Caesar was murdered by Roman politicians conspiring together. A conspiracy of killers succeeded in assassinating President Abraham Lincoln with plans to kill both the Vice President and Secretary of War. A conspiracy of German officers tried to kill Adolf Hitler in July 1944. And the U.S. Public Health Service engaged in a grossly unethical four-decade conspiracy to withhold syphilis treatment from Black sharecroppers in Tuskegee Alabama.\s\sConspiracy theories on the other hand find believers because they fit in with our need to find hidden danger and revelations about how the world “really” works. As we’ve seen this is not necessarily a bad thing. But for many Q believers that nebulous feeling that they’re all out to get me becomes They’re all out to get me and I’m gonna get them first. This is the danger of Q—not that people believe it but that believing it means that those who don’t are the enemy.\s\sFor the QAnon adherent Q is not a conspiracy theory—and many believers bristle at the term calling themselves “conspiracy researchers” instead. It’s a way of clearly seeing the world and of organizing the players into columns of good guys and bad guys. And it provides its believers something nobody usually expects out of cultish conspiracy movements—hope. Q believers speak excitedly of the promise of a new future that Q would deliver—something ex-believer Jitarth Jadeja explained to me.\s\s“I wanted to believe that the good guys were fighting the good fight and in a better future” he told me over Zoom. “Q makes you feel important and gives you meaning and self-esteem. You are saving the world when you’re in Q [it’s] the highest way you can view yourself.”\s\sUndoubtedly at least some Q believers are in the grip of delusion to the point of being unable to stand trial for crimes they’ve committed. Others vaguely believe some of its tenets without specifically calling themselves Q believers. And some are just in it for the trolling—or because they really hate Jews and Democrats or worship Donald Trump. But those extremes are out of the ordinary. Many are just people who passionately believe in a thing that isn’t real because it tells them what they want to hear.\s\sThis is ultimately what brings people to Q and what keeps them there. The promise of bad people being punished is one element of it but the feeling of being part of something important and powerful is vastly underestimated. Q believers see themselves as soldiers fighting for the ultimate cause—and are surrounded by people who validate them rather than insult or belittle them or try to fact-check them out of what they think is real. Yes Q will sometimes admit to making errors in drops. And Q posts their drops on 8chan a place full of racists and anti-Semites saying racist and anti-Semitic things.\s\sBut that can be explained away or written off as just another attack by the enemy.\s\sWhat’s real what’s tangible to Q believers is how it makes them feel. What questions it answers. What holes it fills that other aspects of their life don’t. For many believers who truly see themselves as non-violent patriots it’s that simple —good feelings shared with a community about something awesome that will happen to people who are keeping them down.\s\sBut for a few it metastasizes. Sometimes it’s due to mental illness. Other times it’s need and anger curdling into violent resentment. No matter the cause the end is the same: from the Capitol attack to countless tiny familial tragedies the results are violence pain and shattered lives. And onlookers struggling to understand what about this was so alluring in the first place.\sAdapted from The Storm is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement Cult and Conspiracy Theory of Everything. © Copyright 2021Rothschild? So you're going to post something from the pedo cabal?\s\s/sThese are the same people who had conspiracies on their minds 24/7 in private for years or appeared in public with strange signs on the street on vehicles etc. and will follow anything that feeds their mental illness. Proof can't exist to them.My dad still pretends he enlightened despite wrongly predicting the end of America like two dozen times over my lifetime.  Basic logic escapes them they can conveniently forget all the disproven crap that happens repeatedly.I think it this point they don't want to be wrong. Put too much effort into it alienated friends and family. They want to say 'see I was right all along'.\s\sOr they are just batshit crazy insane.Jesus told his followers that the Romans were going to be destroyed any day now.  They watched him get crucified.  \sPaul told his followers that Jesus was coming back any day now--don't even bother getting married unless you have to!  Thousands of years later he's the founder of the world's largest religion.  \sWilliam Miller gave specific dates for the return of Jesus.  Seventh-day Adventists and other Millerite sects are still around.  \sJoseph Smith was a demonstrable fraud and conman with multiple failed prophecies who claimed the imminent return of Jesus was at hand.  Nearly two hundred years later there are a few million Mormons around the world.\s\sWhen you're dealing with people whose beliefs are fundamentally irrational you can't use logic to sway them out of it.  The fact that Q has never been right about anything doesn't matter to these people.  Q doesn't appeal to people's brains it appeals to their emotions.  As long as the enablrers keep feeding them outrage--that their lives are controlled by dark outside forces conspiring to keep them down but they can fight back by Trusting The Plan--they aren't going anywhere.  We are witnessing the birth of a secular religion.Looking back on my former faith in hindsight and now with a better understanding of my own sexuality I can't help but wonder if Paul was just asexual and sex-repulsed or possibly unknowingly and self-hatingly gay and that those might have influenced his apparent disdain for marriage and relationships with women and thus his writings on how Christians should behave with regards to such. On top of his far more obvious misogyny of course.Not true about Jesus. He didn't give a fuck about the Romans actually. Everything else is spot on.I think this article does a good job on it: https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/q-trust-and-you?r=1082k&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=copy\s\sThese people have a narrow circle of trust and everyone in it still ends up supporting Q lunacy.  So they see something happen look into the circle and the circle tells them ""the Q way is still the way"" and the nod along.Hopium springs eternal?\s\sEdit- read the full article and enjoyed it thanks for posting.Because people are desperate for some reason..it's fascists all the way downPipeline?

US fascists are more organized than Qanon and are instrumentalizing their infiltration in positions of power.[deleted]>>  the phony narrative that there was an insurrection.\s\s""Look did we group en masse and tell anyone not ready to fight to stay back? Sure I guess. Did we rally around people telling us that our nation was under attack by Chinese-controlled agents of evil? Yeah I guess so. And Don Jr. DID tell us repeatedly before the rally that we have to ""fight"" in his live stream. And maybe Trump DID tell us to march to the Capitol to take it back. I guess that part is true. And yes there were gallows erected with people chanting 'Hang Pence.' I SUPPOSE the optics were bad on that a little. And yes we overran barricades took the ground by force while beating law enforcement officers. And okay after breaching the secured building we DID maybe a little continue to chase threaten and assault anyone inside including the slow work of breaking through bulletproof windows en route to the legislative chambers. Yes an armed QRF was posted just outside the DC gun-free zone. And I suppose it MAY be true that some of us went into the chambers with zip ties. And yes pipe bombs were found later. And we had t-shirts printed and called it a revolution.\s\s""I mean I guess I could see how it might look bad. But how could anyone look at just a little forceful occupation of a nation's capitol under threats of violence and see the beating to death of ONLY one or two Officers and think it was a 'seditious insurrection'? It wasn't that at all. And you'd see it wasn't that at all if you'd just dO YeR oWN REsEarCh.""\s\s/s obviously.Let's hope they are met by armed National GuardI sure hope so. I hope that Biden realizes that he can’t just play nice with these people and I hope to god he doesn’t let them walk all over him. I know I voted for the guy but I still have my concerns about him and the other Democrats wanting to cater to these assholes.The only reason they got as far as they did on Jan 6 was because the capitol was intentionally left undefended. Hopefully they get treated like BLM did.As well as the FBI CIA and Homeland Security (Hell even MI6 if you can)I'm glad the Capitol police are on the ball with this but I can't see this rally being a big thing. Jan 6 insurrectionists showed up because Trump was there and that was going to be the day they did *something* to overturn the election.\s\sWithout him and without that driving force I find it doubtful that we'll see anything upwards of 500 protestors if that. Still I hope MPD and Capitol Police show they are in no mood to fuck around and show up in force.I doubt these fools will be able to organize in large numbers ever again. They'll be lucky if they manage to repeat something like the 'million' MAGA marchLaws of diminishing returns does suggest that this will be a much smaller terrorist force.something tells me the capitol police are gonna be upset with these guys about their dead friends.They aren't going to do shit.  Only reason they showed up the first time is they thought Trump had their back (as if he gives a shit about anyone but himself).“Rioters” lol… not insurrectionists or seditionists lmao.Heres a link to read it without creating an account.https://archive.vn/MgodjSomething tells me the capitol police won’t be fucking around this time (I’m not saying they were before but you know what I mean)Well they will certainly be able to give them plenty of support when they are sharing a cellIf they are prepared for it this could be a good thing.\s\sShootarrestrepeatSo nice to see MAGATs supporting BLM and Antifa:)[deleted]If only this were the case!Love how she wears her mask as a chin warmer. /sChin diaper\*God knows she shouldn't be on any kind of education committee.I would not give an ultimatum.

Now Flynn. They've both been compromised by the deep state and their calls to arms are obviously CIA/FBI/NSA honeypot ops obviously. But Q is just too darn smart for that right? Right??[deleted]I don't get it most Q's are true American patriots who hate communism China and foreign power intervention yet they want their to military to act like it's being paid by the Chinese Communist party to put Trump into power again.Hear me out is Flynn a lizard person sent to destabilize the USA to make conquering world easier for lizard people? LmaoNah thats wacky. Hes an incredibly lazy viltrumite.This is not a joke.So disturbingIm pretty sure the constitution doesn't protect you from saying an armed insurrection should've happened. That's treason. And funny he thinks one of the poorest militarys actions would somehow be enacted by the most warhardend  proven military on Earth. This guy doesn't deserve the dirt to be dug from his graveFlynn is a treasonous prick and this isn’t the first time he’s advocated for a military takeover of the USA. \s\sTo support the geotus of course.They need to take this asshole's military pension. I'm a retired veteran. If I started giving fucking speeches calling for the violent overthrow of America you better believe they would yank my fucking benefits. Fuck this piece of shit. He is a fucking disgrace to anyone who has ever worn a military uniform. Unless it's Russian.I can't imagine why Obama fired him.What an absolute scum bagWhy has he not been arrested yet? Wouldn't this qualify as treason for calling for a civil war?Sedition probably.It's a HUGE mistake to not arrest and prosecute these people.  It will come back to bite us just as tolerating Fox and it's lies has.\s\sLock them up.Yes. I'm tired of these asshats saying and doing whatever the FUCK they want with ZERO accountability. It's not going to end well for us as a country until people are arrested and they experience consequences for this shit.I've been thinking the big thing to watch will be rightwing activism leading up to the midterms. If you remember the 2018 midterms there was a lot of grassroots organizing on the right for the Tea Party movement which involved a lot of rallies and protests. As we approach the 2022 midterms if the Trump-wing of the party begins to start putting pressure on the GOP to back their Q-brained candidates by demonstrating in public gatherings I worry we'll see a significant counter-protest movement that will lead to violent clashes and partisanship accelerating from are already divided current state.His brother is still a 3 star general in the US MilitaryI tried finding their social media/hashtags because I wanted to see if I know anyone who went but nothing. I mean okay they do have a few hashtags and a crappy website but no SM. Where all the tech/SM savvy Q people?? It drives me crazy. Where was the marketing? Are you not requesting people to post online? Do you not even have a dedicated hashtag for this 3 day event?? Ugh I wanna tear my hair out. Do better!!>	Where all the tech/SM savvy Q people?? \s\sThey all got banned from major social media sites.\s\sQ discussions mostly occur on Parler Gab and Telegram now.Social media doesn't allow for their tags to be searched.If you want to see footage Andrew Callaghan went and will probably upload a video in a few weeks. His YT channel is under Channel 5.I use r/ParlerWatch to keep up with some of their antics.Twitter bans the Qanon hashtags. You have to look for their stupid workarounds.Be Best perhaps?!?I mean even WEDDINGS have dedicated hashtags but this event can’t???? Ridiculous>Where all the tech/SM savvy Q people??\s\sHave you met these people?I wonder if Flynn or rather the shitheads he's stoking know what is happening in Myanmar really. I know many of them bought into the lie the government used to dismiss the November election - voter fraud - and arrest Aung San Syu Kii and her party. So okay they probably thought they stopped a coup or something who knows.\s\sBut what the government actually did are still exactly what Q people are cheering. An unpopular government arresting their opposition and killing their own people including children just to stay in power. They don't want democracy because the ""wrong"" people get into power. They want to stay in power and will happily kill their neighbors to get it.I think the worst part is they *like* the idea that their side can execute their opponents and opponent side supporters.These guys know that the walls are closing in on them and they are running out of escape routes. Their king lost the election their last-ditch insurrection attempt at the capitol failed and their attempts to overturn the vote have failed. They know that only a military coup can save them from the consequences of their crimes now. It's not going to happen but they are desperate.Unfortunately an aggressive wounded animal backed into a corner is also at its most dangerous. These assholes have nothing to lose.18 U.S. Code § 2385 - Advocating overthrow of Government\s \s\sWhoever knowingly or willfully advocates abets advises or teaches the duty necessity desirability or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States or the government of any State Territory District or Possession thereof or the government of any political subdivision therein by force or violence or by the assassination of any officer of any such government; or\s\sWhoever with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government prints publishes edits issues circulates sells distributes or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating advising or teaching the duty necessity desirability or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence or attempts to do so; or\s\sWhoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society group or assembly of persons who teach advocate or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence; or becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society group or assembly of persons knowing the purposes thereof—\s\sShall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years or both and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof for the five years next following his conviction.\s\sIf two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named in this section each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years or both and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof for the five years next following his conviction.\s\sAs used in this section the terms “organizes” and “organize” with respect to any society group or assembly of persons include the recruiting of new members the forming of new units and the regrouping or expansion of existing clubs classes and other units of such society group or assembly of persons.This man needs to recalled to active duty and immediately court martialedWhat the fuck is he doing at a QAnon conference?.

0,AmericanPolitics,VaushV,18,"I'm shocked shocked I tell you that conservatives want to keep people uneducated! Who could have possibly seen this coming?This is why I get annoyed when people on the left diminish the relevance of culture wars. Culture wars need to be won not ignored. And that's not me saying ""Abandon policy"". There needs to be a balance. When the right dominates the culture wars this is the result.It’s very frustrating when people say that the left needs to abandon the culture war because to me it shows that they’re not paying attention. The right barely makes economic arguments anymore when I first got into politics about ten years ago the arguments were all about economics. Granted most of those arguments were dumb and wrong but it wasn’t the endless deluge of culture war bullshit that we have today. The right can’t win the economic argument because we have the receipts but they know that our changing culture is going to freak out bigots and old people and that it’s a lot easier to muddy the waters around concepts that a lot of people have little understanding of. \s\sThe reason why the left can’t afford to give up on the culture war is because we see what happens when narratives aren’t effectively argued against. And this brings me to a problem that I have with a lot of leftists: I think that a lot of leftists don’t understand how common casual bigotry is in America even ones that are from America. It feels like a lot of leftists are only ever around other leftists and never hear some of the horrible things that even a lot of centrists say and by that I mean actual centrists. Leftists scratch their heads at why anyone would listen to Joe Rogan or Tim Pool but the fact is that most people in this country aren’t dedicated leftists who know that what most of these assholes say is wrong and can easily be swayed by their reactionary bullshit. I hear someone say something horrible about some minority group very often it happens so regularly that I just tune it out sometimes. And then you have leftists from other countries who think they know America better than we do and don’t understand that our government has been under assault by Christian fascists for the last 50+ years and that sometimes you need to vote Democrat to stop things like Republicans getting a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court so that this country doesn’t turn into fucking Saudi Arabia. I got a little ranty there sorry I guess I was bottling some stuff up.What do you think the next 5 years will hold for American politics? I’m honestly fuckin worried about a fascist takeover and I only ask because I can’t find an article about that topic online.This what happens when you let conservatives gain power. Hope this a wake up call to some 😤I really wish these articles would be written by mainstream journalists instead of the author of ' ""Troll Nation: How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Rat-F*cking Liberals America and Truth Itself.""' \s   \sIt'd be like InfoWars releasing an article saying the right were always right about CRT.Yeah that's the issue can't openly say tens of millions of Americans are horrible people that should not be worked with and their opinions not considered moving forwardthey always wereWooaaaaahhhh. Nooooo waayyyyNo fucking shit. Thank you Salon your contribution is timely as always.Yet the enlightened centrists like Sam Harris still keep insisting that Twitter is far leftevery enlightened centrist type I've met online have been so smug and insufferableTrue most Twitter users are far-right and the only things that get traction are right-wing talking points.  \s \sIf you're left-wing on Twitter especially if you're open about it you get trashed on by the majority of the users.Did you read the article?Didn’t Twitter work on an anti-Nazi bot and then didn’t deploy it when it started to identify Republicans as Nazis?There was also a bot that got turned into a nazi by listening to random postsThat sounds familiar but my memory is failing me at the momentNuh uh they all get censored! 😭Yes.If you looked up the keyword ""Baldwin"" or ""Alec Baldwin"" pretty much all the top tweets were from white nationalist trolls Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec who made like 40 tweets each about it but sure they're being ""censored""lolDamn. Though it may instead be the tape of him being shitted on by a russian hooker.Oh boy. I love the rainNo negotiations with terrorists. Arrest the President now.Dude is still making threats.Straight up terroristic threats.Sort of.

The geopolitics of this isn't as simple as the images you are seeing on the screen today.  All our presence did was train an Afghan army unenthusiastic about defending their country for a cause like women's rights and keep the Taliban occupied from coordinating massive terrorist acts on Beijing and Moscow.\s\sXi Putin you're on the clock to act upon a problem in your region you've luckily ignored for 20 years because the U.S. military has given you cover.  Instead of oppressing Muslim minorities in your own local spheres of influence you should have been assisting in the training and financing of the Afghan military.  \s\sYour move.Wasn't the original reason we got involved is because we didn't want the Soviet Union influencing Afghanistan?China is going to be busy taking full control of Taiwan first.

Share it with everyoneLmao they called that ""'Historic' peace agreement""? I dont think those terrorist know whats historic or peace at all.Down the memory hole….I was so glad and surprised when Trump announced it. And I fully support Biden for withdrawing from Afghanistan. Bombing people doesn't change their ideologies it only hardens them.Now that the GOP already has what it needs to shame the Democratic Party into oblivion the details do not matter. Fell right into their trap.The geopolitics of this will prove the GOP to be painfully reactionary in their finger pointing. \s\sThe autopsy on Afghanistan was started the day we directed our resources at Iraq rather than Afghanistan Saudi Arabia and the Taliban.  We could have trained Afghans for forty years and the Taliban would still have taken over the country in no time.\s\sAfghanistan is a creation of the British and the local tribal elite of the country under colonialism.  The disdain for the Afghan upper classes by the lower classes within those borders imagined up by the British has been exploited by extremist Islamic clerics for 100 years.  This wasn't something that just happened with the USSR's failure there or the US's attempt at training an army who didn't see women's rights as a patriotic cause to defend the construct the British gave their elite.\s\sThe Afghan region is first and foremost tribal secondly religious.  We refused to accept what the British and Russians learned before us.  The next phase will be a civil war within the ranks of the Taliban that balkanizes the old map and it will be one  Moscow and Beijing cannot ignore.\s\sGOP ""I told you so"" thinking is short sighted and ignores history.Pretty much. GOP winning the spin game while the Dems flounder about. Good lord this party cannot get a message across worth a poo.Aged like milkI like aged milk or requesón.Yea that's a hard no. In the spirit of healing every Republican should be actively supporting impeachment.Yes they should!!!It’s up to Congress. I’m all up for this to be done super thoroughly. And why not wait until Democrats have full control?Because he’s in there right now with too much power to be trusted.Every Republican should be vowing to support impeachment & the expulsion of the Republicans in the Sedition caucus - in the spirit of healing.Most Definitely!!!Not only no but fuck no.I second this emotion!!!impeach now consistency in setting the precedent.  If he leaves office before then regardless of impeachment or not AG needs to bring charges against trump. conspiracy for one.Absolutely!!!>The American right has been drunk on its freedom from two kinds of   \sinhibition since Donald Trump appeared to guide them into the promised   \sland of their unleashed ids. One is the inhibition from lies the other   \sfrom violence. Both are ways members of civil society normally limit   \stheir own actions out of respect for the rights of others and the   \scollective good. Those already strained limits have snapped for leading   \sRepublican figures from Tucker Carlson on Fox News to Ted Cruz in the   \sSenate and for their followers.\s\sJust the opening paragraph should motivate EVERY progressive and independent to turn out and vote in EVERY election from now till EVERY last Republican't in EVERY publicly held office is voted out!As long as the rest of us do more than point and laugh on election day...Center Independent Greens Liberals Democrats all have to put some skin in the game and limit the party that clearly does not care about the fundamental principles of democracy out of elected office in Washington and state legislatures.And they will be successful.... UNLESS the Democratic legislatures pass a voting rights act.Just so we're all clear though fascism has taken over the Republican party.  This the wet dream of the Koch brothers who have been working on this since the 1950's.Did anyone expect him to veto it?Pretty typical of them. The hypocrisy really shows when they fail to condemn this sort of shit.Can’t wait until this fucking clown is history.  I’ve never hated a human being as much as I hate this piece of shit.   Just scum to his very core I was giving him as a 5 year old. He is so full of himself and thinks he is so smart he can just lie and lie and lie and nobody will figure it out. Just like the hundreds of millions of dollars he let so many Russians launder into his casinos apartment buildings and business building. They will never figure that out. Its Jared's Don Jr and my secret. Just like the meeting with the Russians. Trump represents the fusion of one of history's biggest egos with the self-control of an over-tired toddler. It's not that he ***can't*** understand it's that he ***won't admit*** to understanding. Also he may have an academic curiosity just how gullible Republicans have become.Time for the showdown. I thought it wouldn’t be until August. \s\sBut it looks like Donnie Jr Roger Stone and Michael Cohen are getting indicted.  \s\sTrump is trying to force the issue now. \s\sThe Republican Party is Illegitimate.\s\sKind of Ironic.\sI’m sooo tired of worrying about being “watched or surveilled” when I leave my house . Or use my cell or internet. Even my smart tv has the capability to spy back into my living room ….I tell people watch what you text … I know I doThe US isn't the only place with a ""Patriot act""\s\sNew Zealand has their own equivalent. It doesn't s how they worked with the US to take down Kim Dotcom\s\sMy point being that it is too great a power for any government left or right wing to give up. I think you will find all the major governments will have or eventually have some rules that allows them to spy on their people either directly or indirectly.How do you feel about what's going on in [Australia](https://www.techspot.com/news/91071-australia-passes-surveillance-bill-police-take-over-accounts.html) and how long till our politicians follow suit?They obviously aren't doing a good enough job if an insurrection can take place in this country. Also why is trump still free?Not going to happen under either party. After the $600 bank account surveillance flopped they came back with $10000 per year in transactions that's an average of $208 per week in transactions and the IRS can gain warrantless access to your banking records. It's not about going after the rich. It's about going after the baby sitter the lawnmower man the kitchen tattoo artist. It's about going after every single one of us that might have some kind if low income side gig. \s\sNo the surveillance state isn't going away until we defund politics.NSA been doing all this well  before the Patriot Act....with the rise and empowerment of rightwing militias and the threat of that I don;t want to have LESS surveillance....Literally played like fiddleIt already expired.I cannot wait until the GOP is stripped of their representation in this government.  They prove over and over again that they hate american democracy and terrorize everybody leftward of them.  They are all far right extremists and terrorist insurgents.Donald Trump could shoot someone on 5th avenue and it wouldn't matter.  This leak won't mean a thing.  It's just further verification for those of us who are not crazy that Trump is crazy.  It won't matter one iota to Trump's supporters.It won’t matter one iota to those who unwittingly support Putin.   FTFY.We have known this the whole time. The 1st reporting i remember about the Kremlin link was in the summer of 2016. A ton of traffic was detected from an ISP address in Trump tower. The address only received traffic from one place in Russia and it was a lot of traffic. The article concluded it was a 2 way communication between Trump campaign and some authority in Russia. \s\sEverything that has happened since backs up this initial theory. The president of the US was a Russian asset weather he understood that it not.I'm not sure about some of the stuff people are saying about the Russia link but yeah they definitely wanted him in there wether he was in direct communication with them or not and even if he didn't realize that I don't think he would care either way.I wish any of this mattered to them. It don't.This is the smoking gun at long last held in the hand of Vladimir Putin.\s\sI would still like to see some work done on authenticating this or otherwise corroborating it.\s\sThis confirms what I already thought to be true to an astonishing level really so I'm a little suspicious of it.So if it's true now then why is Trump not in handcuffs and in prison for fraud and treason?So basically all Trump supporters helped Putin hurt America.  Yeah I’d say that makes them tools and very much traitors.Whoa. Is anyone else reporting on this?Just like we all knew.Even Thomas got this one right though for weird reasons. Still that's something.This is really great news.

No more stalling.Awwwww….what a shame.""Emergency motion""\s\sSo it's really bad.I notice you’re all obsessed with Trump.Can someone explain what this actually means. What is going to happen now.The dumbasses do realize that by removing him from office he may also be arrested and no longer a threat right?I doubt it’s fear of him retaliating. The fear most likely of them ending their careers because trumps cult will completely turn on them.Have you seen Trump's personality cult? It's scary. \s\sWe lost a local newspaper today. It's shutting down after being in print for almost 200 years. And of course when they announced it the responses were all Trump goons shouting ""Yay! Hurr fake news xD Far leftist propaganda! Fox News is the only reliable news source xD""\s\sI mean honestly have you even ventured into the cesspool of TD since Romney made his stand? Or did you see it when McCain died? People cheering McCain's death since he had the audacity to stand up to Dear Leader. People wishing death upon Romney and discussing ways to end his career.\s\sIt's lunacy. It's far beyond what we are supposed to be as the United States of America.Even if just removed from office what is he gonna do?  He’s already impeached so can’t run for President again...right?Trump is (very) popular with republicans voting against him will probably cause you to lose your next election. Simple as that.\s\sAnd the GOP would crack down on them too because they want party unity.I think they fear his cult not him. Not one of them is actually afraid of Trump. His cult has sent bombs to democrats justified and been pardoned for warcrimes emboldened the Klan and other hatemongers said rape is okay even if Trump wanted to rape their own - Remember the psycho Youtube bitch. That's all of them she represents them and what they think.They didn't say there were afraid of Trump...Well the thing is if he's arrested his followers won't be. These Republicans don't fear losing their jobs they fear their lives. Mitt Romney needs extra security like now.Their moron constitutions would not get them re-elected thenExactly it's like a cop not arresting you for robbery because he's afraid you'll leave a negative review of the police department. \s\s'A banana in the tailpipe!'That would leave Mr. Trumps supporters to lay waste in November to those that removed him from office.That's not the point. \s\sThey are afraid of a number of things \s\s1) they vote to remove him but don't get 2/3rds majority and are in his forever shit list. \s\s2) that after the vote they would lose the support of the gop base. Make no mistake. He is still very popular in the gop and with the republican base. \s\sUltimately 3) they are worried about losing reelection due to the blow back.Lindsey graham in particular is probably in bed with trump on something massively dirty and illegal. Idk how else to rationalize his flip flopProblem is as soon as he'd get arrested which he probably wouldn't he'd get pardoned. Even if the next president for some reason weren't pence whoever it is would need to pardon him. Trump having been the president means he knows a lot of presidential secrets and for someone as spiteful as him and someone who doesn't know how to shut the hell up as badly as him it would be dangerous for the federal government to leave him in a prisonTypical of tyrannical regimes. Hitler's sycophantic hangers-on were afraid to wake him up to let him know the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy. Same for Stalin when the Nazis had crossed their Western border on the road to Moscow.\s\sThe end is near.Near? I wish I had your confidence.For Trump or for the republic?Simply put:\s\sI hope it haunts them for the rest of their lives if he starts doing things that can no longer be excused. Things that actually keep them up at night. Arguably he already is but it hasn't been enough to bother them (yet.)\s\sPeople dying. Different parts of the government collapsing. The United States itself falling into disrepair. That's all on them.\s\sThey knew exactly what sort of shit Trump would immediately do if they let him off the hook for this so EVERY BIT OF SUFFERING that comes after is THEIR fault.I'm moving to Canada fuck it.......But they got paid so that other stuff doesn’t matterSo the Republican strategy is that they think it looks better to be in fear of the president than to be a sycophantic bootlicker. Well I have news for them whether they're one or the other both look pretty effing bad.Craven cowards. Disgusting.[deleted]They don't fear *Trump*.  They fear his cult of personality which has *long* since completely absorbed the GOP's base.  If said cult stays home on election day or finds new more Trump-ian candidates to primary them the existing GOP politicians in office *will* lose their seats (and with them their power).\s\sIf the GOP is going to get rid of Donnie they're going to do so in a way that allows them to completely deflect blame away from themselves so that their voters will still think of them as having been loyal to Trump.  Like for instance assassinating him and framing the Democrats or Iran for it.Many of these cult members brought the Tea Party to the Senate and House...the beginning of this crap. Not to mention Sarah Palin craziness that pulled the hoods off the nutjobs aka Tea PartiersThey fear us more.  The thought of principled democrats retaking office fills them with dread.  The question people should ask is what are they so afraid of once they lose power?Trump has probably spent his morning planning on revenge on Romney.I had a customer this morning bragging that Trump is now gonna make Utah into a giant open strip mine because of Romney's vote.Fear *and* greed. Not necessarily in that order.Makes what Romney did all the more impressive.Why? He won his last election by 43 points.  And he's watching in real time as Mormons lower their approval of Trump. He is in no political danger  and he's already survived the full force of both the Republican and Democrat smear machines.That's why republicns do everything: they are afraid of everything all the timeThey all have partaken of russian moneyTrump is a little bitch and every single one of those GOP members are cowards/ traitors to our nation.\s\sTrump supporters at this point are their own cult. I showed my mother in law all the evidence of what Trump did and all she said was “Well that’s NBC/ NyTimes/ Reuter’s (yup even Reuter’s) so it’s a bad source! It’s the Democrats!” My wife asked her mom what her sources were and all she said was Fox News. It’s like no matter how much evidence you show them they will never condemn him. It’s sickening.I look forward to seeing the reactions when he turns on his party.The thing is there are Republicans right now taking notes  learning what Trump did 'right' and what his missteps were.  And in 4 or 8 or 12 years they'll have crafted a candidate that will knowing the Right shit all over Trump's legacy and be more extreme.It's not just Trump. The the party has already had several senators unseated for opposing Trump. And Trump's attacking Romney. it may be time for our first Mormon president.\s\sI'm not Mormon. I'm agnostic - religeosly and politically. But Romney's record in the Senate is better than most.Marco Rubio literally said Trumps actions meet the bar for impeachment and then says he he won’t impeach because this is partisan. Not voting what you believe is what is making it partisan.Spineless cowards who piss on the constitution because they are afraid of his voters.Republicans have no spine and are cowards.Except Mitt Romney his interview was amazing.The word to describe that is coward.Cowards and CrooksNo they didn’t they did it for the money. If they would have impeached him he would have been removed from office  then the fbi state dept and CIA would have resumed all pending investigations and put his ass in jail or have him die in an accident.Of what? His tiny baby hands?I understand democrats are angry but this article is just pretending to know people's inner thoughts.bunch of cowardsChicken sh*ts. All of ‘Em.Yellow-belly cowards...Their districts are so gerrymandered Trump can hold them prisoner. But only if they are cowards.Fear of what tho?! You cowards WERE the check and balance. You stepped aside and now we all are afraid since he has no check. \s\sYou could have done what’s right and the risk to you already rich people was losing re-election. You woulda been fine monetarily too.Cowards! We're led by cowards.Shit ton of money helps with that.Cowards isn’t the GOP the party of tough guys or so they tell everyoneFucking cowards.Most of dictatorship have started with the abdication of Legislative chambers.The senate vote should have been anonymous.\s\s\sNo retaliation danger.I’ve never seen stress poor diet and lack of sleep take so long to finish someone especially one as deserving as Mad King Donald.What if Trump actually literally goes mad?  He seems sometimes to be on the verge.  And now he's enraged after the impeachment and the Rush Limbaugh scandal etc.They’ll be too afraid to do anything when Trump decides he’s going to make himself president for life. Seriously people we better have a plan for when this guy decides he’s not going to give up power.And?Just like an abused partner.I don't think it is Trump per se.  Though he is a complete asshole really he himself is limited.  Rather if you oppose Trump you oppose his vocal and let's face it fucking looney bin supporters.  Your office will be deluged with hate mail all sorts of threats made family members intimidated and probably a few real and legit threats will come to fruition.  Also the big money supporters will walk away.  For Romney he doesn't care.  For some farmboy like Cory Gardner?  Not only will you loose reelection but you will not get a job afterwards.  So these Senators are looking at loosing their current gig and then no opportunities later.Well no shit! If he goes down they all go down. If he gets imprisoned they all get imprisoned. Mob RulesFear of what!!?? He only has the power they give him! If they showed him they were in charge they could make him their pussy instead of the other way around!The GOP are a bunch of little wimps except Romney.\s\sRomney is an extremely respectable Republican.Even Lamar Alexander who is retiring caved. What is he afraid of?Fear of what Russians meddling in the elections and ruining the country?They're not afraid of Trump. They're afraid of Putin the puppeteer.LolThe fear that stokes so many people is death more than losing one's job and that's why so many of these warhawks in the Republican party like Trump and Cheney had multiple defermentsand now would gladly send other people's children to die. That's just plain cowardly but now they're even below the standard of cowardice. They fear the idea of losing their jobs over the loss of a fragile democracy. It should validate to anyone with half a brain that their true core worship is money and nothing else. Money over morals ethics integrity and love of country. The Democrats should remind people every day of what these people stand for; make their worst fear a reality in November.I’m tired of hearing all this “behind closed doors repubs know drumpt is wrong” ...repubs don’t care let’s stop making excuses for their coward behavior!That's because they are gutless. I repeat gutless.  Let me say that one more time GUTLESS.  Moral decadence has never made a quantum leap downward quite like this one.They’re afraid of the wrong thing.You know guys this is an objective assessment - don’t get angry - please: \s\sthe House rushed impeachment. They needed to build up the evidence for PR purposes. If you compare how Nixon was removed with how this House moved forward... it’s like night and day... in 1974 the House voted 410-4 to begin an impeachment inquiry. That’s not a typo: 410-4!!!!    \s\sUS District Court and the Court of Appeals and then the US Supreme Court ordered Nixon to produce the tapes... several of Nixon’s aides were tried and found guilty... his AG and deputy AG resigned... Republican Senators went to the White House and told him to quit... I mean the sky was falling... \s\sThat’s what it takes to remove a President and I think we rushed it in case. I just hope it does not backfire.Nixon wasn’t removed.Fake newsSo proud that Sherrod Brown is my senator.[removed]It looks like you’ll be on the wrong side of history then.Honestly rabbithole is right on point. This is nothing real different from the primaries or the general party stance. AND this is exactly why he will lose the election. He is publicly stating he is against the majority of the countries working class and lower classes. To Romney this is just a game a challenge to try and win. His career doesn't hinge on this he isn't in it to help the people. Obama has said even before he was a senator what his ultimate goals for being in politics are and that is to help as many people he can. These next four years the country is going to see growth as the plans start to take effect much like Clintons second term.I agree with everything until the end. Saying we are definitely gonna start recovering this next term is way too early to call especially considering the plans to get us there have mostly been shot down by a republican congress. Clinton had it easier. Anyways I hope you're right but I think you're being way too optimistic. What I feel we can say with relative certainty is that it's definitely not going to get worse. A lot of our recovery hinges on taking back the house. We take back the house recovery will be a lot swifter if we don't I don't see why it will be any different than the last 2 years.Stupid hippies and their anti-evil bias.  They need to stop shooting up marijuanas and having poo-sex and learn to bow down before Satan like decent responsible citizens.What is most hypocritical about this is that the people he is referring to are ALSO 'paying all of the taxes they are legally required to' just like Mitt made a virtue of in his own case. Is there anything here that surprises or shocks anyone? He said all of this during the primaries. Maybe tone down the title a bit.Calling people who don't earn enough to pay *income tax* freeloaders goes a bit further than that. And stating that he has to be careful in what he says in order to fool the independents into voting for him is also a bit past his primary stance.Honestly I prefer him in this video bit at least he's being sincere even his candor is 'better'. I agree with rabbithole spot on. Very disappointing - but not unexpected at this point.  How far they have fallen.Just following in Reagan's footsteps!I hate KansasIm honestly happy to see this. The people desearve the honest family value oriented government they keep electing. Keep at it. Im just sad for those that are stuck in that hell hole who will suffer. Trickle-up economics.

I guess it goes right along with their “Christian values.”You just nailed it the GOP has abandoned its entire platform if they ever actually believed in it at allFascists and authoritarians are famous for their law and order I supposeGiven that the Emperor of the Roman Empire was also the head of the Christian Church in the west for several centuries and in the Eastern/Byzantine Empire for a millennium (to the point that the Bishops of the Orthodox Church wondered how Christianity could survive without an Emperor when Constantinople fell). . .the history of Caesaropapism certainly means that there is a certain strain of Christianity where ""We **must** be lead by an Emperor!"" *is* a Christian Value.\s\s There are Christians who think otherwise and Christianity spent centuries not being ruled by an Emperor before it became the State Church of Rome. . .but there is an argument that can be made for ""We must be ruled by a monarch"" is a Christian Value for some people.That and greed. Those whose primary value is the acquisition of wealth or more than happy to support Trump's bullshit.Let's not forget ""personal responsibility"". You know like wearing a mask or getting vaccinated for the greater good. Or not giving your kid a handgun.Trump: “ I lost because of election fraud?”Oh man quit your BS. 40 something courts rejected that crap even republican appointment judges thew those cases out of their courts. Hell the committee needs to finish it job and there no executive privilege for trying to overthrow the U.S government. These aholes should be taken outback and shot for treason. \s\sFace it you were suckered into believing Trump's BS. Now that the appeals court has ruled that all records from the Nat'l archives  regarding the 01/06/21 insurrection  Trump is escalating to the SCOTUS. Same old Trump BS stall stall stall. If your or I were to manipulate property taxes the way the Trump organization did to avoid taxes or do the same to get more in loans we'd be in jail already. \s\sNow go get vaccinated.And they’re not being arrested for conspiracy why?Because Federal investigations of conspiracies don't work the way you see it on investigation procedural TV series.

All democrats left right and center need to stop pretending republicans are operating in good faith.That's sedition that's a federal crime.

Last time I checked neither of them support dictatorial power grabs instituting elements of fascism in the United States or threatening/alluding/fantasizing to kill members of Congress.

They are also anti science.

Only 5 people ever caught it......The vaccine was already being distributed.

Everyone continuing that lie is guilty for anything that happens.Reminder vote up to make this seen more.. of course we don't support Trump sabatoging the post office to cheat on the election but not a reason to vote down which will  only hide thisI've gotten mail in ballots for years. I usually walk it into the polling place to drop in the box.OK if I post my take on the USPS sabotage that i've copy/pasted in a few posts? (pre Friday Night Massacre)\s\s----\s\sThis travesty is much much more than merely closing branches and slowing mail to disrupt the vote. \s\sHere are a few reasons trump* appointed the acting PG who is a major campaign donor with zero experience (acting because like many many other 'acting' cabinet and department head positions trump* knows Congress will never approve their appointment)...\s\s* They want to eliminate or disrupt absentee ballots because with more people able to easily vote it means trump* will lose by a landslide.\s\s* They want to reduce efficiency so they can privatize it because of a lack of efficiency through a no-bid contract to the highest reelection campaign donor 'bidder'/Mar-A-Lago member - which translates to kickbacks (campaign donations) which equals legal bribes!\s\s* They (trump*) wants to fuck with Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon the biggest client of USPS but more important Bezos owns the 'fake news' Washington Post who reports the truth about the presidential criminal enterprise for pulling stunts exactly like this one.\s\sAmazon is the biggest client of the USPS.  So big that the Post Office delivers their packages on Sunday - the only mail delivered on Sunday.  Amazon customers who are used to 2 day delivery may now have to wait up to a week or more and may decide to shop elsewhere.  Maybe some Amazon packages 'get lost in the system' and never delivered...\s\sBecause trump* hates Bezos so much he is willing to disrupt one of the oldest (1792/George Washington) and most efficient departments of the USA Government just to fuck with Jeff Bezos.  Let that sink in...\s\s* And maybe *the most important reason of all* - '**TO OWN THE LIBS**' ! ! ! ! !*\s\s----------\s\sThe new Postmaster General is Louis DeJoy.  Since January 2020 DeJoy has donated $360000 to President Trump’s re-election campaign and roughly $70000 to the Republican National Committee.  He was appointed in May 2020...  \s\s(if you do the math he donated over $86000 a month/over $2866 per day to buy this job that pays $291650 per year...)\s\sNow you know the price for trump* to sell the job to someone with absolutely no experience.  Let that sink in and realize that he sold every other high level position under similar circumstances - Mar-A-Lago members bribed trump* to get an 'acting' position with no experience...\s\sThey spend much much more to get the job than the job pays.  Think about that...\s\sWhere is the return on investment??\s\sDeJoy and his wife have over $70 million dollars in holdings in USPS competitors UPS and J.B. Hunt Trucking.  Shouldn't this be a conflict of interest?  If he makes the Post Office flounder in inefficiency don't you think people will migrate to UPS and his package delivery services??  \s\sOh his $70 Million dollar package delivery company received $700 million dollars in stimulus funds...\s\sOH WAIT he is the 'acting' PG so he is beyond scrutiny.  It also helps that Barr & the DOJ & the judges and Mitch & the Senate are in trump*s pocket so in effect there are no more checks and balances in American government anymore.\s\sWhat trump* is doing is incredibly heinous!  Yet he eliminated every option of watchdogs...\s\sFunny how that works out as well as all the oversight committees stripped bare and gagged.\s\sThis new crony sees no problem that all the mail does not get delivered every day (like forever up until now) and it is OK that a backlog is compounded every day week month year...\s\sAlready a daily priority ranking system has been assigned to determine the importance of each envelope or package and how timely it should be delivered if delivered at all.  Priority Mail is no longer a priority First Class is an old term for dependable mail...\s\sThe acting Postmaster General and trump* feel it is wasteful to pay overtime or hire new employees or keep all post offices open or budget for infrastructure improvements or tune up/update the trucks to ensure every day that:\s\s""*[Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds](https://www.federaljobs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bigstock-Mail-Man-During-Snow-Storm-In-58944299.jpg)*""\s\sThe new slogan should be.

It was a trump* demand to [put a stick in the spokes](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/016/674/802.jpg) to sabotage an efficient government agency for a reelection scheme and also to stroke his ego and fuck with his 'fake news' enemy.  \s\s* Oh and 'own the libs'....\s\sThis shit show has the trump* smell all over it he just needed a lackey to be manipulated like a marionette.

He's coming right out and telling everyone that's he's willing to do whatever to stay in the White House. Add to that Kanye's apparent stalking horse campaign & the news around that and it speaks volumes.

I don’t care how I just care he’s goneAre they positive he’s gone?I wonder what Devin Nunes' cow is going to do...Does he expect to get paid?He's trying to milk a new cash cow after his old cow made fun of him.You know damn well he won’t receive one red cent of money too lolHe will end up in jail.In thoughts and prayersSo... Devin Nunes is going to be the front-man/fall-guy for Truth (TM).  It's almost poetic.Can a Democrat replace him?This is the only thing that matters.What Democrats should do is start looking for centrists willing to run as Republicans and help them out. At least make it difficult to just re-install dumb/crazy people.[deleted]No its in a very trump dominated district.  Tulare County.Very very unlikely. Devin was in a safe red seat.Ole Nunes may have jumped the gun there since it’s being investigated by feds now.Nunes is probably more kompromised than Dana Rohrabacher. His move to Trump’s company is practically an admission that they’re both all in with the international mafia. The sketchy billion dollar investment just confirms it. The whole thing is a giant flashing neon sign for a national security risk.So…if trump somehow wins in 2024…will he be allowed to run his businesses including this new one…like he did the last time?Of course who’s going to stop him.  America!Does the Democratic Governor get to replace him until the next election?No that's only for the senate. Special election would be the only way to fill the seatA seat badly needed by Democrats. It would be glorious to see that seat flipped after he quit to take a job where he will be suing Trump in 9 months for not being paid.Not likely. Have you ever been to Visalia? It’s like a big chunk of Kentucky appeared in California one day.The next Con to be elected to that seat will likely be as big or bigger P.O.S.*Stares at Cow account* … any response?A good start.  Just need to get rid of all the other corrupt republicansThat was easyI hope this is true but the only thing I want to know is how the fuck did he get out of being indicted for all the bullshit he was involved in during the last four years with the despicable douchebag Donald? Before you said I know the AG was a dirty bastard but what about now they can definitely look back on what he did and possibly indict him but then again I'm not too fond of AG Garland either I think he's soft and he may even be a little scared to really do his job I think they need to get a new AG in there a seasoned AG that's not afraid to indict and convict.Great. Can all of Trump's bitches leave office so people with integrity and a spine can take their place? Obviously it's wishful thinking that we won't end up with someone worse but I can dream.Oh this is gonna be good.

Trump is a former occupant of the Oval Office and is likely to make another presidential bid in 2024. He had his hands on the national security apparatus once before and may well again. The identities of the investors who just tossed $1 billion his way are of interest because anyone able to buy their way into Trump’s good graces by plopping a bag of money on his desk could sway public policy — which makes Trump a national security threat.\s>\s>What might it mean for example if countries such as Saudi Arabia or others in the Middle East have decided to invest in his venture? That’s not an entirely hypothetical question.Perfect! Everything Trump touches turns to shit.King Donald is a comedy of errors. Evil intent with no fear.

Given her track record I'm more doubtful she means everything that she's been saying lately.Yeah with a lot of issues she hasn't said much and that makes this a little difficultThey probably are trying to assume that she isn't lying about her beliefs to the American people in her recent rhetoric.I'm a bot *bleep* *bloop*.

Just like when you tell your supporters they are victims it provides the justification for them to victimize others and discriminate.  The entire Republican platform is premised on this culture of false grievance and projection.  For example look at the conservative response to BLM.Their problem is well Republicans have lots of problems but the Problem they are trying to fix  Is That they are a **minority** That's why they keep trying to make it harder For everyone else to vote Because they are worried that people are going to start to treat them like they have been treating minorities all these years.Just like it also justifies the voter suppression tacticsWe saw the conservative response when January 6th happened with support from the GQP for it.\s\sI don't know a single democrat/left leaning person that hasn't condemned any and all violence in BLM protests.

That's very sad.  \s\s\sOnly our votes can exclude them from office please do not waste yours.The GOP has NEVER stood for equality.Whenever a republican blames Democrats of doing something I see that as projection and it is the Republicans who are really doing that.💯I have a personal example of this; my wealthy Texan MIL knew her two daughters weren’t republicans so she filled out their absentee ballots herself and threatened to cut off their college tuition if they said anything.Um...

Her argument was that the unpledged/super delegate system protects *grass-roots activists* from having to compete with well-known elected officials over pledged delegate slots. It's the exact opposite to what the headline is claiming. \s\s>DWS: ""We are as a Democratic Party really highlight and emphasize inclusiveness and diversity at our convention and so **we want to give every opportunity to grassroots activists** and diverse committed Democrats to be able **to participate attend and be a delegate at the convention**. And **so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn’t competition between them.**""\s\sHere she is on with Bret Baier on Fox answering the same question:\s\shttps://youtu.be/RFZtyOTAC6E?t=145\s\s>DWS: ""In a primary in a caucus the candidates come out of those with pledged delegates who are bound on the first ballot to support the candidate that earned that delegate. Unpledged delegates are our party leaders and elected officials who actually can make up their mind at any point and change their mind.\s>\s>**We separate those so that we don't have elected officials and party leaders running against the activists who we want to make sure are helping to diversify our convention.** That's something we take great pride in. A native american. A cancer survivor. **Those people should have an opportunity to be delegates too and they shouldn't have to deal with very well known elected officials and party leaders and that's why we separate them.**""\s\sIt may not be a particularly good argument for the system but that doesn't negate the fact that it's ridiculous for so many people to be outraged over something she never even said.I don't think I could possibly conceive of a worse answer to that question. I guess she gets points for honesty though? No in this case honesty fails.This is a Republican blog spinning her words and then quoting yet another Republican blog (Hot Air) further spinning them. DWS inartfully said the exact opposite to what the headline claims. \s\sShe's arguing that giving giving super-delegate status to elected well known party officials (for example Bernie Sanders is one) allows regular pledged delegate slots to be reserved for grass-roots members of the party to compete over. She's saying the grass-roots is being protected from having all those slots easily gobbled up by professional politicians with name recognition.\s\sIt may or may not be a reasonable explanation but it's clearly not anything like what these right-wing blogs are claiming she said. She was asked to explain a long standing arcane party primary mechanism that she had nothing to do with putting in place.Wow... Seriously? You're defending this? [deleted]Just read a plethora of your other posts. Good work you. Very good responses to many points. You've done a lot of homework. >“Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don’t have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists. We are as a Democratic Party really highlight and emphasize inclusiveness and diversity at our convention and so we want to give every opportunity to grassroots activists and diverse committed Democrats to be able to participate attend and be a delegate at the convention. And so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn’t competition between them.”\s\sDid she really say these things? maybe you should read the article and watch the videoHow many ways does this ignorant piece of shit think of to cut his fat orange nose off to spite his spray painted Halloween face?

Also the cut off to stop paying social security is something like 150000 which is ridiculous.I think it’s better to have a cap on paying in and paying out like they do now.  If they removed the cap either they have to pay high income people huge amounts of money when they retire or they only cap payouts which would be a huge money grab.\s\sHigher taxes on the elite is what made America the industrial giant it was they either invested their profits in jobs and industry or lost a big % of the profit to taxes.....\s\s&#x200B;\s\s[Historical Rates](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02inpetr.pdf)\s\s**39.6 percent:** Top tax rate in 2000\s\s**31 percent:** Top tax rate in 1991\s\s**50 percent:** Top tax rate in 1986\s\s**70 percent:** Top tax rate in 1980\s\s**91 percent**: Top tax rate in 1963\s\s**84.4 percent:** Top tax rate in 1950\s\s**94 percent:** Top tax rate in 1945\s\s**79 percent**: Top tax rate in 1939\s\s**63 percent:** Top tax rate in 1935\s\s**25 percent:** Top tax rate in 1931\s\s**46 percent:** Top tax rate in 1924\s\s**73 percent:** Top tax rate in 1921\s\s**7 percent:** Top tax rate in 1915The fact that this dope thinks anyone cares about his opinion is shameful. Not only do people care about his opinion (as well they should he is a candidate for president right now) but many agree with him.\s\sShocking to you I know.Clinton's comments are not shameful. What's shameful is O'Malley being on a high horse. He used 9/11 to talk about the Bush Tax cuts (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9117-2005Feb8.html) \sAt least Clinton's comments made sense and were honest. I can't say the same for O'Malley's arguably equally odious commentary. \s\s*That being said* I'm all for a dialogue of different opinions but I really dislike all this negativity in the comments. I think what people have a problem with is that she really dodged the question and changed the topic completely. Thank's for the down votes guys. Y'all are classy :)Great! All Trump did was lie all he does not is lie.  He needs to be held accountable for his corruption.It doesn't matter how blatant the lie his followers will never accept the truth even when it's right in front of them.I didn't realize anybody didn't know this...The answer to MAGA What Is Truth?  You can't handle the truth?  The truth is what they say it is you are all wrong...No surprise here.basically Donald J Trump is just lies.Remember Miles Taylor? He also said the same.

Good on him for finally realizing it and speaking outLong may his story be told.What he is advocating is literal treason against the United States.republican that is why.We have officially lost our democracy when things like this go completely unchecked. Free speech is one thing but this is open sedition and should be punished accordingly. Disgusting.They allow it means we got problems.*Advocating* sedition however is generally protected by the First Amendment. Nonetheless seeing as how this only recently happened and indictment by a grand jury is still required to check actual sedition except when caught in the act the fact he hasn't been checked yet is not dispositive even if this were actual sedition.Wow! 2021 Unregistered Foreign Agent used to be called a 'SPY"" back in the day!As is Matt Gaetz.

Give me a break.> can be ordered back to active duty and then be court-martialed under the UCMJ\s\sCitation needed.Treason. Slap his ass back in prison. For good.I’ll never forget how republicans turned their backs on the constitution to protect Trump.....I don't get this sentiment. Republicans have never cared about the constitution...or states rights...or shrinking the deficit...or law and order.\s\sThey care about power and exerting that power to gain more power. I think my point is that this behavior is not surprising at all.A pretty accurate indicator of how many actual ""conservatives"" are left in the GOP who have not been radicalized by Trump into anti-democracy anti-Constitution cultists at his beck and call.Party over country... yet the Dems are the unpatriotic ones.  \*Insert the most gigantic eye-roll here\*Lucky for them they mostly see Democrats as enemies of the country.Leasership character and honesty are values that are weak and diminished already in politics. These people could careless about Trump. They have a party firmly in his grasp and they pay fealty to him merely to protect their own positions and status.\s\sAs long as there is a bigger nut job waiting in the wings willing to firmly place lips to butt for the Trumps they will stand pat. Until those who vote Republican finally sour on this man...their representatives won't do so either.I'm shocked its that many to be honest with you.This is like the statistic ""50 percent of people admitted to lying in the past and the other 50 percent were liars.""538 gives dems a 69% chanceNice.Personally during a Presidential election cycle I can't get enough polls.  They're so exciting and always spot-on!That's good sarcasmHe’s been saying it for a long time.Adam Smith in the ""Wealth of Nations"" says: “The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents therefore would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not perhaps be anything very unreasonable. **It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense not only in proportion to their revenue but something more than in that proportion.**”\s\sThat's where Buffet learned the truth. It is taught as a fundamental in graduate economics and then ignored by the Ayn Rand types. But they aren't capitalists.Ayn Rand is HyperCapitalist. And Buffet who promoted health rotting CocaCola forever isn't exactly a paragon of virtue. Capitalism is primarily Concentration of Wealth which means State Oversight of Capitalism is necessary. Call me a Commie Leveler perhaps but actually I like Competition in business with moderate profits with high taxes on extreme wealth.  Much of our recent economic gains are a result of Government investment: Computers (1940s thru 1960s). Interstate Highways (Suburbia) Technology (Space Program). Those three alone were primed Not by usually Republican Rich people but by Government! DARPA anyone? The Internet!\s\sI suggest reading about the Erie Canal\sAmerica's first great government financed mixed Capitalist/Public enterprise that made New York the ""Empire State"".

I see Trump is no different.Your demands go unheard here trumbo boy now go cheat at golf you worthless sack of 💩.I couldn't believe him plugging the opening of his L.A. golf course on twitter on thre day the death toll topped 80000. Literally doesn't have a soul this man.Projection from the President to rally his stupid gun toting supporters to violence.If you count on the census and of age your vote should countYou do know that children are counted on the census right?It does not matter he would lose California either way He is just trying to change the news. Again.It does matter down ballot though.Let’s keep the statistics statisticing(yes I made up that word)but you know what I meanMail-in ballots shouldn’t count. Now poll-cast ballots shouldn’t count. I’m starting to think he’s trying to tamper with the election.[deleted]I understand how you feel. We have to be the change in the world we want to see. I decided it was time for me to run for public office.People should’ve taken to the streets ages ago.That POS tries for a third term I’ll come from Oregon armed.[deleted]He won't have the option. The end of terms are hard and fast and the blue states won't let him on the ballot a third time.Over on r/conservative they’re advocating that CNN and MSNBC be banned from reporting on the White House.  It’s funny that the “Party of Reagan” is pretty much demanding Pravda at this point.But Obama?!Sad thing is... theres not much we can do. The only thing we could do to stop him is to get him out of office by voting Biden in. \s\sBut... the democrats are pretty split right now from Bernie dropping out. This is going to be a 2016 dejavu where people are not gonna vote thinking that theres no way trump is gonna win. People are not gonna vote because Bernie isnt the one running and the only passion they had was for bernie. \s\sAnd by people I mean democratic people. I wouldnt call Republicans people at this point. They've sold their soul to satan so I'd call them little shit turds.[deleted]It’s true. We had been lucky that the boy king had not had to face a true national emergency.   That luck ran out.Only he is still president.  He still has authority he is still in charge and he still has the full support of his party.  \s\sI read the article and I see his point but nothing changes for Trump.  He'll just keep in lying while people die and his supporters will just blame the Democrats.  Or gays or abortion or whatever.  And when the election rolls around he is not guaranteed to lose.  And if he loses he will not leave peacefully.  Nothing is over.As long as he can blame everything on brown or black people his minions will support him. They will support him as their farms and businesses are foreclosed as their jobs vanish the stock market (and their savings) crumbles as Russians call the shots on foreign policy as America's reputation abroad disintegrated and even as their children's education and health care are dismantled.  They will support him because they hate people of color more than they love their farms businesses savings Country and even their children. \s\sHate conquers all.Trump could fool around with a prostitute in the White House bump into “the button” accidentally launch a nuclear attack on Mississippi and his supporters would still insist “Trump is doing a great job.”They said Hillary would whip him how did that turn out we need all my brother and sisters from Bernie's campaign a large black and brown turn out  suburban woman's vote to win in the electoral college.One can only hope.His failures need to be condensed into devastating 30 minute campaign commercials by the Democratic nomineeYes. Or regular 3-5 minute video’s each depicting a different issue. Because concentration span and a general “what the hell will it be this time” feeling.>The coronavirus is quite likely to be the Trump presidency’s inflection point when everything changed when the bluster and ignorance and shallowness of America’s 45th president became undeniable an empirical reality as indisputable as the laws of science or a mathematical equation. \s\s""Surely this will be the end of Drumpf"" says opinion magazine that has been cramming this article in between their daily ""innocuous thing you enjoy is actually problematic"" clickbait for the last 3 years.Pretty good chance he has the virus.

The case that Manafort gave Russkies polling data has been made. The case that Russkies returned a strategy and tactics to win 2016 is still TBD.  \sI find it a lot easier to buy that Russkies told Trump how to win over Bannon and Kushner figured it out on their own.I don't need the Russkies or the Brainless Trust to explain things.\s\sThe former guy was a scam artist and he found his marks.It took me three reads to get your meaning. I kept reading it as “...told Trump how to win over Bannon and Kushner” and couldn’t make sense of the last part. Not saying anything is wrong with your grammar just weird how the brain interprets things.Really?  This has been up for 14 hours and not one pee pee tape comment? \s\sAll I know is that Brass Against needs to take steps to prevent Trump from showing at their concerts from here on out.How much more proof of what a POS traitor he is do they need. Arrest the douchebag.at this point bringing up the Steele dossier does nothing for anyone.Trump did not prevail in 2016 due to Russian Interference. \s\sThere is significant evidence that the Russians took steps to interfere with the election. \s\sBoth can be true.But did Trump use Russia to get an advantage? I say yes. And I’d be willing to bet that the GRU gave Trump a clear advantage. The Trump circle met with Russians over 100 times. There is so much involved with Trump/Russia that the public doesn’t yet know.\s\sThe best piece of evidence for me is the KT McFarland email: https://www.businessinsider.com/emails-kt-mcfarland-russia-thrown-election-to-trump-flynn-2017-12[deleted]Kinda want the dems to not talk about trump at all \s\sTalk about the democratic agenda and priorities.

MERRICK GARLAND HAS TO GO AS AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND BE REPLACED WITH A CAREER INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS WORKED AT THE DOJ FOR SOME TIME WE NEED AN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT  WILL INDICT SOMEONE NOT PUSH THE CASES TO A GRAND JURY TO DO THEIR WORK AND IF MERRICK GARLAND DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR HIM TO INDICT THIS GUY THEN I DON'T THINK HE'LL THINK THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN ANY CASE AND IF WE ARE LUCKY HE WILL PUSH THEM OVER TO A GRAND JURY.I disagree.

At least there now is some real evidence when all the HRC shills insist there was absolutely nothing about the election rigged.\s\sConnect the dots for us shills will you? How did the claims made by Donna Brazile (whose word you all suddenly now trust (I'm sure the fact that her revelations confirm your bias has nothing to do with it)) lead to a rigged election. Some commentary from Emma Vigeland:\s\shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCNrXomzv5U&t=0sI hate that people keep calling this money laundering.  It's not.\s\sAt the heart of it this is about the presumptive nominee taking the money meant for the *actual* nominee before the fact.  Not really on the up-and-up of course but not exactly the bombshell misconduct it's being made out to be.\s\sWe need to keep in mind that 1) it's not really clear how much if at all this hurt Bernie.  He always had and relied upon his own fundraising infrastructure which partly because of his status as an Independent caucusing with the Democrats (rather than a true Democrat) was wholly separate from anything impacted by this revelation.  That 2) Hillary had long since been the party's presumptive nominee and was nearly unanimously agreed-upon by the establishment. Her sole opposition had merely *caucused* with the party and his campaign was never meant as anything more than a protest by his own admission.  And that 3) this was in return for paying off the $24 million of debt the party had been left with by President Obama.\s\sNow I'm not saying this isn't naughty but the question is really *how* naughty.  All considered this seems more on the side of ""a little naughty"" than ""very naughty.""\s\s(now to sit back and bathe in the downvotes)This deserves a Pakman livestream.^ This>The Saturday morning after the convention in July I called Gary Gensler the chief financial officer of Hillary’s campaign.

Officials from Hillary’s campaign had taken a look at the DNC’s books. Obama left the party $24 million in debt—$15 million in bank debt and more than $8 million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign—and had been paying that off very slowly. Obama’s campaign was not scheduled to pay it off until 2016. Hillary for America (the campaign) and the Hillary Victory Fund (its joint fundraising vehicle with the DNC) had taken care of 80 percent of the remaining debt in 2016 about $10 million and had placed the party on an allowance.\s\s>The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that **in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC Hillary would control the party’s finances strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing budgeting data analytics and mailings.**\s\s>I told Bernie I had found Hillary’s Joint Fundraising Agreement. I explained that the cancer was that she had exerted this control of the party long before she became its nominee. Had I known this I never would have accepted the interim chair position but here we were with only weeks before the election.\s\s>**Bernie took this stoically. He did not yell or express outrage. Instead he asked me what I thought Hillary’s chances were.** The polls were unanimous in her winning but what he wanted to know was my own assessment?\s\s>**I had to be frank with him. I did not trust the polls I said. I told him I had visited states around the country and I found a lack of enthusiasm for her everywhere. I was concerned about the Obama coalition and about millennials.**The ""Bernie wasn't even a democrat"" defense is the go-to argument of DNC dogmatic supporters to say ""nothing to see here the Democratic party is a private organization"".\s\sOh I thought they were a political party and their main intent was to include as many Americans as possible.

Although Bernie gave it a good run let's remember that he isn't a Democrat but caucuses with Democrats usually. If Hillary bailed the DNC out with good financing and benefited with a bias to get the nomination seems a fair trade. Bernie should become a Democrat and fundraise for the party to expect equal treatment. And let's remember she lost. Scandal is minor compared to all the other stuff. \sFor as much as Trump and his cronies appear utterly incompetent if Hillary's/DNC's lawyer decided to continue funding the Steele dossier after the Republicans punted it it is beyond incompetent that he didn't give it to Hillary to unleash the same weekend as the Billy Bush ""grab them by the Pussy"" tape. \sShe needed the dossier that weekend after Comey ruined her. Lol. >If Hillary bailed the DNC out with good financing and benefited with a bias to get the nomination seems a fair trade.\s\sIt is not a fair trade. It was against the DNC bylaws was not known by the officers who were supposed to have to agree to it and allowed the Clinton campaign to funnel money from state races into its own general election coffers. This last part was known at the time and had severe consequences on electoral efforts: https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670\s\sIf the general election coin had landed heads instead of tails we would have gotten a President Clinton with nearly the exact same party makeup in state legislatures governorships prosecutors judges and US Congress members.

The Republican states are just like the Confederacy was back then. They are anti federal government yet they rely on the most federal funding because their population is so resistant to taxation. Once that federal funding goes dry because they seceded the air force craters all the military bases and assets in those states and they cannot engage in interstate commerce for things like food and electricity because the federal interstate highways will be blockaded they'll starve and freeze to death while being unable to defend themselves with small arms against drones and tanks. They'll be begging to be a part of the United States again because they can't tax their people to fund a war effort or secure resources.Not really cuz the stupid half is too poor and sick to pull anything off. This is more like a ""if I cant have it noone can"" mentality where they drag the whole country down with them.did not some vacationing facists try to takeover congress around this time last year?Democracy is dead in America. The fact that an outgoing president can openly lie about election fraud that doesn't exist and incite an armed insurrection to overthrow democracy and illegally and unconstitutionally reinstate himself as a dictator without being immediately locked up for life or publicly executed means there is no future for democracy in America.The bad part is the DOJ seems to be sitting on its hands and not doing anything about this.  Why are Trump and his ilk not indicated already?    They have enough to get them on and that includes the ones in Congress who were part of it.  \s\sThey let them get away with this then next time it will be much worse.  They keep saying January 6th was only practice.  The Democrats are so weak.  Just like Obama did not prosecute Bush and his crooks.Not just face no consequence he is the front runner againAnd the best part is that it's based on a complete fabrication. What a sad time we live in where a man's fragile ego can destroy the strongest democracy in the world. Democracies are easily broken.Trump gave every indication long before the election that if he did not win he would not accept the results.  Yes he is a dictator and he still has a following and control over the Republicans.And that fabrication is that actually democracy has been lost the democrats have stolen it with fraud. We need to counter their fascism with our own fascism.I do not know about a civil war but we are heading for the end of our democracy.   We are heading to authoritarian fascism.  The worse type as well; National Socialism (Nazism). \s\sWe have a worthless Democratic party which does nothing and a weak worthless president who does not want to do anything for the people either.

Trump and his ilk should be in jail by now but there seems like nothing is happening.At this point if there are no consequences then it’s going to happen again.

Lie.Right wingers supposed to go to work and do their job no matter how bad . What happened to that?You'd think that if they were really as demoralized as they claim then police officers would be demanding something like more mandatory paid time off reduce the time they need to qualify for retirement (i.e. 20 years instead of 30) mandate that their departments give them mandatory psychiatric care/annual evaluations etc.\s\sBut we're not seeing that.Maybe then they weren't cut out to be cops.They really should put a limit on how long someone can be a cop. Cops become jaded and carry a lot of baggage of the stuff they have dealt with. They carry that into every interaction they have in and out of uniform.I say I wish they wereWell when the mayor of Chicago Seattle and Baltimore all attest to cops leaving spreading their departments thin due to budget cuts I don’t think police are all in this conspiracy theory to say that they are all struggling. This labor statistic you folks are using is a bit misleading.  \s\sFirst of all it is probably true that cops aren’t leaving all police departments on a broad scale. It is also true as this articles states is that there are some departments that are struggling due to budget cuts and when departments are struggling with budget cuts that affects personnel level and when there aren’t enough officers that delays response times like they attest to in the Denver police department. \s\sSecondly it states that 4000 police officers overall left the profession. When you talk about 0.9% of 600000+ law enforcement officers that’s still a significant decrease especially if those losses are concentrated in larger departments with higher crime. This doesn’t even take into account to those who have left and rejoined other departments. \s\sOne way to interpret this would be that larger police departments in cities like Seattle or Chicago are losing officers while smaller police departments are making gains - as it states in this study -  https://www.policeforum.org/workforcesurveyjune2021\s\s“The reduction in hiring was relatively modest with a 5% overall decrease in the hiring rate among responding departments. Smaller agencies actually saw an increase in hiring while larger departments experienced dramatic reductions. “\s\sLook I understand it is pleasing to ourselves orient our views in destroying a common enemy. And when we do that we become blinded by our biases. But on the left we really need to do better in approaching this police brutality issues because it is one we absolutely suck at.Since the cops in Chicago avoid any kind of work a smaller force wouldn't have that much of a impact. \sThey put a lot of effort into destroying the trust of the public.

It's possible turnout for Dems is higher in part because they dislike how Republicans are behaving.By rare glimpse do you mean politicians work for their donors not their constituents?You pretty clearly didn't listen to the call didn't you?\s\sJoe Manchin basically threatened republicans saying he will change the filibuster if they don't compromiseaudio releases of Joe Manchin getting stabbed in the back by Republicans... yeah this got leaked for groundwork for filibuster reform lmao.\s\s\sAnyone who is so mad that like Joe Manchin shows corruption in deal-making like how new to politics are you?At this point I kind of hope for a revolution so that pieces of garbage like Joe Manchin could get what’s coming to him.Unfortunately the ""revilutionists"" are wearing red hats and led primarily by propagandaDon't be ridiculous revolutions don't punish people like Joe Manchin. It'll certainly put much worse figures than Manchin in place and likely with less accountability than Manchin currently has.*I want all the people I claim to care about to suffer immense pain and loss because Joe Manchin won't cancel all student loan debt and raise the minimum wage to $25 (damn LA/Brooklyn is expensive lol)*I don't understand the Manchin hate.  We have a democrat from West Virginia.  No matter how moderate he is that should make us really happy.  A regular Dem or progressive candidate in WV would have NO chance of winning.[deleted]I thought this was a painting of Joe Manchin at first glance.Same thing in schools!

0,AmericanPolitics,centrist,184,"Of course they do they are the opposition and don’t want change that go against their ideals.Gop wins by doing nothing.  Keeping the status quo is a win.  They arent dumb.[removed]There are a lot of ""Of course the GOP doesn't want to pass Democratic legislation"" comments.\s\sThat's an *absurd* position to take.  \s\sGoverning requires our elected representatives to try to work on policy that makes our society work better.  That's the entire point of having a government.  That doesn't change if you aren't in the majority.  For example look at various bipartisan groups of senators in the last 15 years; they understand their job is to work to find solutions.\s\sEvery congressional representative should be doing that. The only difference between the majority and the minority is that the majority has more swing they can push harder to get more of what they want.\s\sWhen congressional leaderships says as Sen. McConnell has repeatedly said that their own goal is to stop the other side they are *abandoning* their duty to our nation and to you.  \s\sAnd before anyone responds with ""The Democrats do it too"" let me stop you - it doesn't matter who's done it in the past what matters is it's happening right now and you yes you should be disgusted by congressional representatives who's primary goal isn't to govern but to help their own political career by obstructing governance.I disagree with you it is not absurd at all in my opinion. What happened in the past lead us to where we are today.  You can’t be ok with obstructionism when it suits your political beliefs and then be outraged and demand outrage when the other side does it as well. This is not meant to be a direct attack against you it’s meant as a general statement of the demeanor of our electorate.\s\sThere is a difference between being disgusted about something and calling out the fact that both sides do it. I am absolutely disgusted in how both sides of our government operate and would love to find a way to penalize them for not working together. For example withhold pay and the 600 days of vacation they get every year if they can’t pass a budget as an example. \s\sHowever. That doesn’t mean I am going to sit here and let people peddle articles like this as examples of how the Republicans are evil and working against the “will of the people” the democrats proposals are liked by the “vast majority” of the people etc. This is pure propagandist statements and manipulating the facts\s\sJust trying to give a little perspective on why my position is that both sides have and will continue to be obstructionist when they are not in power.What should also be considered is the priorities of each side.  The GOP's singular legislative accomplishment under Trump was tax cuts mostly for the rich.  They were enormously unpopular and the 52 GOP members in the Senate represented about 40 million fewer people than the 48 Dem/Ind members of the Senate.  Simply put obstruction here would have been warranted ***because almost no one but GOP politicians and their wealthy donors wanted this legislation.***   (they were only able to pass it through budget reconciliation) \s\sThe GOP routinely tries to cut federal funding for planned parenthood.  Enormously unpopular and thus blocked by Democrats. (and even some GOP Senators)\s\sMeanwhile the Democrats are proposing infrastructure that would not only pay for roads bridges trains airports and ports but also money for the care industry as boomers hit their mid-70s.  Again ***enormously popular*** and again blockaded by 50 GOP senators who represent some 45 million fewer constituents than the democratic senators.\s\sUnder Obama some 88% of the public was in favor of a federal gun-control bill following Newtown.   The democrats including Manchin supported it and the GOP blocked it.\s\sNow we can fight all day about the efficacy of defunding planned parenthood versus affirming women's bodily choice.  We can disagree on background checks infrastructure funding green energy subsidies etc.\s\sBut what is NOT debatable is the popularity of the Democratic policies versus the popularity of the GOP politicians' proposals.  In short the GOP is consistently on the wrong side of the popularity equation and they are essentially engaging in minority rule against the strong objections of the VAST majority of the American public.  We can no longer overlook that.  At a certain point people will stop believing in a system that gives consistent disproportionate power to an unpopular minority.  When that happens Democracy in this country crumbles.\s\sThe ""both sidesing"" here is disgusting.  There is a clear villain here and it's the GOP.Extremely good points you brought up here especially the last one addressing both side-ism 👍\s\sHere take a poor man’s gold award 🥇[removed]Is this news to anyone? The Reps are using the Obama playbook.I mean... Duh. Tell me something we don't all know.This is the natural result of “tit for tat” political polarization. Politicians don’t think “how can I help my constituents/citizens” they think “how can I fuck the other side to gain political points today”That's how Mitch McConnell thinks. He calls it ""the long view.""I don’t even know why this is news of course they want to obstruct his agenda they (Republicans)have come out and said this many times over the last six months.\s\sJust like the Dems said they would fight the agenda when Trump was elected in 2017 \s\shttps://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/315238-schumer-democrats-will-fight-trump-tooth-and-nail\s\sOr how the Republicans said they would fight Obama’s agenda\s\shttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-republicans-plan-for-the-new-president/\s\sOr how the democrats said they would fight Bush’s agenda \s\shttps://www.foxnews.com/story/dems-plan-to-obstruct-bush-agenda\s\sIf you don’t get my point literally every single presidency over the last 30 years has dealt with this hostility from the other party. It’s nothing new and they are not shy about saying it. \s\sWhat is new is these Self styled “news” organizations on both sides trying to style the conversation in a way to drum up controversy and show that the other side is pure evil fighting against righteousness.Except democrats tried to get proposals through congress to help people throughout the pandemic and the GOP obstructed it.  You’re just wrong to “both sides” this.  Only one party legislates for the will of the people.Members of each side of the political spectrum always poopoo on centrists complaining that we never take a side we never drive change. \s\sCentrists as a group should come together and focus our desire for change and resolve the systematic gaps that lead to the lack of bipartisanship obliterate the drivers that keep the stink inside the cesspools of congress oppose “cheating” through gerrymandering push for rank choice voting and support both secure voting and right for every citizen to vote. \s\sThe left benefits from a broken system. The right benefits from a broken system. If the centrists don’t care than who will?Please stop presenting it as if centrists are the lone heroes. That’s a sickening and arrogant vote.I never realized this was a secret. ""Conservatives support keeping things the way they are now and not changing"" is basically a redundant phrase.Well tbf they are more for repealing the way things were not let's keep it.As if that wasn't the Democrat mantra the previous four years.The Failed Trump Tax Cut was passed without a single Democratic vote. The Republicans didn't do anything after that.\s\sWhere's my Donnicare? What happened to Infrastructure Week? **I thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall so why did Trump shut down the government twice to extort the American taxpayers?**Don’t “both sides” this shit.  You sound ridiculous.Conservative politician would prefer that leftist stuff doesn't get done and that policy is left to the free market or at least state and local governments rather than federal mandate there's nothing controversial hereDefine leftist.

Am I missing something?Not even just leftist stuff. The quote would literally apply to *all* legislation just to make Democrats look bad.Yeah except according to the GOP leftist = anything the majority of the population supports apparently.Democrats do not create leftist policies lolYou don't think obstructing the voters' will is controversial because you are all for cheating.

Shocking.The democrats do the same thing when the gop is in power.

How is that not helping constituents?  Their entire domestic platform is about helping g a shrinking middle and lower class.  Please read more diverse news sources.""The time for bipartisanship is over"" is only the case because people have gone off the deep end and refuse to admit it. If they came back to reality and started from there they could find common ground. Impossible to do so when everything you think about the other side is hyperbole and scare tactics bullshit and you invent your own reality.Normal politics.  So what?A functioning democracy which that must represent multiple different political beliefs is predicated upon compromise in order to get anywhere. This just goes to show how dysfunctional our government has become and an ostensible failure of the two party system.\s\sThe purpose of our government isn't to stall all progress so that one party looks worse. Both sides shouldn't feel such hostility towards one another that even working across the aisle is unthinkable and unacceptable.[deleted]Commondreams lol propaganda websiteThis is not normal politics in most countries.

I don’t blame the GOP at all for taking this route.\s\sAt the GOP's insistence not because municipalities and states can't use the money.  Though there are some GOP governors who are refusing COVID $ for political reasons which is grotesque to say the least (they did the same thing with federal subsidies for the ACA -- ask the middle class who are squeezed by health insurance premiums in red states feel about that).I don’t know about y’all but I’m ready to scroll through another divisive thread with insults and [deleted] comments as if we can somehow influence the investigation from the internet.\s\sJust take the news passively stay informed let the investigation play out and then we can argue the results.[deleted]Rolling stone isn't exactly a bastion of truth but whatever.I’m waiting to see it confirmed by someone else too but while they have had high profile face plants majority of Rolling Stones reporting has been legit.I mean it's interesting but isn't the rolling stone a magazine not a news sourceThat has a horrible history of falsifying stories - more recently the ivermectin story. \s\sJust have to wait and see how it plays out at this pointOkay but where is the proof? How do we know these claims arnt just made up like the other “anonymous” sources stories that have been occurring lately (like the Atlantic story)?In the article the two sources say they plan to testify publicly along with sharing this information with congressional investigators. We'll just have to see how this develops.The trump rally is not the actual riot. They are saying they planned the rally…..which was peaceful. Unless we are going to start locking people up for planning a peaceful protest then this is a nonstory pretending to be something important for clicks.Get out of here with your common sense!\s\sClearly you are correct. The media is conflating planning for the rally with “insurrection” and the usual suspects are running with it. Let’s see what the actual testimony is.Some of the representatives named include Majorie Taylor Greene Paul Gosar Lauren Boebert among many others. Gosar's team reportedly encouraged the organizers by promising they would receive a blanket pardon for their actions.Complete bullshit. If you think this would have happened and the detail not leaked by Biden bureaucrats you’re crazy.Rent free.Honestly anything I see coming from Rolling Stone I do not read or give second glance. Their reporting is atrocious. When and if an article comes our from a different news source I may give it a glance. Preferably by a trusted investigative journalist.[deleted]I suppose neither was 9/11.\s\sWhether the planning included the attack is interesting and let's see what people will testify.That is literally not what the article says.\s\sYour title is bullshit as are you.Putin wants þe US to collapse and þis regardless of its truþfulness helps in þat goal. We should not just blindly believe it nor should we blindly dismiss it.Sound advice.I'm mostly just wondering why you're using a thorn which hasn't been a part of the English language for a really long time. Like...are you using some kind of Icelandic keyboard or did you take the time to purposefully memorize the codepoint? I ain't even mad. I'm just confused.While I wouldn’t be surprised at all if Russia wanted Trump to win I find it hard to believe that something like this gets “leaked”. I think Russia released this because it further undermines confidence in democracy (just like the Russia investigation) and increases paranoia about the effectiveness of Russian election interference. For Democrats rush to call Hunter Biden’s laptop “Russian disinformation” (even though most of the contents were verified to be real) they sure don’t seem to be very skeptical about this. But it works both ways. \s\sThe one thing I can say for certain is Russia would LOVE for the US and the world to think Russia decides US elections. I think if Russia had anything that compromising on Trump they would’ve used it while he was still president.Russia mixes truth and fiction all the time.  That's how they help make their drops more plausible. I'm just curious about the pee tape now considering Cohen and a Russian mobster discussed stopping it from.comong out back on 2016. The mobster later said the tape didn't exist which makes it all the stranger they'd discuss stopping something that never existed   but that's how the Russians roll. You're never supposed to know what's realYeah it seems highly implausible that a memo from Putin's meeting with all the very top Russian dogs was somehow able to fall into the hands of some unknown Russian Edward-Snowden-wannabe particularly given Putin's lack of hesitation to deal ruthlessly with those who interfere with his game plan.\s\sIn any event even if Russia was able to influence the 2016 US election by way of using social media to spread misinformation and undermine challengers to the throne Trump hoped to sit on the US and the world are now very much aware of this dodgy subversive technique and I highly doubt it could be effectively used by Russia again.\s\sIn which case Putin has played his Trump card (ha ha) and will now fade back into his normal pre-Trump obscurity.This is my take as wellHas anyone but the Guardian reported on this? This reporter has [published](https://archive.ph/2019.12.17-212925/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-guardian-offered-a-bombshell-story-about-paul-manafort-it-still-hasnt-detonated/2018/12/03/60e38182-f71c-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html) unverifiable information related to Russia and Trump before.Pretty sure someone loaded a different media site to a much bigger sub and it was highly upvoted.\s\sEdit:\s\sThere are quite a few articles: https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/07/15/trump-kompromat-claimed-report-says-kremlin-documents-show-putin-conspiring-for-billionaire/Dumpfs finished this time we promiseHere we go again. This will go like every other fake news story about Trump. It will eventually go away but nobody apologizes for posting fake news.On another similar post a user commented that basically it's all things that we already knew about from the Mueller investigation. There's also no ""leaks"" from Russia Putin is just doing the usual to make America weaker by increasing the division and social tension of the country. The secret services likely already knew about this. It's not fake news it's just mostly meaningless news.Could you elaborate on why you believe this to be fake news?Russia’s support for the Trump campaign has been confirmed in every way possible including criminal convictions for direct collusion. It happened. It’s still happening.\s\sI feel like the only person in the world who actually read the entire Mueller Report.The walls are closing in. This is the beginning of the end. Mueller is coming. \s\sBeen through all this before I’m not gonna hold my breath that this time it’s legitDemocrats and the lying press just can't let this bullshit go\s\sIt is absolutely psychotic. Just face reality the nation fucking despises that crooked lying bastard HillaryWe need more benghazi hearings to get to the bottom of this damnit!Go back to /r/conservative please.Lol dude you're supposed to say ""fake news"" for plausible deniability.

I live in a very red state and this is the first I'm hearing about it.Have you heard of January 6th and dozens of other violent right wing protests?The majority of Republicans believe or at least say they believe that there was massive election fraud and the election was stolen.Majority or vocal minority?I talk to Trump supporters every day and have never one of them say anything about resorting to violence.I like that you are smarter than the entire department of homeland securityGood ol' anecdotal evidence.If Rollingstone says so.Better than faux news.It's DHS saying so.I feel as though they are taking a handful of idiots on twitter and saying it's a national problem.  Who of consequence is demanding violence if he isn't reinstated?Remember jan 6th? This is serious.What are they gonna do throws rocks and tweet until their thumbs bleed? Same shit happened when trump won against Hillary you had teenagers and collage students cry and scream into their phone about “how he isn’t my president” and even said they where going to kill themselves or the president. Now some angry ppl again talk about violence as if they really gon step to it. This shit blown out of proportion if some really step to it they gonna get smoked.Still waiting for the mass exodus to Canada. Nova Scotia welcomes Hillary supporters. Always room on the couch.While the electoral college stole the election away from the dems in 2016 Conservatives attacked the capitol on january 6th even though they lost. That's the difference. They're terrorists.Yeah. However the left is known for being bigger wimps and wusses than the right. Especially the extreme ends. And the far left has fewer weapons.\s\sSo typically when it comes to violence especially against people I think it is far to worry about the far right more than the far left.But guys it's not a cult.Based on this comment section this subreddit is just Trump supporters pretending to not be Trump supporters.

You can't hide behind beliefs in conspiracy theory to cover for behavior repugnant to our country.Lots of Trump defenders for a centrist subreddit.It makes no sense to me why a centrist would support Trump but as someone who has paid attention to his entire campaign that was obvious from the campaign trail. Remember when Trump wanted his rallies to rough up protestors drag them into the cold without their jackets mocked people with disabilities refusing to say he would accept election results etc. That should have disqualified him from the presidency. Look what has happened to our society since then and can you honestly say that we are not worse off for it? Political violence is like a genie once you let it out of the bottle there is no returning to before.Welcome to the party pal.\s\sI joined thinking it would be a sub that calls bullshit on both sides and instead it's ""I'm a centrist because I hold 99 hyper conservative stances but 1 slightly liberal one...""lots of fascists for a centrist subreddit.\s\sI've said it plenty of times you either believe we should have elections or you don't.

Tough on the border tough on crime (but also open to bipartisan justice reform) pro business but also willing to spend a lot of money to help people in times of need and to have government spend on important things like Infrastructure as well as not pandering to the religious right on things like gay marriageAm I wrong to think ALL centrists should be against something like this? As a centrist we are the swing voters who decide an election not Republicans or Democrats. Of course the Democrats will vote blue and the Republicans will vote red that is a given. The centrists decided against team red this time around and that is exactly whose voice is being countered with these election fraud bs. Every other political issue is bullshit if we don't get a choice. This is the number 1 issue as far as I am concerned.You're not going to convince people who hate America to suddenly become centrists and stand fo continuing democracy.  Next time if Trump is successful these people will say the same shit.... ""It was legal""... ""It's not Trumps fault his supporters murdered half the senate he had to call a national emergency and overturn the election""... ""the democrats didn't give him any choice""\s\sThey see Putin in Russia and Xi in China and are desperate to create that same thing here.

There's some ambiguity as to what is and isn't a centrist but at its core it should recognize that Democracy is a cornerstone of America> Am I wrong to think ALL centrists should be against something like this?\s\sAgainst what?\s\sThe Rolling Stone article (and headline) is an extremely editorialized account of what Mark Meadows turned over.  They call it a how-to guide for overthrowing a democracy but a less biased party might just call it suggestions on how to proceed during an election compromised by fraud or foreign interference.  It's definitely not the smoking gun Rolling Stone and a handful of other very liberal media outlets are insisting it is. \s\sI voted for Joe Biden and see nothing that makes me believe there was any fraud committed.  Audits recounts challenges etc. have supported Biden's win.  But I also see little evidence that Donald Trump plotted to ""End American Democracy"" much less directed people to storm The Capitol.2024 swing voters: ""Trump did try to end American Democracy but the price of apples went up 5 cents under Biden so I'm leaning towards Trump.""Lol this entirely!Says a lot about how awful Democrats are at politics that they let this happen doesn't it.As much as a fucking weirdo Pence is he would have never done the things outlined in the one slide.\s\sHe actually did the opposite and certified the results of the election putting to rest the whole voter fraud bullshit.\s\sActually there was voter fraud committed almost entirely by Republicans lol.I’m very hesitant to buy into clickbait from Rolling Stones. They really don’t have much to stand on in terms of integrity these days. \s\sIf this is actually true I’d like trump to be brought up on charges of treason. \s\sI’ll need much more evidence than RS claiming something.Just because OP chose to share the RS article on the topic doesn't mean RS is the only source.

They are reporting on documents from the Jan. 6 congressional committee. This isn't anonymous sources.HOLY FUCK THANK YOU!!! How can people not see through this absolute hogwash?!? TDS is a hell of a drug… it’s a strong hallucinogen apparentlyUghhh. First off it was not a slide show “on how to end American democracy” the hyperbole is not necessary or helpful. Secondly no national emergency was declared soooo… fake news?my hot take is that elections are good and we should have them[deleted]This routine hyperbole is the cause of the division.>fake news?\s\sFake news from the rolling stone? No way! I am shocked!Its Rolling Stone. The people who bring you fine reporting like fake rape story on UVA campus and ivermectin overdose patients cause delays for gun shot victims getting into hospitals in Oklahoma fake story. Of course it's fake news.I agree that the hyperbole isn't helpful but this clearly doesn't qualify as 'fake news.' Not that anything actually does qualify for that ridiculous phrase. \s\sThe fact that a powerpoint was circulating see detailing that very idea going over how to delay certification/the peaceful transfer of power is sadly not surprising knowing what we know now but nonetheless was still an affront to our democracy. \s\sThese people are hiding behind 'executive privilege' that doesn't actually exist at this point and hopefully the courts will enforce that. Once that goes away I'm sure that much more like this will come to light showing just how much was being contemplated/done to try to overturn the election.This is correct it is all hyperbole. What should be considered is Trump requested the National guard 3 days prior to Jan 6 and was turned down by Pelosi The Capital Police did the same and were turned down by Pelosi. With all that went on no National Emergency was declared.I saw rolling stone and was like.. nope. Not falling for it.> Secondly no national emergency was declared soooo… fake news?\s\sDoes the article say that a national emergency was declared?The attempt to overthrow democracy following the 2020 election was clumsy. The GOP took the lessons they learned and are actively working to dismantle the guardrails that got in the way. GOP controlled legislatures are setting it up so that in 2024 they can ignore the vote by calling it fraudulent and appoint the electors they want. They are replacing the GOP election officials that upheld the rule of law and the Constitution with people that say they would not have certified the election. In Georgia Purdue is running for Governor on that promise.How does that administration get the benefit of the doubt in any matter here? At least read the slides before you start questioning if it's legitimate.Reading the slides made me realize that Trump had the authority to call a national emergency and halt everything so why didn't he?I'm pretty sure the PowerPoint wasn't called How to End American Democracy.....Probably not that’s just what the power point was about so all good amirite?Rolling stone is your source?there is quite a difference between bias and lies. sure they are more left wing biased but the reporting is highly factual.https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rolling-stone/rollingstone may not be the top 10 media but they sure don't make shit up.If stuff like this keeps coming out it might be Democrats who become the biggest 2nd Amendment supporters.The unexpected side effect of trumpism is more left and center arming themselves.This is some huge hysteria\s\sWe've got a republican administration that had some legally questionable but not at face value completely absurd legal theories. Nothing wrong with that. If anything happened it would have been determined by the SCOTUS to be allowed or not allowed. And if the SCOTUS allowed it it wouldn't be ""ending American democracy"" just ""yet another thing like the electoral college or Senate or gerrymandering that some liberals complain about despite being perfectly legal""Sub is turning into r/democrats or r/politicsNo r/centrist isn't left wing your just blinded by your allegiance to a demagogue and the cult of spite towards your fellow Americans he ushered in. You can't see that the ""emperor has no clothes"" when it obvious to the rest of us. \s\sIn all my life of paying attention to politics there was never a presidential candidate to encourage political violence like Donald Trump did on the campaign trail in 2015. Look where we are at now at each other's throats and for what so we can install an incompetent buffoon as dictator? \s\sCentrist can mean lots of different things but one thing it cannot mean is anti-democratic. You are a centrist precisely because you get a vote. If there was not democracy there would not be centrists.What is the content of the PowerPoint? \s\sWas it a brief showing how hate groups like Antifa and BLM are trying to tear down democracy? \s\sHard to believe it would be a Trump admin “plan” to dismantle the country vs an update to the admin on what was currently going on in the streets.Here's a link to the full slide show.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20210716135230if\_/https://www.ingersolllockwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/voter-fraud.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716135230if_/https://www.ingersolllockwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/voter-fraud.pdf) \s\sIt looks like it was done by a 12-year old for a school project.  Most of it is just unsubstantiated conspiracies about how the election was stolen.  I think the RollingStone's title is quite misleading.You know you lack critical thinking skills when you ask a question that is literally answered in the link being posted.Hard to believe but the article shows the actual slides and it actually is the plan to dismantle the country. Literally Trump had failed to meet even the lowest of expectations.This actually just made me so sad to read. This subreddit makes me lose faith in humanity every time I’m on it.Why do people still believe this sort of headline garbage with no sort of evidence? Have we not seen enough of these turn out to be absolutely nothing yet?What other sources did you check to see if the story is accurate?Have any other sources corroborated this?Have you read the article?[sure](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mark-meadows-trump-capitol-riot-powerpoint-b1973809.html)I thought this was r/centrist…?Hard to be a centrist if you don't get a choice as that is the very point of being a centrist. Never forget that we who are not committed to a party and are the true deciders. What Trump is doing isn't an attack on the shoe in votes for blue it is an attack on centrists who tipped the scales in favor of his removal.I voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. In fact I would vote for him again in 2024 if the vote came down to either him or Biden(This is assuming that I don't end up feeling any better about Biden in 2024 than I currently do which is admittedly a very large assumption to make. A lot can happen in 3 years.).\s\sThat being said this powerpoint is just an extension of the same garbage rhetoric he was pushing between Nov. 2020 and Jan. 2021. He lost the election and needed to quit pushing this crap about how the election was stolen from him and from all his supporters.\s\sTrump was pushing for legal action at the time because he wasn't convinced that the election was fairly decided. That's fair. What's not fair is to use your platform as POTUS to tell the American people that the other party stole their votes.\s\sWas there fair reason to be concerned about the legitimacy about the 2020 election? Yes. It was not a particularly secure election. The mail-in voting system was never designed to function at the capacity that it did in 2020 and there was more opportunity for fraud in that election than there ever has been in my lifetime. That doesn't make it appropriate for the sitting president to blatantly tell the American people that the election was stolen though. It was completely out of line and that sort of rhetoric is borderline tyrannical. Based on the slides that I read in the tweet in this article the options that were proposed in that powerpoint are just disgusting and never should have been presented to the White House staff.\s\s**P.S.** Rolling Stone can go screw themselves for trying to manipulate people with such an idiotic and overly dramatic headline. They're playing that sleazy game that the media loves to play where they know that most people are only going to read the headline so instead of delivering a concise and accurate summary they instead write it as a needlessly radicalized politically charged opinion that's designed to demonize someone for you before you even get to read the article.Isn’t it funny how conservatives are all focusing on mail in voting which has a long and successful history but always ignore the fact that Republicans kept requiring the use of insecure unauditable voting machines and that in many places where the use of such machines was replaced by machines with paper trails the votes in those areas shifting significantly to democrats?I haven’t looked at the article but somehow I get the impression it’s claim is exaggerated.\s\sI mean granted it’s Trump but the idea of someone literally passing around a PowerPoint on how to overthrow democracy seems really really goofy.\s\sOn an off-note I hope this ain’t another Jan 6 thing.Why don't you open the article and look at the slides for yourself?> I haven’t looked at the article but\s\s. . . and I stopped reading your comment.[removed]This post has been removed because your account is too new to post here.

Is this gonna be an actual scandal covered in the news at this point? I was kinda just hoping we could forget Trump ever existed and move tf on lol.[sure](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mark-meadows-trump-capitol-riot-powerpoint-b1973809.html)Elect Biden must have been the main topicBiden was a compromise to stop a demagogue. Nobody loves Biden but he isn't especially detestable either.Microsoft should join Facebook and Twitter in banning Trump because of misuse of PowerPoint. /sTrump should be banned from all platforms for stochastic terrorism. not /sSo basically an article about people on Twitter who have no clue how the law works. Ok.Did you know about the donations already?I'm no fan of Alex Jones but Twitter is a fucking sewer.Didn't he tell people not to go in the capital though?Good question for the investigation>Calls grow louder.\s\s\sActual calls are actually just more Twitter activity.\s\sNewsweek has fallen so far from when I subscribed back in the early 2000s.Yeah this is not journalism. This article *is* the call for his arrest. Media does the exact same trick as Trump: ""pEopLe arE saYinG"" exactly what they want people to say.It's kinda wild how we all (presumably) went through grade school English and were told not to use ""weasel words""  but it's perfectly acceptable in journalism and politics to say ""some people are saying X"".Its the same four people but they are extra angry and tweeting all about it.Who bought Newsweek? I recall its ownership changed in the past few years.Alex is fine he was very anti-storming the capitol. Leave this guy aloneDid he break the law? Then arrest him.\s\sDid he not break the law? Then leave him alone.\s\sMob rule should be left in the past if we implemented all the nonsense you can read on twitter civilization wouldn't last a week.Damn right. Investigate his assIt’s no secret Alex Jones was on the steps of the capital actively trying to block people and using his megaphone to tell people NOT to go in the Capitol.  More sad evidence of how far journalists’ trust has deservedly fallen.I think someone standing on the steps of the Capitol giving directions during the attack should be investigated. If he’s there while a crime is happening and he also says he helped plan it then he’s in a lot of troubleI’m no expert on American law but I think you need to do something illegal to be arrested.The standard here is ‘probable cause’oh yes calls for ""arrest"" of a person for doing something thats no where near actually illegal but goes against your political views. \s\sCommunists and Nazis sure have infected the Left and DemocratsStorming the Capitol is in fact *quite* illegalJust some Twitter people they are incorrigible.Do people still believe it was all anything more than a planned photo op? Wow.Money talks. $500k is half a million little voicesOh look “centrist” once again pretending there is a legitimate threat to arresting Alex Jones because some dumb people on Twitter are being loud. But if I post articles about right wing Twitter all of sudden it’s not okay to equate cons to white supremacist.Lol you think centrists give a shit about this guy’s freedom?

The falsified government documents used to appoint fake electors is starting to look like direct criminal action and by the day it's becoming more and more clear that Trump was coordinated with folks who took unlawful action. The next few months are going to be really rough for the MAGA crowd.Hopefully they can find enough to throw him in jail but I don't have high hopes.  Maybe they can imprison enough people essential to his next campaign to keep him from taking a real run at winning in 2024 because it doesnt look like Biden is going to be a strong incumbent.The denial in some of these posts is classic. The sloth like quality of their sentience is quite amusing.BananasIf trump was smart about this he would come out and say sure he drafted it and bow out of the running.  Then put DeSantis or a moderate republican as the candidate.  Trump could still use his influence  while keeping distance but I doubt he could pull of the distance part lol.\s\sThe Dems only hope is to run against trump so they can say ""at least we aren't him"" and do everything they did last time.  In other words nothing but attack trump.So no one knows who wrote it it wasn't signed by Trump and it was never released...\s\sHow do they not know who wrote an electronic document? This stinks of BS.[deleted]I agree. They just got access to stuff the other day and they claim they already found a smoking gun? So soon? I don't buy it. It's awfully convenient and unrealistically fast. Besides which the committee already got caught falsifying evidence and they even copped to it and apologized when they were called on it. So as far as I'm concerned nothing they say can be trusted.Not being signed by Trump doesn't mean he didn't order it. It was part of presidential records so it was written by someone in the executive cabinet.If it was written in the white house it is probably traceable to a particular deuce and login credentials\sAlso for them  to ask for it they had to know somehow that it lready existed...> So no one knows who wrote it\s\sThe journalist doesn't know who wrote it.\s\s&nbsp;\s\s*Perhaps* their source doesn't know who wrote it. Or maybe they know and won't tell because reporting it would interfere with the investigation.\s\s&nbsp;\s\sThis primary reporting /= ""no one knows"">It’s not clear who wrote either document.\s\sNot sure who wrote it and it was not signed. Trump worked with nut jobs he's guilty of that. But he didn't write this and didn't sign this. Tell me why this should be in my list of top 100 things to care about.Investigating anything that comes out of this administration is going to take a long time and cases of this magnitude involving wealthy and powerful people like Trump are always complex since they use other people and organizations to do the dirty work for them.  \s\sBut if this was in fact written at the White House by people employed by the federal administration and appointed by Trump I'd say it's tremendously significant and very concerning. We shouldn't try to make less of it just because it failed this time.Because the fact that it was even drafted and Trump even considered signing it at all is concerning. Something you should be wary of.Sydney powell (trumps lawyer) specifically said the voting machines were rigged and needed to be seized for evidence. She's being sued for this.\s\shttps://nyti.ms/3pl4eT9\s\sThis backs up the reports from the meeting where Sydney powell was to be named special counsel. The time line connects too.Read the fantasy novelIf it was never issued why should I read it? I wish this sub would stop playing partisan games and discuss actually policy for once.I think this is bs too.  Besides if he “ordered” this no one would have compliedThat's a serious crime no matter if others complied or not.  \s\s""It was just a prank"" is not a defense for a president.gotta say it would have made for some very dank memesNext week we’ll find out that Trump was seeking the Pentagon’s support to declare martial law and suspend the Constitution to stay on as President and the response from our conservative friends will range from “why are we still talking about Trump” to “well he didn’t succeed so what’s the problem?” because the Petagon said no.You missed the most obvious one which is that it will immediately be dismissed as 'liberal bias' if from basically anything other than FOX OANN NewsMax Daily Caller or Breitbart. I've seen this ""rule"" even applied to Reuters and AP quite a bit here lately too.\s\sOnly after a link is provided from one of those select few sources will most of them move on to the other options you have suggested. Many will just close the tab pretend it never happened and again claim 'liberal bias' if the same is ever pointed out to them again from any source that is not a right wing echo chamber.Can you imagine if anyone of importance had said yes to Trump instead of no?I imagine it all the time because the next person to try this shit might be smart. \s\sI read a book detailing every historical failure of liberal democracy in 2018. It really opened my eyes. Very few coups were external or military. Most were performed from the inside a person in power perverting institutions to maintain power. We got very very close to suffering that fate. But for a few brave indivuals acting on principle we'd be in a whole different world right now.This is the thing that is by far the most concerning and why the recent move by some state governments to simplify the process of overturning their own election results is just so deeply disturbing. The institutions held out THIS TIME but the response by state governments has been to actually make it easier to do what Trump wanted them to do! It's insanity!This is what I find so maddening. People want to laugh off ""Russia Russia Russia"" when it's clear that Trump and his people would take anything from anyone and they were stopped by longtime Washington bureaucrats. Nothing proves this more than him basically letting the Overstock CEO practically take one of the leadership roles of his ""election fraud"" team.Republicans are traitors. Anybody who supports Donald Trump is an enemy of everything the United States stands for and you are actively working to destroy liberty freedom and Democracy.The term is confederate.TLDR: Mr. Trump attempted to pressure DOJ into declaring the result as ""corrupt"". \s\s&#x200B;\s\sA possibly relevant law:\s\s18 U.S. Code § 610 - Coercion of political activity:\s\sIt shall be unlawful for any person to intimidate threaten command or coerce or attempt to intimidate threaten command or coerce any employee of the Federal Government as defined in section 7322(1) of title 5 United States Code to engage in or not to engage in any political activity including but not limited to voting or refusing to vote for any candidate or measure in any election making or refusing to make any political contribution or working or refusing to work on behalf of any candidate.

I understand flipping the election is a hard sell but the fact that they won't even do anything about the known issues and just dismiss it as ""it's not enough to overturn the election"" and then turn that into ""it's all a lie"" is not acceptable.I live in ga.  Everything with any evidence at all was investigated Nd found to be nothing.  If you don’t have anything with evidence. You don’t have actual issues that need addressed.  \sTrump’s lawyers are getting sanctioned by judges and their cases were thrown out by Trump appointed judges because they have no factual basis.Guess you don't like reading.More ""unnamed sources ""?It’s extremely suspicious why he didn’t provide the attorney general with this information if it’s valid for criminal investigations. \s\sAlso the Justice department did not pursue criminal investigations as far as we know which could mean they’ve believed it to be a hoax or not enough to support the accusationsThe Trump white house has been pretty notorious for trying cases in the press. ""Lock her Up"" ""They should be in jail"". If there's a criminal case there.... pursue it. You can instruct the AG to open criminal investigations the FBI director was his own appointee. \s\sthe fact has always been that these seem more scandalous in piece part and in the press than they ever could in a court and they use it to their advantage.Well they traditionally don’t notify the world of open investigations.

I know Democrats were mad at him last week for releasing unverified Clinton information but are we really at the point where we can't trust the ~~Department~~ Director of National Intelligence?\s\sEDIT: DNI correctionHere’s the key quote:\s\s> Let me be clear: the intelligence community doesn’t believe that because there is no intelligence that supports that. \s\sNote he said they don’t have evidence it is disinformation but he didn’t say it’s not.  The FBI just began investigating that question two days ago so it’s not surprising there isn’t any evidence yet.>John Ratcliffe \s\sHmmm. Well Trump had to withdraw his nomination at first according to Wiki.\s\s*President Donald Trump announced on July 28 2019 that he intended to nominate Ratcliffe to replace Dan Coats as Director of National Intelligence.\[7\]\[8\] Ratcliffe withdrew after Republican senators raised concerns about him former intelligence officials said he might politicize intelligence and media revealed Ratcliffe's embellishments regarding his prosecutorial experience in terrorism and immigration cases.*\s\sThen apparently after making some deals with Republican senators he nominated him again and got him through. There doesn't seem to be anything in his background to justify his appointment in the first place. Other than loyalty to Trump. So no I wouldn't trust him.Trump doesn't appoint people because of their experience and regard for the responsibility and duty of the position. He appoints them based on their loyalty. That is why those that don't agree with him get put on the back burner then discarded. Did we forget how Ratcliffe was put in position?\s\shttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/ratcliffe-will-not-be-nominated-intelligence-chief-job-trump-says-n1038806\s\s> ""I would lean towards the president's nominees and I'd rather not address that until I've actually had a chance to meet him and discuss his background and qualifications"" McConnell said then. It was in sharp contrast with his praise for Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats on Sunday — the day the president announced his selection of Ratcliffe with no prior notice to Coats according to sources familiar with the decision who then hastily released a resignation letter in a chain of events that further angered the former Republican senator’s allies in the Senate.\s\s> ...\s\s> The president’s initial selection of Ratcliffe had confirmed some Republicans’ long-held fear: that when the president eventually replaced Coats he would select someone with little management or intelligence experience.\s\shttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/intel-officials-worry-trump-s-pick-top-spy-will-politicize-n1035821\s\s> But statements like that from Ratcliffe rated one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress are causing disquiet among current and former intelligence officials who worry that as the nation's top spy Ratcliffe will politicize what is supposed to be one of the most nonpartisan jobs in Washington.It is probably good for both sides. Trying to frame this as a Russia plot and not as guiliani making shit up was a pretty bad miscalculation by the democrats. It would have been much easier to argue that Guiliani is not trustworthy and leave it at that.Ratcliffe was appointed by Trump and Trump has learned to only appoint loyalists. I would never trust anything a trump appointee says.\s\sHe also could be playing with words. If the emails are fake they aren't Hunter Biden's emails so ""Hunter Biden's emails"" aren't part of a Russian disinformation campaign.

Somehow his laptop gets dropped off at a repair shop to a guy who can't verify it was a Biden that dropped it off then forgets about it for three months the *Bidens* forget about it for all that time and *then* he finds some sketchy video then there's some unnamed ""intermediary"" then the FBI siezes in in Decemeber and then everyone sits on it either while they planned for an October Surprise (likely) or Guiliani was shopping it around to the highest bidder/least likely to ask questions.\s\sAll of that we need to believe *before* we should be discussing the veracity of anything on these machines. We're not even at grade-school level of chain of evidence here.\s\sFor all the people here who are jumping right to arguing about the contents of these emails I'd expect their conspiracy radars to be going off even more loudly.He drops it off at a repair shop in Delaware even though he lives in Los AngelesWhy did Fox News Pass on this story?A story so unverified fox and even NY Post’s own journalists are avoiding attaching their names to itLmao 2016 all over again. ThE eMaIlS!!!!So Trump wants to win off stolen emails again. Wish this guy would try to win on his own merits.At this point I don’t have any reasons I SHOULD vote for either candidate just plenty of reasons to vote against the otherI think the emails are real (at least some of them) and there’s no hard evidence that they’re not real so far. BUT it’s extremely sus Rudy won’t get them to anyone to verify. A daily caller interview with Rudy was so bizarre. The reporter asked him some simple questions about the meta data- which Rudy did not understand and he got super defensive. He said “can’t anyone say anything positive about this” or something to that effect lmao. I will try to find the link.\s\s*found it. Daily caller interview below. Give it a few minutes :) \s\s[link](https://youtu.be/TPfe17tlMEQ)I can smell the fresh astroturf in many of these comments.Oh shocker it’s all a shamThis is as good as any other theater I suppose for a centrist sub I'm hearing alot of partisanship.. how do some of you not see how organized the time line has been so far. It's all part of the show. Shoot the fucking bird already..Why has no one really addressed whether or not the emails are real?Yeah I’d also like to know if Fox News has done any reporting on the subject?Ha. I'm sure the enquirer would have run it or weekly world news if that's still a thing.BAT BOY LIVES!Giuliani told the Times he brought his documents to the Post because ""either nobody else would take it or if they took it they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.""\s\sIt sounds like he didn’t take it anywhere else because they would try to verify the information beforehand.The emails are real doesn’t mean you’ve gotta vote for trump but sticking your fingers in your eyes and pretending they’re fake is ridiculous. There was an interview with the Biden campaign and they said “no one is saying the emails are inauthentic”. Of course this is planned by Guiliani etc as October surprise but I’d expect a centrist subreddit too be able to take both sides corruption into account...Not really. What he’s saying is that the information wouldn’t have been released before the election if he took it to a left-leaning source.  That might not be true but it does make sense.ExactlyThe information was verified to a much higher degree than any of the ""Trump"" dirt.\s\sHe did that because 90% of the media is an extension of the DNC and desperate for Trump to lose.This close to the election? I'm not surprised....the MSM were all scared that they'd be crucified like what happened with Hillary.A lot of people are saying that this sub isn’t staying centrist as of late but I think that it just goes to show how:\s\sA: nobody is ever truly centrist on everything.\s\sB: there is so much utter crap going around that it’s difficult to maintain an unbiased view.On the other hand look how the media handled the Steele Dossier. They weren't shy about picking it up but somehow we should believe that this time their hesitancy is a sign of inauthenticity? That's illogical.\s\sThe veracity of the laptop contents is all that concerns me and the angles that the media are taking seem quite odd. ""The contents were hacked"" is not an argument against it's veracity. ""This is a Russian disinfo plot"" is not an argument against it's veracity. From what I've seen no one has taken the angle that the contents are provably inauthentic in fact some people connected to the contents have come forward and corroborated the contents.\s\sFrom what we can tell the info contained on the laptop is genuine though I would like to see more info on what exactly is there.This is all fishy as hell on both sides. But it doesn’t seem like the authenticity of the emails are being disputed. And it’s bizarre that nobody left-leaning questions the money paid to a man with a significant drug problem suddenly in the positions Hunter Biden ended up in while his dad was in the VP office. Circumstantial or not that’s fishy as hell and everybody is trying to pretend it’s normal.It’s nepotism. It’s normal with politics.\s\sJoe probably wanted to get his son a position so he can be independent and make his own money. \s\sTrump literally does this with his kids and inlawOh you Mean Giuliani had to go to a press outlet that isn't an extension of the DNC. Shocking.Did you read the article. It says No one else would print it without vetting the story. It also says the guy that wrote the article for the Post refused to put his name on it because there was no vetting.Pretty sure Fox News turned this thing down. \s\sTIL Fox News is an extension of the DNC 😂😂😂Or he had to go a news source that feeds into right wing garbage propagandaCampaign said Biden will be unavailable until Thursday. You know they’re hoping this news blows over. Hate to tell them that only 20% of the emails and pictures have been releasedThe fact that the entire thing Wasn’t released screams political ploy rather than wanting an investigation20% of the emails with no headers 20% of the pictures with no exif 20% of the data with no forensics to back up anything.What's interesting is that at the time of writing neither Biden nor anyone in his campaign has come out and said that it's fake.\s\sWhenever a reporter has asked Biden about this issue all he does is aggressively deflect and outright ignore the question. This is just like whenever someone asks him about court packing. You gotta wait AFTER the election to find out what he thinks of court packing.\s\sThe democrats are fascists that wants to kill off democracy\s\sIt should be a simple thing shouldn't it? Joe Biden can just come out and say that the information is false and blame it on big bad Putin and ""Russian disinformation"". The mainstream media will swallow it like cum\s\sAnd yet not only does the Biden campaign not come out and deny it they're even asking for the laptops backHe stated he doesn’t want to do court packingThis thread or ‘what happens when mainstream media censors a significant piece of news relating to a hotly contested election and now no one knows what to think because no one has told them what to think’....Does she not understand the concept of swing votes and how important they are? Maybe her district is overwhelmingly liberal. The rest of the country? Ehhh. There's a lot of people like me who want fiscal conservatism and social liberalism.The biggest group of swing voters in this country are those who swing from not voting to voting.Other away around as well aka Christian DemocratsShe’s right that even the party is too far split. \s\sHowever she thinks that the moderates just need to push far left but that seems to be where they lost the election because the party pushed too hard far left and alienated lots of the moderates. The extremists not the moderates threw the election and are likely going to throw 2020. \s\sMost people are pretty moderate left or right. People like AOC and Shapiro are the 1% of the political spectrum.She isn’t wrong centrist dems would be considered moderate right wingers in some countries.Moderates sure proved they understood the concept of swing voters when Hillary lost to a reality tv star.And yet most people are overwhelmingly supportive of liberal policies when they're laid out for them.\s\sShe is right. The center here is the right in most western democracies.Hmm. Maybe you should email her office and ask how she won her election? Or go on Netflix and watch the documentary about her you know...the won the shows how she beat a establishment incumbent who was in the seat for years. I'm sure she understands swing votes exist. But where they exist in large numbers is limited when you're talking about a national election. Also local districts are gerrymandered by both parties to benefit their power grab. Politicians basically pick their own voters. Courts have been ruling these efforts unconstitutional. Finally. So you're a centrist on fiscal conservatives social liberalism issues? Hmmm. So why doesn't she appeal to you? She is for many social liberalism type solutions from better regulatory oversight to providing access to reproductive rights. Also a comprehensive Medicare solution that would reduce household expenditures on healthcare.So stop complaining and go start your party lady.The irony it hurts!\s\sI'm actually glad she said this out loud. I'm a moderate Democrat that has been watching the far left try to take over our party for years. Unfortunately as soon as anyone points this out the left attacks you. \s\sI have been advocating that if they are so unhappy with the Democrat party and they believe their methods  (aggressive radical change) for achieving progressive ideology is the best approach hands down they should try to create their own party instead of sewing divisiveness within and often flat out campaigning against the Democrat party. That might cost the Dems an election cycle or 2 because frankly we need their votes too but I think they'll quickly discover that it's cold and miserable outside the ""big tent"" and they don't have nearly as much support as their passion (and the internet) is telling them they do.\s\sI will always believe that the President of the United States of America cannot be some far left or far right partisan AND be the President for ALL Americans. Or at least try to be. A President with no intent nor inclination to even consider more moderate views will just cause more divisiveness IMO. That opinion being based on simply observing the Trump Presidency.\s\s**But here's the thing. it's dead simple to show that she is deflecting here. Her ""tea party"" assertion is so laughably inaccurate it's almost Trump level gas-lighting.**\s\sObvious reason #1 - The Tea party is NOT the moderate wing of the Republican party. It's the far right wing just like the socialist wing is the far left.\s\sObvious reason #2 - The moderate wing is and has always been the majority voting block. That's why we've never produced a far left nominee for President. So to say that the moderates are the fringe group trying to take over the party is absurd.\s\sObvious reason #3 -  The only difference between the Tea Party and the Socialist movement is that the Tea Party succeeded. They created their own caucus (Freedom Caucus) with real power. Now they have their chaos President backing Tea Party candidates stacking the courts with conservative judges and loading up his cabinet with people who's interests are comically at odds with the offices they are appointed to (Betsy Devos Scott Pruitt Rex Tillerson Rick Perry).This is very well said.\s\sI am somewhat concerned that us millennials will end up taking the party in that direction but I think people often become more conservative (or at least moderate) with age so hopefully it won't happen.i have a strong opinion about what you said but i don't have enough knowledge to speak it otherwise i would equate aoc to just a liberal trump. with less bs and more manipualtionThe tea party of the left  that makes zero senseThe thing is I don’t think she is necessarily wrong about the discrepancy between classical liberals and progressives. But the democrats need to learn the first law of politics: LIE! But maybe times are a changing.She seems like the Trump of the left:\s\s* She advocates policies without first determining what the costs and benefits of the policy are\s* She says whatever is on her mind regardless of the potential impact\s* She bases her views on ideology not what is pragmatic\s* Some views (thinking total spending here) have a loose relationship with logic and common sense at best\s* She openly hates and attacks people who disagree with herWhen people claim to be centrists and equate the actions of this Representative to Trump they have zero credibility. You're talking about a President who actively promotes nationalism and employed more than one senior advisor with ties to white supremacists. You're not a centrist. If you were you'd ser she is somewhat correct. The party has such a huge tent that's it is going to have a problem pleasing everyone under it. Other countries have more alternative parties instead of a somewhat fictitious two party system that is showing its age.She's a populist like Trump is but I would argue that Trump is far worse. At least AOC acts like an adult when she's working.She's right about one thing: in any other country she and Biden would not share a party.But they might be part of a coalition government (more often than not probably) so she’d still need to learn to work with him and compromise (as would he).Yeah but thats not the sort of thing you want to say to build party unityAll I have to say is let her off. Then the Democrats as a whole won't be labelled as far left dumbasses and the common sense centrists can sweep up the votes.Oh I wish. It would be amazingAOC dipping a toe in a sea that ""centrists"" should OWN.She's really looking to separate that light of she's not a Democrat but a socialist. Democrats have knowingly and public abandoned figures before. Maybe we'll be done with this pdawan who thinks ""the government can just figure it all out"" like that's worked input favor.The problem is our system. WE NEED MORE PARTIES. Allow coalitions across party lines. Allow different interest groups to be honest with their goals. Our democracy is impressive and long lasting.   I don't particularly like AOC's policies or biden's. I'm a centrist because the two party system is absurd. We should listen to the wise words of the past the two party system divides us.Lol well she would share a party with friend of \[insert Islamist/communist/terrorist\] Jeremy Corbyn whereas I don't think that Biden would. Biden FTW.There way I see it there are three main wings of the Democrat party. The far left/progressives the old guard/establishment and the moderates. \s\sWe moderates seem to be either ignored completely or dismissed as Republicans with a Democrat face. Which is frustrating. Or we're totally mischaracterized to try and shoehorn us into someone's camp. I was told I should have voted for Hillary in 2016 and I should vote for Warren in 2020 because they're ""moderates""... Obviously. If that's what everyone thinks a moderate looks like then I miss being outright ignored.Yeah it seems fairly clear to me that the progressive dems don't want the moderates in the party. Seems like a stupid move long-term...I'd they keep doing this as soon as there's a moderate republican well jump shipShe's gonna cost Bernie the election at this point.Damn. Like the Democratic party did to Bernie last year right? A move the put the beloved well admired and energetic Hillary Clinton.She’s clearly in a bubble. Come to the South and she wouldn’t even qualify for Democratic candidate in any state or local election. \s\sHate how black and white that view is.[deleted]I think what you're saying is there are 3 factions in the Democratic party? I see 2 what do you see the 3rd as?She's a right about how she wouldn't share a party in another country tho. Since only two parties have a chance in elections in the US the variety within one party is unlike what you would see in other countries. In an average European country Biden would probably be in a centrist party while she would be in an entirely socialist one. If there was more party variation in the US all the radicals would probably leave the current parties to form their own far-right or far-left ones.I don't know what to think anymore.  My state (PA) has left the decision up to school districts and administrators.   I personally am fine with that but there's been a backlash on both sides here.\s\sI'm also personally skeptical on how effective a surgical mask on 10 year olds really is.  At that age I was probably lucky to have both of my shoes tied and my fly up all the same time  - let alone keeping a mask properly worn.Not to mention children who may struggle as it is with sensory integration disorders. Good luck trying to force masks on those children all day.Yup. \s\sI have a friend from med school who works in Miami and he says it's a mess down there. Hospitals are full and they're cancelling elective surgeries rerouting resources and surgical floor rooms to handle COVID patients.\s\sI practice in Minnesota and we've seen a minor uptick but we're handling fine. The only big change is the university I work at is requiring masks in public/non-hospital buildings now which they weren't earlier this summer.I got 2 friends doing residency at the children's hospital here in Arkansas it's not a good place right now. At the beginning of the pandemic people were celebrating health care workers as heros and although I appreciated them then it wasn't until now that I've gone that far in my thinking. It's like being in a war zone struggling to keep people alive.Why is this so downvoted? I thought it would be interesting to spur a discussion amongst centrists on this issue and see where we fall.> Why is this so downvoted? I thought it would be interesting to spur a discussion amongst centrists on this issue and see where we fall.\s\sReddit just shut down NNN which was a haven for qanon pro-Trump/anti-vaxx/anti-democracy trolls. Brace yourself for the same kind of wave to /r/centrist that happened with parler/voat were shut down.It is. You know whyI didn't downvote but the headline that the AP writer chose might be a reason why.  Cases are spiking in all states not just ""red"" ones.  \s\sNormally that type of bias doesn't make it's way past AP or Rueters editors.I just feel bad for the kids and people who want to get vaccinated but can’t.Could someone please explain to me why a state would \*ban\* mask mandates? I thought masks were an easy way to reduce the spread of the pandemic. The question thus ought to be why they don't mandate masks for everyone indoors with strangers and outdoors in close quarters. \s\sI can't get my head around banning masks like this. What is the rational here? Do they want to keep the pandemic going and do they love lockdowns?The real reason? The science isn't conclusive.\s\sMasks that work are N95 and similar type masks. Read damn near any research paper about it on Google scholar or otherwise and you can come up with several confounding variables in the tests they run (refuting their conclusions). Though many papers aren't even actual experiments on top of this. They'll run simulations with variable numbers for infectiousness among others and cite the results as evidence for cloth masks.\s\sIf you want to wear one because it makes you feel better then fine. If you want to *force* others to wear one because it makes you feel better you're crossing a line.\s\sIts well past time we talked about the garbage science behind masking. Long and the short of it is knowing the difference between droplets and an aerosol (and consequently which is more infectious) knowing how long microbes can remain airborne (it can be a very long time) and realizing that gaps exist in virtually all cloth masks. Combine this with general bad masking behaviors (touching masks wearing dirty masks or not covering your mouth because you are wearing a mask) and you possibly end up with more bad than good.\s\sI'm not gonna do all the legwork getting all the papers and everything but I'll compile it a bit to get the point across.\s\s1. Covid remains aerosolozed in the air for up to three hours or more. Droplets settle within seconds or minutes (note: aerosols are the component you should worry about when considering infectiousness). Aerosols are considered infectious particles <5um in size.\s2. Masks have gaps. They do not do a particularly good job of filtering particles especially aerosols. This is the part there isn't a scientific consensus on. There aren't very many good studies out. So far we know that surgical masks help (to what degree is still debated) cloth masks aren't very good and properly fit respirators are very useful in preventing infection\s3. Bad masking behaviors combined with the idea that masks are keeping you safer than you actually are may actually enhance spread. Imagine wearing a bulletproof vest to a firefight thinking you're safe pushing out into the battle and then getting shot in the head. This is similar to people who think they're safe wearing a mask to a concert or other public event only to find out they caught covid days later. If you don't want to catch covid the best practice is to stay away from densely populated places.\s\sIn conclusion: it should be up to the individual if they want to wear a mask at this point. If this were a more severe illness the discussion might be different. Vaccines are available widely and life should be returning to normal. Case rates will rise and fall with the tides but as long as people are recovering things will be okay. If you don't want to catch covid a cloth mask will not be very helpful in mitigating exposure if you still visit densely populated areas. Nobody wants more lockdowns but most people are beginning to move past covid and that means moving past masks.I could explain to you that there is a difference between a mask mandate and giving people a choice but you either don't agree with that or don't understand. As they say ""If you have to ask....""\s\sI don't have a problem with masks per se but wearing a flimsy piece of cloth over your face is a poor fucking excuse for a mask and won't do much to slow the spread. \s\s“We know today that many of the facecloth coverings that people wear are not very effective in reducing any of the virus movement in or out — either you’re breathing out or you’re breathing in” he told CNN’s John King.\s\s“We need to talk about better masking” he continued. “We need to talk about N95 respirators which would do a lot for both people who are not yet vaccinated or not previously infected — protecting them as well as keeping others who might become infected having been vaccinated from breathing out the virus.  \s  \sOsterholm’s comments come after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week reissued new masking guidance even for vaccinated people that included low-risk children returning to in-person classes this fall as schools reopen.  \s  \sMost medical professionals have long known that surgical and cloth masks have little effect on stopping the spread of viruses much less COVID-19 and that N95 masks are the preferred piece of protecting equipment to stop the viral spread. But they also acknowledge N95 masks are inherently unsuitable for long-term use.""Not banning masks but the mandates. There's a distinction between the two. They don't want to force anyone into wearing them if they feel like they don't have or want to.  They are still allowing the option to wear them if you feel like you're safer with one on but they aren't letting anyone force the issue on anyone. It could complicate the message about vaccine effectiveness if they mandate something the vaccine was advertised to allow the removal of because you were safe after. You're allowed to wear one but not to force anyone else to.I wore my mask diligently and I got my jabs as soon as they were available. Masks mitigate the spread of COVID but they are not ending the pandemic unless all preventative measures are taken. People do not wash their hands properly. People do not socially distance. People do not wear clean properly fitting masks. People touch the parts of their mask where they breathe. The most truthful thing Fauci said was when he said that masks do not provide the protection that people think they do. \s\sHalf measures have gotten us to where we are today.  We need to encourage more people to get vaccinated but more importantly to get healthy. We can't control the old part but we can control the fat part.Correct. I went to the gym for the last 4 months. The sauna window over sees six public sinks and beyond that the side walls to urinals and stalls. The amount of people who refuse to wash their hands at the fucking gym is vast. Next to it is a steam room and a little hack is if you spray cold\sWater on the temperature regular it pours out steam as it thinks it’s colder. One gentleman decided instead of using the squirt bottle for it he would just simply spit the water on it. It’s located near the roof of the room and he inevitably spit on 3 people I wasn’t one of them but I was equally as mad. I spoke up first saying “wow you’ve fucking learned nothing in the past year” the other three guys wanted to fight him. He was proud of what he did and called me “a pussy”. I left the room as the other three guys cursed at him. \s\sTL:DR - people are selfish gross stupid beings.It's probably worth it to get legit N95 masks at this point there's a company in Ft. Worth that makes N95 masks.Hospitals are full. Maybe we should try to do something?Absolutely! [Far more white folks have been vaccinated than any other ethnicity. Perhaps the focus should be on improving outreach and messaging for all the other ethnicities that have fallen woefully behind the pack.](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographic) Looking at the charts messaging needs to be improved for many age groups as well.Cases may be up but deaths are way down. The virus is becoming weaker because it’s mutating to survive. It’s how these things work. \s\sCases could mean anything. Plenty of people have mild symptoms. It’s roughly 95% of positive tests are either mild or no symptoms at all.While deaths are down they're definitely *way down* as you put it. They're only slightly under where we were this time last year mostly due to vaccines. But the death rate keeps climbing. My source? NYT Covid Tracker and John Hopkins DashboardPanic porn sells.Actually the only place I’ve seen arguing Delta is less deadly is the nypost and I have a hard time trusting them. \s\sHere’s one from UV Davis saying [Symptoms are the same but cases are skewing younger](https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/newsroom/8-things-health-experts-want-you-to-know-about-the-delta-variant/2021/07). So if the symptoms are the same we should likely see the same results. \s\sThe argument that it’s in-and-of-itself less deadly likely falls apart when you realize the countries that were hit hard by delta and had good outcomes were also fairly heavily vaccinated. Meaning vaccines saved lives not that they would have been fine getting delta if they hadn’t been vaccinated. Another possibility is that younger people heal more quickly but that doesn’t mean we want all of our 25-45 year olds to have permanent lung and kidney damage either. \s\sYour comment reads just like the nypost article I saw and it’s actually very wrong and misleading. It’s a good thing for a virus to become more contagious and less deadly but certainly not required; and the two - how contagious and how deadly - are not linked in any way. A virus can be super contagious and still super deadly; or hard to catch and not ever kill the host. But evolution doesn’t force one to decline if the other rate is increased.>Cases may be up but deaths are way down. The virus is becoming weaker because it’s mutating to survive. It’s how these things work.\s\sBullshit. Deaths and hospitalizations are up from where they were in June. Also the delta variants isn't weaker it's stronger hence younger people winding up in the hospitals unlike with previous strains.""virus is weaker""\s\smeanwhile Delta variant is 1000 times stronger. The death is down because ehem vaccination. \s\sYou have a superficial understanding of biology much less the purpose of prevention.What's the mortality rate OP?Death counts aren't the only metric you should care about. Hospitals are packed in many states. Medical workers are once again stretched thin. \s\s\s\sIf you are in a bad car accident there's no guarantee they'll be able to get you the care you need in time. If you've been waiting on a life changing knee or hip replacement then your surgery probably just got cancelled until further notice. \s\s\s\sThe strain on the hospital system has always been a focal point of curbing the spread as much as we can yet some governors (and yourself) ignore that fact.I'm so sick of people only caring how many people die. There's so much than that. Hospitals are full. Texas is going to stop elective surgeries. Just being extremely sick for a couple of weeks like so many people have been is bad enough. I didn't even mention the long term damage to heart and lungs.“The house fire didn’t kill anyone so we won’t count it as one of the bad things that happened in our life”> What's the mortality rate OP?\s\sYou know 10 seconds of searching would show that /u/andysay 's article is accurate: \s\s> [Unvaccinated people are much more likely to become infected and get severe disease or die. Furthermore low vaccination rates favor the spread of the virus posing a health risk for all the individuals within the community including those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/unvaccinated-people-are-more-likely-to-die-of-covid-19-because-they-are-more-vulnerable-to-infection-and-severe-disease-tomi-lahren/)\s\sAnd since the CDC doesn't track death rates of the unvaccinated vs vaccinated the mortality rate includes those who are vaccinated who are the vast minority of those who die when exposed to COVID.This goes beyond mortality rate hospitals are strained now. The mortality rate will skyrocket if people can't get any care while they're seriously sick. \s\sThe only saving grace is that we have vaccines. Which everyone should be getting unless they're under 16 or they can't get it for a medical reason.What's your IQ?Why can no politician say both 1) we will not mandate masks you’re not children. But also 2) this virus is real serious and please get vaccinated.\s\sI want to agree with some of the laws you’ve done DeSantis but you’re doing it all for the wrong reasons.This is what the governors in Arkansas and Alabama are pretty much saying. Hutchinson and Ivey[removed]Please be kindStarter comment...\s\sOn one hand I can't endorse the thinly-veiled suggestion of bribery that is revealed by his ""Roy is retiring"" comment and it's concerning that these types of tactics are so prevalent in Washington. I wish that weren't the case. That said I think a lot of people are misinterpreting what Joe Manchin is actually doing right now.\s\sManchin is trying to prove that the Senate is still capable of bipartisanship and trying to form a coalition of moderates. The tactics might be slimy but we'd all be better off if the two parties could produce some compromise on infrastructure voting rights climate legislation immigration reform the Jan 6th commission criminal justice reform etc. Otherwise we'll get a progressive wish list on a couple of big spending bills with no GOP support via reconciliation and nothing at all on any other issue due to GOP obstruction.\s\sFor all the criticism Joe Manchin is taking from his own party right now I'd argue we need him to do exactly what he's doing. He's not just sending a message to progressives that they need to moderate their positions. He's also telling the GOP that they had better cooperate on at least a few high-profile bills or he will no longer be able to champion the notion of bipartisanship and preserve the filibuster.\s\sWe need someone to be leading that fight and Manchin just happens to be the guy because he's a moderate democrat from a conservative state.  We need him to succeed.Manchin takes blame so the other moderates don’t need to. \s\sManchin is what every Democrat besides progressives would like to do but it’s politically easier to let him take the flak. \s\sHe was always set up to be the scapegoat for this situation. \s\sBig tent politics what a mess.>Manchin is trying to prove that the Senate is still capable of bipartisanship and trying to form a coalition of moderates. \s\sHaha. So naive. Joe Manchin is trying to please his billionaire donors so they keep stuffing his pockets with gold. Nothing more nothing less.> He's also telling the GOP that they had better cooperate on at least a few high-profile bills or he will no longer be able to champion the notion of bipartisanship and preserve the filibuster.\s\sI am not sure about that. Isn't the window on new legislation closing pretty fast? When are the next elections? You may remember that a lot of states have passed laws to suppress Democratic votes trying to ensure a Republican House majority.There you go. Billionaire donors are paying Joe Manchin to block the filibuster reform because they know Democrat legislation will hurt their profits.Seriously? A lot of Democratic legislation actually helps corporate profits. Amazon and Apple support increasing the minimum wage so smaller businesses can't afford to pay and they are the ones left standing.Manchin is a corporate puppet. He is voting in ways that directly contradict the interests and will of his voters to please wealthy interests. That is what it means to be ""moderate"" in the Senate- putting business interests first.He is single handedly saving this nation from a leftist take-over.Shows he's still a partisan liberal at heart wanting to resort to fucked up methods like bribery in order to allow the federal government to usurp the power of redistricting from the states. I hope all the leftists raging about how corrupt and moderate he is understand deep down that he's *not* a moderate just a leftist in sheep's clothingI love the description “conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans.”  Very telling.I love leaked audio.\s\sAnd I can find a way to see something noble about what Manchin is doing here. Like yes influence brokering exists and we somehow can't make it illegal even though it's awful and so we have to play the game and It kind of looks like he is trying to foster bipartisanship.\s\sBut I don't think that the way he wants it to look is true. See since the Republican party has no tactic other than to cut government and oppose reform bribing slightly moderate Republicans to feign a sense of bipartisanship on a vote where there is no chance the GOP will actually let anything get past the filibuster well that isn't actually helping centrism. It is just lying about the state of bipartisanship and kicking the can down the road. \s\sI am increasingly coming to the conclusion that the only way for the country to thrive long-term and deal with problems without a minority party selling its soul to the highest bidder to block progress is to somehow persuade the public to pass constitutional amendments to change how we appoint legislators.\s\sBecause right now there are policies being debated in Congress that 60 or 70% of the public is at least kind of on board with. You would think that there would be some movement from Republicans to say sure raise taxes on the rich because they're doing fine and the middle class and poorer are not doing fine. Or yes investigate the attack on the capital with an eye to making sure that extremism doesn't endanger democracy. But the GOP as an institution will not allow that.\s\sAnd as long as we have a two-party system that has geographically locked representatives we're going to be stuck in this. It's unhealthy. And while the senator here seems like maybe he's trying to build an on-ramp for some Republicans to cooperate we've been at this for what 26 years since Newt Gingrich?\s\sThe Republican Party is not built to reward politicians who cooperate with Democrats. I think Manchin here looks very naive.[deleted]This screams: ""I worked really hard to find an asshole who isn't relevant in any way shape or form today. But look how terrible he is!""\s\sIm at a loss for why anyone should care.While entirely possible these laws are just being made to allow mowing down opposition I will be addressing them with the benefit of the doubt.\s\sThere is a self-defense grey area with these incidents - run them over too soon and you aren't covered too late and you are dead.\s\sAnd it is a problem these mobs are nuts and they will be trying to kill you.

And that is a reasonable worry. But at the end of the day I have to side with anything that keeps me and my family safe - these laws do.I try and look at laws like this from a long-term perspective. Do you think more drivers will start taking it upon themselves to crash into some protesters because of it?>But at the end of the day I have to side with anything that keeps me and my family safe - these laws do.\s\sThis is how you get authoritarianism. \sLiberty > SafetyI don’t know of any instance where a driver been killed by protesters?The additions to this bill deserve plenty of criticism but the source you posted is nothing more than heavily biased clickbait.It’s New Republic. They’ve been around since you daddy was in diapersBefore everyone jumps to the idea that this allows people to mow down people on the street with no repraucusions this bill is only effecting Civil Law not Criminal Law. This means if you are a driver who is being assaulted by people blocking a road and trying to break into your car if you drive through them they cannot sue you. However you can be charged with a crime by the county/state legal system. This law does not stop people from being arrested for committing motor-related crimes but stops violent rioters for suing drivers who may have injured them while engaging in dangerous behavior already.\s\sI still do think there can be some worrying factors about this law but I'd like to see it in more practical use before making judgement on how it is carried out.And if you're charged criminally you may still have exposure to a civil suit I'm guessing[deleted]Yeah fuck the 1st Amendment.~~Legalized terrorism~~The right to protect yourself and your property from rioters impeding your freedom of movement and who are trying to harm you. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. It really is just darwinism at it's finest. Anyone with half a brain knows it's not smart to stand in the street.How is driving your car into protestors on the street “protecting your property”? If you want to protect your car don’t hit people with itI may have to drive down there just to plow down some Abortion protestors.  It may start a whole tourism industry there!\s\sObviously /sReminder these laws apply to protesters blocking roads and mobbing you. You will not be covered if you start driving through parks to kill people.I'm not against people protesting in the street. Can't really agree on this> Earlier this week Florida Republicans enacted a law they claimed would prevent riots in the state. Its real purpose of course was to discourage protesting and punish demonstrators. One of the bill’s provisions has received a fair amount of national attention as it seems to give Floridians permission to attack protesters with their cars.>One of the bill’s provisions has received a fair amount of national attention as it seems to give Floridians permission to attack protesters with their cars.\s\sThat is not what this Bill does. This Bill does not give drivers who attack protestors criminal immunity but does protect them from certain Civil Lawsuits. If you are a driver being attacked by rioters trying to break into your car or disrupt traffic you cannot be sued by those rioters if you injur them in the process of trying to get away from them. You can still be charged with a crime by the county or state if you do this.All the good points have already been said so I'm just going to give a shout out to a source like the New Republic and an article in ""The Soapbox"" section lol.>sorted by: controversial (suggested)"

That's one of the causes he fought for.\s\sFor example the case law you would need to defend yourself in court isn't available free and online. \s\sThat effectively means we are ruled by laws we aren't allowed to read without paying a fee.That's a good one.  State of California makes their case law available on line http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/ this needs to be a requirement for the federal government as well.  I should be absolutely mandatory that any law that we are governed by is available for free on-line and also via  a form that allows people without internet access to be able to easily access and understand the laws that govern.I agree.  And along with that since our government is continually moving toward administrative law and rapidly expanding the use of criminal law we should have free online law schools or at least the lectures and literature available online so that one can take the bar exam.  The current protectionist attitude our government has toward attorneys and law schools is reprehensible.  Huh what sort of fee are you talking here?

I agree with removing it from money and not putting it on monuments going forward but I absolutely don't agree with removing it from existing monuments. Asside from the insane cost of doing so it would be revising history denying that we behaved in a manner which we did. Reminds me of schools censoring Huck Finn. As much as I hate our current national motto I couldn't vote yes to remove it from existing monuments. [deleted]Exactly this.  If it's already on historic monuments and such we have no right to remove it from history.  Going fourth though it should be reconsidered. This is an opinion I can actually agree with. Anything else is crazy. I wouldn't worry about it too much though they aren't going to let you vote about it anyway.What if it were added to those monuments years after it was built? Or if it included a quote out of context deliberately intended to make someone seem religious when they weren't? The Jefferson Memorial for example includes a quote that makes him seem Christian.Agreed. You had me at revising Huck Finn. Leave literature alone. It was the language of the time. Not to mention the fact that it would be an enormous waste of money. With money for instance you just have to wait until the next printing and remove the words from that edition. Most of the rest are absolutely absurd wastes of money.Well if the under god was added after the monument was built it should be removed. Its not revisionist its restoration. There was a time that people placed ‘whites only’ signs on drinking fountains and bathrooms. Its was a cultural thing with a lot of racist traditions behind it.   Was removing the signs that excluded the minorities/ and made them feel like less of an american a revision of history or a denying of what we did when it was done?  I agree we shouldn't put any money towards removing the current building signs if they are original but I'm just not understanding the removing signs is denying our behavior thing. I may be wrong but I currently can't think of any other situation where we removed something that was exclusionary in some bad way and doing so somehow denied that we excluded people unjustly to begin with.You can specify your own qualified answer rather than picking yes or no (e.g. ""Yes to currency but please do not revise history by altering monuments"").\s\sAlso FYI to respond look for the blue ""Answer This"" button toward the top-right of the page.Would be like re-naming the Washington Redskins (which in all honesty they probably should but I'm interested how it will play out)I'm actually sure that the question was improperly worded. I think it meant ""new"" currency federal buildings national monuments and other aspects of government. I seriously doubt they were going to send people to strip monuments of God. I didn't even think of that when I read the question.\s\sThough it does say remove. I think they might have meant cease to use. Agreed couldn't have said it better myself.*Aside fromI agree with this. Speaking not as a US citizen I just see this is the most sensible answer.We just added a stance for ""only remove future references""There are two us mottos. One is the ceremonial one to which you're referring. The other is e plurabus(spelling?) Unum. Such basically means one out if many. That one is cool put if on money.I came here to post exactly what you did. Yeah what he said!Atheists don't wish to destroy cover up or rewrite history. But we don't wish to repeat it.[deleted]%100 on-pointI personally like the original national motto better anyway.  E pluribus unumDoes anyone know what the eye over the pyramid is?yeah but you know what they mean and you know what those voting NO mean.  Voting yes doesn't mean the government is going to start spending trillions of dollars to erase it from monuments.  You're just being a pain in the ass. I disagree even though I will most certainly be downvoted to oblivion:\s\sThey removed the swastika (that's the Nazi symbol the Hakenkreuz) from all stuff in Germany because it is associated with crime against mankind. You will not find a publicly displayed Hakenkreuz in Germany. All that ARE displayed IRL are either in a museum or illegal.\s\sThey should remove all occurences of god in the same way IRL because all and every organized believe in a god is a crime against mankind much the same way Nazi ideology was in WWII.\s\sThey can make photos of it for archival purposes but god has to be removed from PUBLIC.[deleted]History should also show that people corrected their errors. You're saying millions of future visitors should keep seeing the ""god"" stuff 100 years from now even though by then no one will believe in that BS.\s\sThe cost of repair is irrelevant. I'd rather remove money from politics first then we can worry about what the money looks like.Annnnnd that will happen never.  I have been discussing the reality of money and how the United States will never get out of debt till we reform our entire monetary system with friends and family. People are afraid of change but it NEEDS to happen. The people need to control government not money and businesses who only think about themselves. That's a lovely idea but it will never happen. Power attracts money and money attracts power. It would take a violent and radical revolution the likes of which humanity has never seen in order to change this. This is the way governments have operated since the dawn of civilization. It is not an American problem it is a human one.Remove money from politics?  Politics is whose hand is in whose wallet.I like E Pluribus Unum.  It's not about whether people want it. It's about whether it's Constitutional or not. It's not. Removing from currency is NOT THE SAME THING as removing from national monuments. ""God"" was ADDED TO THE CURRENCY FOR NO DAMN REASON IN THE 50s.\s\sSorry for caps I just can't believe the short memory Americans can have about their own short history.It's been on coins since 1864""No damn reason""? I beg to differ. The movement was started by the Knights of Columbus and a handful of members of Congress to thumb our noses at those ""godless commies"". I object to it because despite claims that it just ""reflects our national heritage"" it was in fact added specifically as an affront to atheists. We had a reason it was to set us apart from goddess Communism. Not ssaying it was a GOOD reason but it was a reason.  TheNoize do you think it should also be removed from the pledge of allegiance? Just want to hear your thoughts.Serious question here: Why does it matter if it's on our money? I honestly forget it's even there until someone brings it up.At first I thought that the site knew my location but I realized I just happen to live in the city and state that come first alphabetically. \s\sI think we should stop putting references to religion on federal buildings and currency moving forward but it seems like overkill to remove what's already there. I'd be interested to see the responses to the question of what to do from now on. Seeing it etched in our monuments doesn't even come close to making kids say the pledge of allegiance in schools or learn ""intelligent design"" or whatever. No it knew my state and im near the bottom. I think it guesses from your IP.Remember that time an online petition actually made a difference? This isn't a petition. It's a poll. Operation Rainfall was a complete success.I don't think that this petition will actually result in references to god being removed from stuff but it might succeed in helping people to see that there is a significant minority that feels that way.  \s\sOne of the biggest problems with atheism is that most people assume there are less of us than there are.  [deleted]Dark Souls PC port?Here's my EXTREMELY VALUABLE input I know you've all been waiting with bated breath:\s\sI'm not religious I don't have anything against religion itself or the people that follow their religion of choice (Assuming they're open minded and don't judge every living creature they encounter ha ha right?). I've had my fair share of experiences with several different religions as I was growing up my parents were very open minded and allowed me to experience all sorts of different religions on my own. I learned very quickly that it just wasn't for me. I would probably consider myself Agnostic or simply Spiritual more than anything else.\sAs far as our government goes; Buildings Currency Monuments etc. My opinion is there needs to be an absolute separation of Church and State on all fronts plain and simple. We as a society (And especially as Redditors) have already seen how chaotic and crazy a religious influence can make even the SIMPLEST OF DECISIONS in our government. For fuck's sake they can't even wipe their asses without referencing some portion of the Bible that states exactly how many wipes is too many not enough and whether you can do it yourself or with someone of the same sex in the same room.\sOur politicians can barely act on what is best for the people of this country without involving some flawed concept of Christianity or Catholicism. They can't vote on a simple idea without bringing in the Bible the Jesus dude or the big guy God himself. We can't even vote on a simple law to allow marriage to people who love one another what the fuck is that all about kids?\sAnyway my point in all this rant is simply that the longer we allow ANY religious references in any of our government activities the longer we're going to be fighting this religious battle in a government that should not have any religious affiliations whatsoever. If you as an individual would like to think that God has his eye on us and is giving us the strength and the power to be a great nation... that's fine by me do your thing. But DO NOT INTERFERE with what is best for the nation best for the people best for the majority just because the Bible says it's naughty or ill-advised. 90% of what's IN YOUR BIBLE is terrible evil insane outdated nonsense that offends even the religious followers who've failed to do their homework (i.e. Reading the fucking book that came with your choice of religion). The quicker we abolish these references the quicker we can start to become a nation that focuses on the good of the people. All of the people. Bam there it is. Chicks n' Midgets!!!\s\sTL;DR - I'm completely for abolishing any/all religious references within our local state and federal governments because stuff.I never closely look at my money. It could have a picture of giant cock and It'd have the same impact. Nothing. Doesn't matter. It's not about the money. It's about sending a message. I don't care if they change the money I just want more of it.  Please.[deleted]  \s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2467 \s > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/49246)Now think about how we feel where money is used in our name and has a claim to god on it.Your god is associated with a lot of bad things as well. What's one more? Simple solution: don't put it on any new money minted or any new monuments.\s\sThe old monuments are history the money will eventually attrite out. Put the actual national motto on it: ""E Pluribus Unum"".\s\sLet's not make a huge thing out of this. There is no for or against. The United States was formed and founded on the bases of church and state being separate. So it shouldn't be on currency. As a devout atheist I honestly couldn't care less. There are much more pressing matters at hand (notably the ongoing attempts by the Religious Right to integrate church and state). Removing ""In God We Trust"" from our currency is pretty low on the priority list.\s\sAs for the monuments those are historic and should be left alone. Altering history like that brings us a little closer to George Orwell's ""1984"" than I'd like.I don't really care that the words are there but I do care how people project those words to make it seem that america is a christian nation and whatever garbage they can come up with - how they use it for their own agenda. That's exactly why the words are there to create the impression that the US is a Christian nation as opposed to the ""atheist Communists"" that the ignorati got all worked up about in the '50s.I'm for it but also don't really care.  Having a coin or bill in my wallet that says In God We Trust doesn't matter as much as having it on federal buildings.  To remove it would be a waste to not put it on stuff in the future would be better.  I am against. I think we should ADD more fictional characters to these places. Seriously hear me out. US money is lame how much cooler would it be if we added quotes and pictures from some of Americas most bad ass action stars! National monuments of super heroes. The possibilities are endless :) I love this:\s\s> No as long as there are no references to specific religions a clear separation of church and state exists\s\sExcept if you're a polytheist.  So if you believe in zero gods or many gods well then you can go fuck yourself.. Because real Americans believe in exactly ONE god.\s\sSo I assume the same people would be ok with currency that said ""In Gods we trust?""Polytheist may believe there are many gods....but they don't trust any of them.Perhaps each note should specify a particular god.  So some would say in Allah we trust some would say in Buddha we trust and so on.  Then when people see all of these different gods on their money most of which they have never believed in it may occur to them just how ludicrous the whole idea of gods is.\sWell if kids can't celebrate Halloween at school because a few religious types think it's a heathen holiday then why should everyone else have to deal with religious crap everywhere we go or on the money we spend?\s Why do you guys care so much what your money says?\s\sMy money has people playing hockey and I don't like hockey. Should it be removed? No because the majority of Canadians like hockey and it's ingrained in our culture. Who gives a fuck? I think we have more important things to focus on as a country. Whether or not a quarter says ""in god we trust"" is not very high on my shit-that-really-affects-me list. I think we should put ""The Night is Dark and Full of Terrors"" on our currency.If god was on America's side then bush and cheney would have both dropped dead on September 12th 2001...I'm either in the ""who gives a flying fuck"" or ""why aren't we talking about more important issues"" camp.It's weird how the only major demographic difference is the party - with the Democrats being 50:50 split on the issue; Republicans 99:1 against removing the references.\s\sEducation income: no big difference from the average.This is a clear and easy way to see the differences between these two parties.In the grand scheme of things in the universe I think we're slowly growing up as a species and letting go of imaginary friends.Well I am an atheist so I don't see the 'need' for it to be on any of these items and would have no problem with not issuing any future reference to god on updates to coin and currency or reference to god on any new government buildings. But I don't want to waste taxpayers dollars for something I don't agree with just to hide it from my vision. The word is not causing any physical harm and if your 'offended' get over yourself already. The cost to destroy the currency and coin and work to remove the word from buildings would be outrageous. If I am 'enlightened' enough to see through the concept of religion then I should have the common sense to see the cost of removing a word is rather petty when there is so much genuine human need that money would serve better Sure why not? Just phase it out. This is on my list of things that don't really matter that much.We should just change the word god to mom there wayyy betterI vote for the replacement:\s\s*""To delusions we fall prey.""*I am for it. I would are the that even the vehemently religious don't ""trust in god"". If they actually did they wouldn't be so vocally opposed to the things that conflict with their world view. They would instead ""trust god"" to handle things in his own mysterious ways.    See though you're using logic which is a concept they don't seem to be capable of grasping.Well luckily theres credit cards... Silly AmericansThe sole purpose of the ""In god we trust"" is purely historical there is no reason why the dollar should bear that according to the first amendment there is a freedom of religion and thus the dollar shouldn't be bias toward any.... UNLESS the dollar is a Currency that is issued by a privately governed bank that issues currency on the ""believe"" of the US economy.\s\sI would be more worried about the fact that the us dollar isnt backed by gold anymore (1934) rather by a trust in something.... I ONLY TRUST IN GOLD....But the dollar is in such bad shape faith is the only thing that helps it keep its value. My take: whatever costs the least!  We don't have to rename streets named after Greek gods do we?  Sure if it costs nothing let's remove references from present and future minting.  But our buildings and monuments mark the ideas and ideals in our history like them or not and it's valuable to remember this.  Why spend money to remove them?  What a waste.trust in allah but tie your camel.I checked in about two hours ago and the numbers actually went down. This is rigged. I wonder if the 9% who answered ""No as long as there are no references to specific religions a clear separation of church and state exists"" would feel the same way if the motto read ""In Gods We Trust.""I think we have more pressing issues to worry about. Wars unemployment massive debt a burgeoning police-surveillance state a crumbling infrastructure etc. Please tell the number of problems I am allowed to worry about. I do not want to go over my limit.This must have been making the rounds on Christian blogs with such a current vote.We have bigger fish to fry.....thank you!!Legalize it!!![deleted]^^^\sThis man.... Hand him a fucking medal and a half.Don't care why waste debate time on an irrelevant cause.Way more pertinent things that need to be done first. This such a small issue considering everything else going on. What a waste of time and resources. What if your god is money?Yes with low importance. Honestly why give a shit? As an agnostic atheist it doesn't offend me. ""Yes it creates a bias against religions that do not believe in God""\s\sA dumb way to put itSystematically erasing history simply because it mentions a god is wrong.Who is suggesting to erase history? That was only added to the currency in the 60sThis falls into the category of things that strike me as far too petty to worry about in the face of all the REAL issues and problems we have in the country. Who the fuck really cares? It's like an elementary school argument and you know what? Let God remain on the money--given the current face of the religious right being money grubbing (I realize that's a broad generalized statement) self-serving children that pay lip service to ""God"" but like Sarah Palin would find even Jesus too liberal...their 'god' is money so the statement ""In God We Trust"" is accurate--if you identify which 'god' is being served. And...mini rant done. :pI don't see what's wrong with it.\sOur money has absolutely nothing to do with the government.\s\sWhat the privatized trust that runs the federal reserve system puts on it's monopoly money is it's own business.The whole process of removing the words from money seems a bit excessive. The words god on money I believe is not geared toward any singular religion but toward all faiths. They could just change it back to the e plurubus whatever whatever I don't even remember how to spell it. There should be no outrage as an atheist about the words on money you just shouldn't care.This is exactly what I was thinking. It seems like an all encompassing term. It's not deliberately endorsing any one religion. You don't believe in Allah or Yahweh? Ok fine maybe for you ""God"" is the mystery behind all of the universe…I dunno. But it seems like a waste of our time and resources to fight a stupid phrase on currency when theres more pressing issues.I'm Canadian and our money has no references to god.wow!  250k out of 300+ million.  That almost sounds like a Tea Party majority there.Not even that. Out of 250k only 48k voted yes. I don't think you know how sampling and polling works.\s\sHere's a hint no poll you've ever seen actually samples everyone that exists.\s\sSeriously? Whats the point in upsetting over half the population for something as trivial as this? Are we not divided enough? Fuck this shit. Just don't put it on things going forward and leave it at that. Sheesh. So you agree that it shouldn't be there going forward.  That's good.\s\sBut your argument about upsetting the majority seems to ignore the fact that Truth or what's Right isn't determined by majority vote.   Unless I misunderstood your argument?> Just don't put it on things going forward\s\sSo going forward we shouldn't be creating new printed currency/buildings with the references? Sounds...expensive.I'm strongly meh about it.I'm very against it. It's history. We don't have to print it on new money if people don't want too but leave it on the monuments. It's part of our nation's history. All the people that want to remove it need to get over their pretentious selves. We're not forcing you to believe anything. I really don't care since God could be any God anyone might believe in. They aren't making any one religion ""the one true religion"". If it referenced Jesus or any other religious figure I'd be pissed. God could be Mother Earth to someone and I don't think we should stop something so vague that it can be interpreted differently by everyone. Sensible and overlooked point. KudosPlease. We all know they mean the King James Bible God.I grew up thinking that there was separation of Church and State then I became an adult and realized that was a lie.Especially if you look at how much more secular many countries are that don't have a constitutional separation of church and state.I don't even understand why this comment is being downvoted this is true for a society that contains these links.I'm for it. The sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped to conjure up the stolen Snoden tapes or given clairvoience enough to locate the hidden... egh.. eh....[removed]Removal from monuments. .........fucking really? I don't care what you believe its a monument as is no damned changes or exceptions! Removing a reference to God on a monument in DC is defacing history plain and simple! \s\sNext thing you know these dumbasses will be going to Egypt to remove references to Ra in the temple at Karnak.  Where does this shit stop? \s""1984"" anyone?For all of those who think that 250k people is way too small of a number obviously has no clue at all about how statistics works. Polls are usually conducted with only about 1000 people and yet the conclusions you can make about the poll data are fairly reasonable for 310 million people. With a sample of 250k the margin of error is extremely small. \s\s**You do not need to have a sample size of 100 million people to yield accurate results.**Because polls on the internet linked to online atheism communities are random selection and accurately represent the United States population as a whole. You shouldn't be trying educate people on sample sizes if you fail to grasp one of the fundamental principles of statistical analysis. sample size isn't the issue its the fact that its not representitive of the population because the aprticipants are not selected in any meaningfull way. Doesn't that depend on how representative the poll is? If this is a poll that is advertised solely by the church then you'd need a census to get accurate results.Didn't they teach about how to get a ""random sampling""?  No online poll means anything. No it should be a national vote via text message like they did with American Idol.  Way more accurate than what you're suggesting. ""usually conducted with only about 1000 people"" - so if you take 1000 people from Texas who believe in God and 800 do believe you conclude that 80% of the world believes in God? You must be trolling.\s\sAnd even with 250k people they represent 310 million? Explain why that is accurate please. There are so many factors involved and I think if you'd take 250k other people maybe 1000 miles away you'd get totally different results. I really don't have a clue about statistics but I wonder how you can disprove what I just said.\sCant you extremists put our energy into something more worthwhile? Like the church tax exemptions? Or that book that promotes child abuse?i dont care. Shared on Facebook. ""vote no if you love God. Vote yes if you want your whole family raped and slaughtered by the devil""I really don't see why people are so hell bent on getting this to happen. It's not hurting any of us when we read ""In God we trust"" on our money and its not like we're all reading every dollar bill and coin we get. Ive never seen anybody look at a dollar bill and go ""IM SO OFFENDED BY THIS!!"". Even dumber is trying to remove the religious stuff from monuments and buildings. Thats way too much effort and money to have words gashed out of the stone. Plus some of the monuments are of people whos faith gave them the will and courage to do what they did. Im not any more religious than the next guy on this subreddit but I feel thats disrespectful to not grant them that. Plus that just fuels the stereotype of us atheists being petty assholes about these issues. Downvote me to shit but thats how I feel[deleted]It's as offencive is as it saying ""There is no God"". Actually it DOES offend me that a first world nation would still be flogging this idiocy in its public forums. \s\sIn Santa We Trust\s\sOne nation under Tooth Fairy\s\sThor bless America\s\sSeriously?\s\sIf ""In God we trust"" was on any bills I used I would be deeply offended. I don't believe in God and I wouldn't want to see it every time I pay for something. It would be an insult to my (non)beliefs. Paper money is used by everyone it should not be used to display historical beliefs that are obviously false. Although I'm not in America I imagine a large amount of people aren't too bothered but it's an annoyance for the state to 'promote' a religion. There's a large variety of religious beliefs and federal objects/etc containing references to a religious belief are somewhat offensive to those who do not believe in a God or any assosciated beliefs.An online poll yeah that will give a true measure of how the public feels about this....Which genius came up with this? *""No as long as there are no references to specific religions a clear separation of church and state exists""*\s\sWhat about ***""In Fucking we trust""***\s\sAs long as there's no reference to:\s\s- priests fucking children\s\s- etherosexual or homosexual fucking\s\s- same race or interracial fucking\s\sthere's no discrimination whatsoever and since the government sooner or later fucks everyone it's also highly democratic.How can you trust something that inherently doesn't trust you?\s\sAlthough trusting in nothing makes sense.Im for it. But i cannot seem to vote on it. It must be over.""Vote on this"" is somewhere on the page.  Top maybe?I like how this has 666 up votes right now.              \s\sI think that any reference to any religion should not be legal on anything federal. From money to school hallways. We are a nation founded on freedom from oppression from religion and any one religion should not be pushing their views on anyone else. Just out of Curiosity let's say 250000+ plus voted for it's removal but 300000+ voted for it to stay wouldn't that be the democratic process? I'm just saying because X amount of people are offended by it can't X amount of people say they will be offended if it is removed? \s\sI don't know how it works. Please inform me.No. That simply makes for mob-rule.  The real way to do this is to throw it at the SCOTUS every few years until they realize that it's a clear violation of the establishment clause and demand that it be removed.how much would it cost to do that? If it's a lot i think we could spend the money actually helping peopleIt would not cost anything.  The mint dies and printing plates must be renewed periodically anyway.  Do you think the 50 States series of quarters cost any more than just regular quarters?I don't care either way. I'm not religious but it won't make a difference in my daily life so it's really not a huge deal. There are much more pressing matters to deal with than this I don't care either way. Others' beliefs don't bother me. If the slogan helps others sleep well at night and it isn't preachy then it isn't offensive. Focus on the real issues where religion is being funded by government funds (my taxes).I really don't get up in arms when I see a line about God on a coin or a monument made before I was born. If I heard about a person declaring war on another country for the purpose of appeasing a god or something of that manner  I would get upset. As I think humanity should. But I don't get upset when I see people expressing their beliefs. I wouldn't demand a Catholic school to take down a sign about God either  even if not everyone in their community was Catholic. That's good. The world makes sense to them. They can hold that belief. It really doesn't effect me that much. Just a thought but isn't a slave owner more offensive then a fictitious idea?sooner or later the claws of religion will be pried from our secular gov't. it's a slow process but it's starting to snowball.Are there still people out there that don't know that online polls don't mean anything?Apparently you can vote as many times as you want.as there are already a million more important things on this ball of rock to directly concern me.....Absolutely for it.There are so many problems our nation faces completely excluding what's going on outside our borders and THIS is the issue that you guys are focusing all this effort and energy towards? Pretty funny...Don't know about you but other people can focus on more than one thing. That way small things aren't forgotten about while we are working on larger concerns.If I'm figuring this right 250000 people is less than .002 of the total number of registered voters in the U.S. which is roughly 150000000. So I wouldn't get too excited.I don't mind if. It's what everyone believed. Doesn't mean I have to.interesting to note and most interesting to me is that people said no but not because it was an important part of the founding people in the united states.\s\sthe only other thing i can think of is no keep it because of tradition.I think we all agree to change it to \s\s""IN DOGE WE TRUST""Neither I just don't give a shit.I could care less. In fact I'd rather not waste the money removing it. It means absolutely nothing to me in any way. There are a lot of other  things to do with our resources. A fairly pointless and rhetorical question considering the subreddit you posted this in.So... people want all the money recalled and have new stuff stamped and printed? Because of some harmless shit from....200 years ago?\s\sFucking retarded. Get over yourselves. Jesus. ~80% of the respondents have ""Less than High School"" education?  Something seems fishy.I'm for it but only for future installments of currency/buildings/monuments.  I think God is just as meaningful as saying the color red *is red* it's a pointless opinion.Just from currency.250k? How many people do you need to get something like this passed? Even if they got 1 million people I don't see how that is even close to a relevant number to get something to pass. Even 30 mil seems really low. There are over 300mil in America and I don't see how 10% vote on anything is enough to change something like this. So how many do you think is a relevant number to get something like this passed? Or am I daft to think a relevantly high percentage of Americans need to agree during a vote like say 51% to change something important?i dont think it should be actively removed from monuments but new monuments currency should phase it out.Xtians need god on the money for proof. ""Oh yeah well why is god on the money then huh?!""Using ""in god we trust"" as a national motto makes it seem like we have no idea what we're doing.\s\sIt's basically a formal version of ""jesus take the wheel""That should be the motto of the US Government! Don't mind it one bit.\sI honestly don't give a fuck. I also don't think it hurts anyone. It's not like your hand starts burning when you handle it or you get a sense of moral rejection if it's in your wallet. Why does it matter at all? Is it that serious? Plus the trading of physical money for goods and services is declining anyway. So that alleviates that portion of the shit fit.sort by -> website -> reddit?   \s87% yes  13% no?Fuck it remove it from currency for sure. Removing it from current monuments would be stupid. Just don't put it on any new ones.Green voters seem like the most likely demographic here to agree.    \s66% yes 34% noCrazy radicals. It's a part of our history. If they want to censor and dispan the ""God"" reference in everything? They'd be doing the same shit the evangelists attempt. Hey that feels like a very small number of people compared to our total population in America to me.I'm against removing it on currency currently it's the only thing that will help it keep its value. Religious lunatics. I'm against it but I am for keeping it off of future things.  It is part of our history and it's not even an offensive part - but now that atheism is a much larger voice in the population ignoring the request going forward could become offensive.Can we prove that God doesn't exist first?Who cares?\sNone of this matters.  Its money and buildings.  Its not a tattoo on your chest.  Do we really need to be as petty as the theists by engaging in such frivolous endeavors?  I am with not having it in the future but removing it from everything is a colossal waste of money and time. Also it's a bit extreme. It was acceptable when it was done so I don't think it should be removed from historical places etc.\sIt's such a hard argument because having the word God on things really has no bearing on your beliefs but things like having non religious people swear on the bible is a bit confusing. It's going to be a cluster for a long time.Story tells us nothing else but civilizations demise after governments went religious. \sRomans and christianity Middle east and Islam to name a couple.\sWant to fo backwards? VOTE GOD!US currency is not owned by the Federal government.  It is owned by the Federal Reserve which is a private institution.Logic and common sense should not be open to votes.meanwhile in Pennsylvania they've passed laws to put ""In God We Trust"" signs in all of the schools. Must separate the church and skate.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bXC7QMqOJQ\s\sThe worlds best funny fail carsh car compilation 2013 #1 seperation of chruch and stateSo that means how many millions are against?The money issue is probably the least important question on the website. But it asks all questions about all issues. Answering them all gives interesting results. This is silly and people dont really understand what this would fully mean.  \sYes it was added to stop communism in the 50's at least to the pledge.  But what people fail to realize is that the seal of the united states has a picture of the masonic god. It is called the Eye of Providence. You might have seen it. It is the pyramid with the capstone that is an eye? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States\s\sSo should we change that seal? Which was set up by the founders? Which has a picture of what they considered to be the supreme being. \s\s\sHey here is an idea: Let's focus on things that are more substantial and that actually matter  like :closing illegal  prisons outside the united states and release all prisoners or combantants that have not been charged in a civilian court stpo the NSA for all that they do which is illegal withdraw from Afghanistan and Iraq stop trying to overthrow other middle eastern countries stop funding apartheid israelistine stop trying to pass shifting trade agreements in secret stop hunting whisitleblowers \s\s\sI think there are better and bigger things to worry about even more than the in god we trust shit like the eye of providence on everything that we would be better spent using energy there. I think it shows how ignorant America is to put a figment of our imagination on our currency. There is no God religion is all make believe. Anyone who believes in it is ignorant and should not be allowed to be part of society. If we're going to keep God on our money might as well add Santa Clause the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. Explain how saying god is not promoting certain religions over others and well talk. Retroactively changing seems drastic. It's worth the same either way. Which means idiots are spending way too much time debating something that doesn't really matter because all that matters about money is what its worth.I completely distrust that poll as there is little to no variance as education level increases.xtians need this poll. It's proof of god. Take God off the money you're pushing a belief in God on me! Cater to my secular belief system! Seriously who cares if money says In God We Trust. It's not ACTUALLY trying to force religion on anyone. Maybe I'm just not overly sensitive? Sometimes it just seems like we create controversy over petty things.badly worded poll is bad on purpose.250k is not even 1% of the US population...Is it bad if I could care less either way? I agree. I just really don't care what it says. It could say ""In Vacuum Cleaner We Trust"" or something and it would have the same impact.I don't really know.. does that mean you care a lot? You must care a decent amount if there's room to care less..\s\sI'm assuming you mean couldn't care less?\s\sIf so don't worry about your opinions being good or bad. It's not like there's a space wizard that will judge you for them.Seems like a pretty safe place to post something like this.Posting this poll on /r/atheism is sure to yield legit results\sDoes anybody really way deep down in their heart give a rats ass if it is there?It always shocks me that people get so upset about it. Does it change the way you spend it? Does it change your daily life?I do because it's one more thing that theists use to bolster their claim of legitimacy.  Does it affect me immediately and directly?  It's hard to say except that it's one more thing that helps perpetuate (in whatever way it does) theism.\s\sEDIT: is it my #1 issue?  no.  if the chance came up to have it removed yes I'd support that removal.  it's not something that keeps me up at night though.No because we don't have the money to spend on petty bullshit. Was this one of those polls that was skewed by a link to it being posted on /r/atheism like the other one a few months ago?The current results of this poll hurt me deep inside. Removing or keeping some words on a dollar or building really doesn't do anything. Just another reason to make people feel like their opinion on the matter is better than someone else's.  If anything it has a place as part of our history so I think it shouldn't change.  Really though I couldn't care less.  I don't want any country think my country has divine powers because our money says we ""trust in god"". I think removal of such references would be a waste of resources that could be put to better use in resolving more relevant causes. It would also be defacing pieces of history similar to the Taliban and old Iraqi government demolishing ancient temples and sculptures that are relevant to the history of the nations that they originated in. Currency on the other hand I couldn't give less of a fuck. Money is money regardless of the symbolism printed on it. My debit card doesn't say shit about god. There is no comparison between removing references to god on otherwise intact and preserved monuments and what the Taliban did to the giant Buddhas.I personally thought the old ""motto"" was better not just because I'm an atheist but because it means a lot more than  ""In God We Trust"". Absolutely for it. This is the 21st century.completely indifferent.Lets waste some time on something that's never going to happen and doesn't matter either way in the first place. That's always helpful.We have plenty of other problems in the US that need tending to than this....I don't think removing the last semblance of trust from everything connected to government helps at all.Why do people get so worked up over this it's not hurting anyone For. You cant trust some imaginary dude which has no proof of existing at all. That's a pretty weak bridge for an entire country to be standing onI really don't see why I should care to be honest.it's a foot in the door for dominionists like Palin and Bachmann.Against.\s\sStupid thing to get worked up over.if it is so inconsequential to you then why do you oppose removal/phase out?Religious person here. I follow r/atheism because I actually agree with most of the posts such as the one about Texas not including evolution in their curriculum. That's bullshit and anyone still trying to discount evolution is blind. \s\sAnyway I absolutely don't agree with this. How many can honestly say they are offended by a few words on our currency? That they actually feel wronged or that religion is being forced on them? I believe entirely in the separation of church and state but this is simply not worth the trouble. Just my opinion.Read through some of the Americans in the comments. A few disagree with you on the effect of this on them.25% is better than I would think but that still means 75% are dumb as fuck.And let's scratch off all references to Zeus  off of the Roman artifacts too.  While we are at it let's burn some books. I'm an Atheist and I'm against it. Removing God from currency?\s\sDon't we have bigger fish to fry?\s\sThe national debt NSA military-industrial complex etc...\s\sShelving ideology in favor of the greater good. What a novel idea...You just put this on R/Athiesm and asked ""Are you for or against?"" \s\sGonna get some pretty biased answers here imoHonestly I don't care either way - because god has no real meaning for me anymore ... So enlighten me on why this is a big deal to continual slap down people because they choose to be sheeple and have faith- \s\s\sI was equally baffled that mosque that sued that Christmas town for displaying Christmas decorations ... If you do not believe why should it matter.  51000 in favor. Thats a whole .016 of the population.

Christianity is pretty integral to the American culture whether I like it or not. I only think that our pledge of allegiance should be changed to exclude God and our national motto should be reverted back to E Pluribus Unum. \s\sIt shouldn't be an all or nothing situation. I'm fine with living alongside religion but the integral ceremonious type stuff needs to be secular. Both of those changes were made in the 1950s so I'm going to side with American traditionalism. It is more logical has more history behind it and better represents what Americanism means. This nation is not about God it's about liberty and equality.'\s\sI'm fine with In God We Trust remaining on the coins and whatnot. It's an old phrase and a pretty clever one I'd say. \s\sI side with preserving history. I agree with everything you said except that last line. Unless you meant remembering and learning from it preserving it like we do artifacts in a museum. But preserving it as the status quo heck no. Old social constructs must die.Why would you take ""God"" off of money? To most people money is their god.[deleted]Fuck the majority.Over 250 thousand people votes and the votes are running 74% in favor of the status quo.\s\sCheckmate anti-theists.IDGAF.Seriously if you're Atheist why does it matter to you what is put on the money monument etc?  It could say ""In Clouds We Trust"" and it wouldn't mean anything more or less to me than what it currently says.  \s\sBecause there aren't people trying to make school children sing about Cloud Jesus in school. For example.\s\sHonestly couldn't care less. Who cares . If you truly are a atheist  you should not give one shit on where the god word is placed . Cause to you it means nothing and if you have a problem with people that care about it  that makes you a jerk not\sa atheist . I would rather have my tax dollars go towards holes in the road\sthen removing words from buildings .I'd rather there not be a special preference to one party.Sounds like 250k people have somehow managed to find enough time to whine about something completely irrelevant and should use that time instead to make me a sammich...I'm baffled by this answer:\s\s> No as long as there are no references to specific religions a clear separation of church and state exists. \s\sHow can anyone be so stupid?[deleted]Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.Perhaps we are asking the wrong question.I was not going to comment but I was asked.\sI do not believe in this.\sI am strongly against religion but I don't think we can really look at the word ""God"" as an endorsement of religion.\sPerhaps most of us can can live a moral life with some purpose without the existence of a God but many others cannot. \sI tend to just look at it as throwing them a bone to those who cannot live a meaningful or moral life without it being in the name of a divine being.\sPersonally seeing the word God here and there does not upset me that much its really a negligible aspect of my life.\s\sAlso I 100% agree with /u/twitch1982 in that we cannot revise history.It is absolutely *not* revising history.  Revising history is denying something ever said god on it.  Removing references to god simply means you acknowledge it shouldn't be there.  Just like the ol' US flag.  We've revised it many many times as we added states.  We're not denying that there were only 13 original states but we are saying that we think the current flag should reflect the current number of states.\s\sI think removal should be decided on a case-by-case basis by taking cost and aesthetics into account.Separation of church and state the state needs to be free from all bias.  So that means get that archaic junk off there. Sort by Party->Republican.we are the 1%You posted this on r/atheism most people here have a bad experience with religion what do you expect them to side with\sDoes it really matter!? People have to find a new problem everyday. Something created everything Until all of you atheists and scientists give me proof of what it is stfu and eat a cookie with a smile :)I say we wait until religion becomes a minority (which should only take less than a century hopefully). Atheism is the largest growing ideology (or lack of ideology) in America. I think we should wait because the longer we wait the less outrage it will cause. At the moment it is not encouraging religion it is not changing anyone's thoughts. We need a gradual removal of religion not abruptly. However monuments should still have references to God changing our monuments would be disgraceful. Like our current monuments religion can be left in the past. As for new monuments we should not include any religious reference.Lol /r/titlegore.\s\s""Over 250 thousand people vote on a poll on removal of references to God from US currency federal buildings national monuments and other aspects of government.

I don't know about anyone else but it's almost 2014 I don't use cash. When I do I don't pay enough attention to get upset about a couple words. I think they should focus their efforts elsewhere.Considering the SCOTUS has already more or less ruled on it it's sorta moot. We have real problems to solve in this country and four words on money should be pretty low on the priority list.The current ruling is that a reference to **God** is not religious which is nonsense.  It is a low priority but still something that needs to be done.  I don't really have an issue with ""God"" being on anything. Would I put it on the money if I had a choice? No. But no matter how much Christians believe that ""God"" is the name of their god ""God"" is a general term and should be treated as such. As it is it does not specify which god. I don't like religion as much as any of you but we are the minority if we recognize ""God"" as a general term. As long as ""God"" doesn't specify which religion it is referring to it represents all religions equally. \s\sWhile I disagree with how the phrase came to be on our money I feel they did a good job intentionally or unintentionally of keeping it vague. \s\sWe are not and have never been a nation based on one religion. We are a nation based on freedom. As such we need to recognize that ""In God We Trust"" incorporates ALL gods of ALL religions even the FSM if we so choose! I feel recognizing that will be a lot less painless than pissing off all the religions in America no matter how much we all love too ;). \s\sWe aren't monsters. I like to think we are reasonable people who can see many sides of the same issue. As it stands it is harmless. THAT'S where we should stand against religion when it impedes on others rights not words on money. Until it gets in the way of others rights we should let it be.\s\sAtheism has given itself a bad name in the eyes of the public by standing against little things like this. If we try to make this nation secular we are no better than those trying to make it Christian. Instead of fighting to make America secular we should fight to keep it equal. Just no. When capitalized it is a proper noun.  It is only used that way by Christians and some Jews.  An observant Jew would write it G_D.  A Muslim would write Allah.  A Hindu might choose Shiva or one of the others.  The legislators that changed the motto were clear that they intended it to promote Christianity alone.  The fact that they spoke and wrote their intentions is one of the best legal arguments that will at some future time remove it and return us to a secular motto.Instead of focusing on removing god from currency we should focus in removing the fed from our monetary system. Personally I could care less about god being on our money. I do however  care about the fed's filthy hands all over it.[deleted]Why didn't someone suggest this in 1956 when they adopted ""in god we trust"" as the motto. Apparently tradition isn't important until christian tradition is established.So we should bring back slavery?  That something that existed for a long period of time in no way is an argument to continue it.I could care less I have real problems As if the infringement of minorities has ever been so easily fixed by majority popular vote.  Unfortunately we refer to these groups as minorities for a reason.\s\shttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority\s\sAlso painfully loaded question.  Similarly try:\s\s>Should the U.S. include explicit endorsements to a specific religion that includes ONLY ONE GOD to the purposeful exclusion of all other polytheistic atheistic religions and the non-religious?\s\sEstablishment clause... No.Neither. I personally believe in god but agree it should not have anything to do with government affairs. Though I believe it's fine as long as it does not specify a religion. God is a concept every culture has had.\s\sI do believe they should take ""Under God"" out of the Pledge of Allegiance though. When you're making people specifically say it when they don't believe it it's wrong. I think people can deal with it on money etc. though.ForIt would cost too much money to ever happen. be cool if currency instead said ""In each other we hope""Do you wonder why the rest of the world think 3/4 of Americans are lunatics?well thats about .075 of a percent of americans that are opposed to having ""god"" on their money etc.\s\sso even though i am NOT a believer i think most people are like me and could give a shit if the word ""god"" is on money etc.\s\si mean its just a word who cares? (is *my* opinion)\s\sspending ones valuable time and our short lives here putting so much energy into worrying about such things seems (to me) like such a colossal waste of ones time.\s\sbut hey if getting this or that word off a coin is what truly makes you happy go for it.\sexactly its irrelevant to our time now and changing it would only benefit those who are self entitled and feel like everything needs to reflect their views. Again we live in a society where you have to compromise its not about having what you want but enough so you can tolerate those around you. Couldn't care less. Well this is a community that requires literacy as a means of communication so I'm gonna go with against.? can you elaborate on how literacy applies to the maintenance of in god we trust on the currency?I don't care what they put on it.What a paltry sum of people compared to the legion of the Lord's people.I don't care especially if it means siding with anyone on this subI'm an anti-religion and anti-atheism person intolerant of both sides.  I'm strongly DGF about this.\s\sI do think E pluribus unum should be the official motto though but I don't give a fuck about it enough to care.I am against this. Most people do not consider that however that if all mention of God are removed from government the theists will be unhappy but if they are not then the atheists will be unhappy; you can't win with this one.Either way some one gets madHow about we put ""your mom"" instead? so. Irrelevant.Fucking marxism.Will it make make any difference to society besides the goal you want to achieve? \sI support removing references to God - but only moving forwardAgainst. I'm for the ""not plastering god everywhere from now on"" mentality but if you want to take a fucking rotary hammer to a 50-200 year old piece of history you're kind of a fanatic.How long was slavery legal?Tax payers should not be paying for the  referencing of  god on our currency/buildings. Does it ever get anymore cut and dry?\s\sI'm essentially in agreement with the top comment; the old stuff can stay but no new stuff. \s\sHowever what about things like old monuments that need repair? Should they be allowed to fall apart or should we pay to fix them? What about a giant memorial cross on public land that's been there 100 years that falls over or whatever? What do you do then?Hey atheists do you believe in god?Look up the definition of atheist and you will have your answer.Remove that shit!!!God is a crock of superstitious nonsense. Remove all mention of the crap from civilized society!Wait wait there is STILL FUN TO BE HAD!!!\s\sIf you go look at the site there is a spot (top of the page somewhere) where you can take the poll BUT WAIT!!! at the end of the poll you can answer more questions. At the end of those questions the site will compare your answers with the answers of different parties in the state of tx. Try it. You may be slightly surprised with your 'matchings'.\sI think if your going to put religion on currency it should be strictly based on the president and his beliefs who is on that currency. Its only fair because they earned it.There is too much beauty on this earth for there not to be a GodThere is too much beauty on this earth for the vengeful jealous and bloody sacrificial god of Abraham to have created it. I don't really care because money doesn't exist either...just debt.Against. We actually do need a society that stands for something other than consumerism. By removing all references to God you are moving one step closer to the ""1984"" model of government. The term ""God"" by the way is not limited to any particular concept. There are as many concepts of God as there are people. Be careful what you wish for you might get it.our money isnt printed regulated or in any way related to the US government. short story long the federal reserve isnt actually federal. The Secret Service is definitely part of the US government.How curious.  I got the ""thank you for submitting your answer"" window before I even voted. \s\sThat said I'm so sick of all this ""god"" nonsense I could just vomit. [deleted]Many Christians here believe that the US is a Christian country and those not sharing their beliefs are outsiders.  As the percentage of Christians falls relative to other faiths and non-believers their privilege is being threatened.  Instead of allowing that this is a country made strong by its incorporation of many peoples they will fight to keep the symbols of their revisionist history. It is an insult. An insult to the 36% with intelligence. I think statistically speaking 36% of the American population having a brain is right on point. [deleted]The Founders were slave owning rapists.\s\sFuck them.

To me you are disrespecting the nature of our founding fathers and taking up the philosophy of the traditionalist monarch loyalists of that time.He is definitely throwing a bone to his evangelical base in hopes of cementing their votes come November.  Imagine screwing over entire classes of people just to try and win an election; truly 'draining the swamp'.Look at what Nixon did. Started the drug war waged against millions of Americans solely for the purpose of disenfranchising them.Religious freedom never have i heard such brain dead bullshit beforeThe Bible doesn't even condemn abortion...It even encourages it. Numbers 5 11-31.Let’s not pretend christians know what is actually contained in their holy book of righteous morality. If they did they’d be horrified. Haha I am sometimes so funny. I meant to say they’d find yet another way to ignore the sick stories and continue the narcissistic ideal that an omnipotent deity cares about them personally and individually.Why stop at abortions and LGBT? The bible had plenty to say about adulterers and fornicators as well as liars gluttons thieves etc.Smh these sinners be wearing multiple fabricsBecause they just want to attack women and lgbt people.\s\sLiars gluttons thieves can be men so it's ok :)we all know they only gaf when it comes to things they don't doThe bible also said something about rich people hmmm🤔🤔🤔🤔 something about a camel and a needle I believe 🤔🤔🤔getting real tired of living in an evangelical dumpster fire of a countrySo... Happy Pride month everyone! \sIronically it was this act right here that finally got my (Catholic) mother to denounce Trump today. I’m still disappointed (and disgusted) that it took this long but better late than never I suppose.Religious freedom should mean that if you believe that abortions are bad then YOU can not get one. However saying that other shouldn't also be able to get abortions because you believe so is not a religious freedom it's religious oppression as you push your beliefs on others while disregarding whatever they believe inExactly. They force themselves into corners and pretend like they are the victim of hate while enforcing systematic oppression against people because of their beliefs.Religious freedom shouldn't infringe upon others' freedomsThis is disgustingThis is just cruelty for the sake of cruelty. It's strange to imagine that there are people who enjoy doing things like this.If some people have a voting centered religion what if someone discovered a healthcare centered religion?You mean like Christian socialism/anarchism?No one's freedom should infringe on others' freedom. Anti-gay marriage people have the freedom to not get gay married but they don't have the freedom to take away the freedom of marriage from gay people. Fuck all of this.what about the freedom to not pay for abortions?Of course he did.  It was a non-discriminatory policy.  Trump wants to keep the evangelicals happy.Are we done with this crap yet?  Is the pandemic with a lack of basic provisions and throwing the entire country into chaos enough to rid us of this walking curse? Do we really need extra incentives?To distract us from the economy demonstrations and the military's criticisms of his policies.Look kids an orange man who should ne charged with crimes but will at the last minute change the lawWe need a religion that supports abortions and LGBT people so they can get in on this regions freedom.Note that he did this on the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. Up to you to guess whether that was a coincidence or Stephen Miller.What about the ""freedom"" of the person seeking the procedure?  Because of course only the freedom of ""our side"" counts.They really do take every single opportunity they can to further oppress marginalised people. It's absolutely abhorrent and I really don't know how some people tolerate and agree with it. I'd go so far as to say that they are morally bankrupt.[removed]If being gay is a choice suck my suck to prove it.User ID suspicious.I have some koolaid for them.We’ll call it the blood of trumpMaybe they should get into real Bible shit.

Although in this context it's probably more accurate to say worshipping the anti-christ.Something something false idols 🤷Donald Jesus TrumpConservatives approaching the pointMaybe because the pastors worship Trump more than Jesus?Basically a Cult with extra steps.They do!Bring a lily white Christian flag into politics it gets a little mud on it doesn't it.He's The New Messiah.At least he's a real person and not make believe.Which should make him the Antichrist?Imagine people being so stupid that Trump serves as a fitting deity. This timeline ffs it's horrible.I thought Trump is Jesus.Nop just ""the chosen one"" ®Let’s be honest:  If his flock were really worshipping Jesus they’d be voting for Sanders.Mmmm I don't think so...  I think what you ACTUALLY mean by that statement is that flocks who align themselves with the good spirit and generous heart that religion professes without any hidden agendas because they want to make the world a better place for society at large will vote for the candidate that seems the most honest.\s\sMight be Sanders or Yang who seems to have a good head.  Unfortunately those who ""worship Jesus"" are part of a membership that exercise control in order to manipulate political & business worlds.  The statement aligning religious values with a morality code is akin to arguments about the shade of red Santa Claus' suit.\s\sA wasteful argument - cause it depends on what colour pencil the artist drawing the fictional character has on handAs atheists we should recognize that indeeds Trump is the only one between the two they have any opportunity to worship & that up until this point they've only just been worshiping the church via compliance & proxy. It is by way of self-fulfilling prophesy that they've engineered themselves an anti-christ figure.\s\sA life-hacking atheist with a messiah complex would tell you this is the time to rhetorically strike. \s\sI have spokenTBF Trump has committed far fewer war crimes than Jesus' alter ego.Not for a lack of trying though.Where I come from we call those ""stupid fucks.""Boy are they gonna be hungover in a decade.  ""Grandpa why did you back a rapist?""Oh and where did they get that idea from. Hmm I wonder if it could have been from people even clergy man calling trump god or could it be from trump constantly giving a whole lot of physical support to white evangelicals.

Not that wealthy persons in every country get similar treatment if they don't just get no punishment from legal systems that favor wealth. No it's the fucking mooslemans being uniquely evil.Every powerful country does what it can to help their own. Western countries have done far worse. \s\sThe best example I can give you is USA had a team or ""tourists"" that visited Asian countries and introduce deseases to plants (fruits/vegetables). In late 1980s few of these US agents got caught. Not a single news paper in the West reported it. They hid behind NGO rights and no one went to jail. It destroy orange apple and sugar cane plantations in South Asia. Destroy the economies and helped build markets such as Florida orange market. This was/is one of the single environmental disasters in Asia! Farmers even committed suicide because they lost everything.\s\sI have zero sympathy for Americans.Don't forget the american and European business men that go to south asia to purchase children prostitutes. Or the members of us military that get special treatment when committing these same crimes or diplomatic staff or the ultra wealthy smuggling contraband or human trafficking.>I have zero sympathy for Americans.\s\scan't distinguish between the actions of a government and regular people? typical nationalist.I'm still amazed that so many people maintain their membership in an organization as depraved and demonstrably harmful as the Catholic Church. What other institutional den of sexual predators enjoys as much support as the Church?I don't even understand memberships wth. Where I'm from you just GO to church the door's open you go in at any time. Membership like at a gym?People get put down as members when they are baptized in the Catholic church and it is hard to be taken off the role. Unlike most other denominations where you have to actively ask to be a member and it is fairly easy to be taken off the list. Catholic membership is artificially high.""membership"" is a loose word.  You can't just go online and cancel.  The church claims everyone they ever baptized as a memberGOPI was raised catholic and left the church for that and a whole bunch of other reasons. The catholic church has been screwing people over for 2000 years.Take a good look at the good “Christian” in the US. It isn’t just the Catholics. It’s Christianity altogether. Some of the fundamentalist churches appear to be little more than terrorism prep organizations little different from fundamentalist Islam.Is that really the major reason why people leave the church? Not because it isn't... like true?They don’t think “their” church is bad. It’s all the other churches.Personally my grandma still has a lot of the faith but left the actual institution of Catholicism after the sex scandal cover ups came out. Ngl was kind of proud of her for sticking by her morals there when so many others wouldn'tThe Mormon churchBoy Scouts? Summer Camps?The GOP.I’d say ask Jeffrey Epstein but...those Florida churches with the child brides maybe? And Westborough Baptist still calls itself a church. The only thing all those protestant denominations can say is that they don't have global distribution and 2000 years of infrastructure that makes hiding pedopriests so easy.Idk Reddit and Discord which you use[deleted]Maybe I wish but I see more and more extreme believers.I bet the pandemic has been terrible for church membership because people haven’t gone to group brainwashing weekly for months.  Plus all those kids probably haven’t been raped for a while too.  There are going to be some horny priests when this gets going again.No they find a way. I walk at a local park and they setup shop out in the open.Why do you think they freaked the fuck out when churches got closed? They know their membership is extremely tenuous for a lot of individuals and families.Once you get over those initial withdrawals of the 3-Sunday hump it's a lot easier to quit.My parents watch a stream of their church's service every Sunday morning.  I'm sure my dad is still giving his weekly offering. \s\sMy sister's family on the other hand goes to church every week.  I think my sister has said maybe a quarter of the people are coming than normal.  At least that's good to hear.\s\sI have expressed my dislike of the Religious Right for 20 years.

I was raised to think there was a difference but the only one I've found is the conceit modern religions have to insist that all the others' supernatural tales are ridiculous.While this is a fun pithy thing to say and was once very true modern religious movements are no longer grounded in the same mindset as old religions and mythology. Mythology was mankind attempting to understand the world. Where it came from where we came from why we are here why that volcano killed my family and other big questions. Modern religion doesn't really have much truck with these questions. Too busy making money molesting kids and being thinly veiled political organizations.Maybe people are tired of being told on a weekly basis that they're going to hell.And there are some that attend tuesday Bible lectures and friday youth groups reunions So I was told 3 times a week that I'm going to hell.They make themself so disliked.  It will reach a landslide in a short time.Or they'll just change their messaging again. Remember this shit has been going on for thousands of years.More likely it will landslide as the boomers start dying or going into old folk homes.Good. Now tax them.We just need to have them follow the same financial disclosures as other 501c3 not-for-profits. If the money in the offering plate is going to help the needy then there isn’t a need to tax them. But if that money is going to the pastor so he can have a third Mercedes Benz then the IRS needs to go after them.It never made sense to me why they aren't taxed. Does anyone know the original rational behind it?The only reason I say don't tax them is because that would then legitimize their involvement in the political process.\s\sYes I know they are already involved when they shouldn't be. And that's sort of my point. Getting churches even more entangled with the government would not be a good thing. Churches would turn into SuperPACs with weekly re-funding national TV networks and devoted voters with a proven disregard for reality. I think it would cause more trouble than it's worth.\s\sThey are already dying out. I say let's not give them a reason to live. Let's just get some popcorn and watch.[deleted]Church: But why?

Cunts.Well said!👍👍👍👍👍The decrease since 2000 is remarkable.  From 70% to 47%.Praise be the internet!It’s kind of amazing how quickly this is happening.  Religion has been on the decline in America for decades but never before at even close to the speed at which it’s happening now.  Christians have really gotten good at driving people away from religion.It think it has to do with the way information travels among groups of people. Ever since the internet and the available of all kinds of information being at your fingertips people are given the choice to be informed and have the option to make more sensible choices about how they choose to live life. Also the scientific method helps us understand humanity better and what really results in a better life for everyone overall.The percentage dropped by 10% in the last 6 years.  That's really hopeful.  If it continues at that rate (and the trend seems to be accelerating) in 12 years that percentage will be down to 27%.   2/3 households won't be attending church.  2/3 children will only be exposed to religion as a novelty / history like the Norse gods.Thank God!But our people are still nuts; many Americans now just worship guns and Trump/Q.Trump is their new god.ProgressNote that the decline really took hold when the internet became almost universally accessable in the late 1990s. It's like access to information means less people turn to religion. That should tell you something about your churches their clergy and what they're REALLY after.HallelujahIf it walks like a cult and talks like a cult...Then it's a duck or maybe a goose those things are dangerous!Some good news in these trying times..It’s working republicans!  Thank youMaybe in ~20 years we see an atheist americathat would be greatPeople here are finally waking up to the cult. People in Europe woke up a long time ago.Out with old in with the new....Finally some good fucking news!Great to read!  So remind me again why the minority continues to have such a strong influence in the US?Christians are better organized and consistently vote.""U.S. church membership was 73% when Gallup first measured it in 1937 and remained near 70% for the next six decades before beginning a steady decline around the turn of the 21st century.""\s\sNow for the first time less than half the U.S. population considers itself linked to a church. Part of that is I think churches' inability to set a good example. Every day brings new sex scandals more child rape more double dealing more bullying threats of hellfire and damnation and more hypocrisy from elders who preach a standard of morality that they apply to everyone but themselves. (I'm not saying that all or even most churches are like that but enough of them are that the status of the church as a moral beacon has become fundamentally compromised).\s\sAnd reason number two I'd wager is the Internet. Right around the time when the world wide web reached critical mass religious adherence and church affiliation began to plummet. Search engines gave everyone the opportunity to factcheck religious claims. Google is the closest thing to an omniscient being that actually exists. It's easy to see how curious believers and doubters by going online got informed enough to finally dump the phantasmagorical thinking.\s\sChurch members are now a minority and their numbers will continue to slide (see England Scandinavia the Netherlands etc. for how this should play out). \s\sAs a country we've come a long way and I couldn't be more pleased.We're going to have to watch those who cling to it though. They'll get more dangerous as their way of life/control/belief is challenged and rejected. It's already started really.Queue crab dance memegreat now all we need to do is tax the shit out of themThank god! ....wait a secondFuckin' a.  Let's keep that shit rolling guys.Good !Keep goingGOOD NEWS!I would bet that it's the hateful bigotry and sheer hypocrisy that is one of the main drivers in the reduction of religious affiliation (besides the fact that it's all bullshit). The so-called ""Christian"" right are undoubtedly helping sow the seeds of their own destruction.backing this 100%Thank the Christian right! Keep up the good work of destroying religion! Yay!!! Make it all go away!Hypocrisy  bigotry and money are not the meal ticket to christian entitlement anymore . Well said Smokey !Thank God!Honestly I doubt it. Not that many people are that devout.

Basically anyone that's ever been baptized is counted so all us atheists that left the church most are still counted by them as membersIt's all about control.

Thus membership rolls are inflated because people move or end up attending different churches so get counted multiple times.Oh thank....uh....Beatiful. And it can only improve from now on.In my family we were all baptized to appease the grandparents (and once my sister had kids the great grand parents) but none of us ever set foot in church except for if somebody dies.  This played out in an amazingly awesomely sweet and hilarious way once...\s\sMy nephew in middle school at the time had a friend come over to play but the friend had to leave at 4:30pm and when my nephew asked why his friend said ""i have to go to church"" and my nephew said ""oh i'm sorry.  who died?"".  i nearly died right then because it was funny as shit but I didn't laugh because I was super stoked that my nephew was so empathetic to his friend and didn't want to give him a complex.

Speak out against the system and you're shunned wronged and burned. None of us asked for this either. The majority of millenials and up have a mutual agreement that none of us even asked to be born.

Democrats have their hearts in the right place but they’re incredibly incompetent. The republicans are psychopathic morons but they’re reaaaally good at their jobs making massive changes when they’re in power. \s\sI’d probably drop the jan 6 trials if I was Biden but knowing the republicans at this point they’d probably claim it’s an admission of guilt.What democracy??? It's been an oligarchy for a very long time!The article also cites the following \s\s**The sample sizes for each are as follows: n=499 Democrats n=395 Republicans n=143 independents.** \s\sThis means almost 50% of the people who were surveyed were democrats.

Stop complaining.\s\s>The sample was randomly drawn from Ipsos’ online panel partner online panel sources and “river”\ssampling and does not rely on a population frame in the traditional sense. Ipsos uses fixed sample\stargets unique to each study in drawing a sample. After a sample has been obtained from the Ipsos\spanel Ipsos calibrates respondent characteristics to be representative of the U.S. Population using\sstandard procedures such as raking-ratio adjustments. The source of these population targets is U.S.\sCensus 2018 American Community Survey data. The sample drawn for this study reflects fixed sample\stargets on demographics. Posthoc weights were made to the population characteristics on gender age\srace/ethnicity region education and 2020 vote history.\sStatistical margins of error are not applicable to online non-probability polls. All sample surveys and polls\smay be subject to other sources of error including but not limited to coverage error and measurement\serror. Where figures do not sum to 100 this is due to the effects of rounding. The precision of Ipsos\sonline polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case the poll has a credibility interval of plus or\sminus 3.3 percentage points for all respondents. Ipsos calculates a design effect (DEFF) for each study\sbased on the variation of the weights following the formula of Kish (1965). This study had a credibility\sinterval adjusted for design effect of the following (n=1126 DEFF=1.5 adjusted Confidence Interval=+/-\s5.0 percentage points).\sThe credibility interval for Democrats is plus or minus 5.0 percentage points; for Republicans it is plus or\sminus 5.6 percentage points; and for independents it is plus or minus 9.3 percentage points.Much more of the population are Democrats than are republicans the poll should’ve interviewed more independents but that doesn’t indicate the poll skews too far leftI know the Russia collusion hoax really showed who was intellectually honest.

He's openly admitting to making it harder to vote because [by his own admission](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus) the more people who vote the less likely it is that he'll win. How can you \*possibly\* support someone who is so anti democracy?4 years ago there were a lot of Republicans who voted for him as they though there would be 3 Supreme Court appointments 2 have happened but Ruth is holding on (ironically her staying alive may help Trump as it could be next president who nominates her replacement - or she could last another 10 years who knows) \s\sBasically Republicans were willing to suck up 4-8 years of crazy for 25ish years of owning the Supreme Court.- Confirmation Bias\s- They would rather support any republican than a Democrat. Even Trump. \s- I’m tired of coming up with excuses for this terrible manTrump supporters who still support him are just totally closed off to reality and closed to any opinion that makes them question the bubble reality they put themselves into. They will ad hominem strawman and browbeat anyone who makes them question it. They have been conditioned to respond this way. \s\sIf you call them out on being brainwashed they will also play the ""no you are"" bullshit. They are hopelessly lost and the only people who can reach them is their hero or themselves.[deleted]Well it helps that 90% of the stories complaining about him are blatant falsehoods.\s\sFor example the above?  About him defunding the USPS?  He's not.  It's a lie.  Made up.  Lies FUD and spin.  Literal fake news.\s\sWhat he's doing is refusing to give them a special bailout that the DNC is hoping for to justify mail in ballots.  Since he has perfectly reasonable concerns about election fraud and illegal electioneering why would he enable the behavior?Both parties are running ""at least our guy isn't the other guy"" candidates. It's pretty depressing.Does it even matter?  There's been at least one article a day about him doing something shady or downright illegal and nothing is done about it as much as we call him out.  I think the Republicans just don't give a fuck about humanity and are just gonna keep letting him do his dirt to kill off any hope for the next president.  I really want to be proven wrong.Vote. That’s how we start to fix this.Explore voting options here:\s\shttps://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/\s\sIn some locations you may be able to both pick up and drop off mail ballots in person before the election. The less you rely on the USPS the better.\s\sHowever you vote do it as early as possible.Trump comes from the corporate world where laws politics and people are hurdles in the way of money. He's got it in his head that government works this way. The man likely had not seen 30 seconds of the American political process before being elected. A man with no driver's licence is in the driver's seatThat was my analysis when he started talking about the Insurrection act. It's something that can be used but you're not supposed to use it without it being a last resort. Trump just sees it as another corporate bylaw he can exploit.The GOP knows they can't win in a fair election.If Biden wins and Trump isn't charged with a plethora of crimes upon his leaving of office I give up on democracy in this country.Biden specifically said he's going to make sure all the people are hired who are responsible and right for their positions and then he's going to not be involved (as is proper).\s\sBasically he's going to set up all the people who will be absolutely pursuing all the crimes that have been committed but he will not be involved so they can't claim it's a partisan attack.Strangely enough I have yet to see one ""freedom fighter"" upset about our rights being systemically taken away. Here's your moment all of you. You're wasting your opportunity.I am amazed that more people aren't upset at his executive order about payroll cuts which are really deferments UNLESS you vote for Trump because then he'll forgive the payroll cuts!  \s\sLast I checked there was a thing called checks and balances and that's why the president doesn't have the purse strings to the country.   But I guess all that constitution ""crap"" is just for some people.Call your representatives and ask them what they are doing to protect your voting rights.So trump has been railing on this for months and there is evidence to support voter fraud: \s\s[in new york](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/states-reject-tens-thousands-mail-ballots-year-s-primaries-setting-n1233833)\s\s[voter fraud map](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud)\s\s[new jersey](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/politics/new-jersey-attorney-general-announces-voting-fraud-charges/index.html)\s\s[1/5 ballots rejected](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/06/26/1_in_5_ballots_rejected_as_fraud_is_charged_in_nj_mail-in_election_143551.html)\s\sPence and I'm guessing the rest of the white house are supporting absentee voting reason being is that you have to request it so there is a clear trail of votes. \s\sThe Dems with mail in voting want to quickly issue votes to everyone based on the information currently available by the state. The problem with this approach is when is the last time you updated your address on your ID? How old is the information in the system. Which system are they using? Also if it works anything like the IRS how long are you going to wait to get your ballot? \s\sWith absentee voting the system is already established and it has a stand alone database. \s\sAs for trump saying he'll withhold funding the USPS is a service that operates under the executive branch. So he has the power to withhold funding if he so chooses for whatever reason he wishes. If you want to change that all you have to do is write a law to move it to the executive branch or force mail in to operate under UPS or FedEx1295 cases of voter fraud since 2000. Out of hundreds of millions of votes it is essentially a non isssue especially compared to other voter issues.You ever look at that Fraudmap\s\sMost of the election/voting fraud charges appear to be prodominantly local election fraud related to getting people on the ballot and less actual voting. And from the sample I took the actual ballot fraud were individuals sending out one ballot (On both sides of the aisle surprisingly)I’m confused what’s your point? That doesn’t change the point I’m making that just means the ppl who don’t completely know what there doing will have issues on top of all the other issues.No he didn't.He literally did but ok.watch the interview you muppet.If the moneys not there the moneys not there.  This doesnt sound like a ""threat"".  It sounds like he knows USPS is underfunded which is why he doesnt want a complete mail in election.  Why would ANYONE want an election run by an underfunded mail system?He has the power to fund it. He chooses not to because it benefits him.You guys do know vice is super bias and this article is more than likely fake news. Not only that mail in voting is going to disenfranchise most voters just look up the articles about how many ballots didn’t get counted cause of this or that error mail in ballots are also being  sent out to the wrong ppl ppl are getting ballots that are for ppl who no longer live there  and the democrats kept trying to slide into the COVID relieve bill stuff like no voter ID or signature requirements sounds like they want to cheat from what I can tell. Also absentee ballots must be requested so no they are not the same as a mail in ballotBallot APPLICATIONS were sent to dead people. Not ballots. Big difference.Did you know that voting by mail is something the us has done for a long time the system was scrutinized proven to be reliable and is in fact safer then if you vote on an electronic machine in person. Attacks against mail in voting to change ballots don't scale. Also voter ID laws are not a good thing because not everyone has an id. The system is super hard to influence because it is so old every trick in the book was already tried. But if you kill voting by mail.you for sure are going to change the outcome as tons of people won't go out to vote.*income* tax. Rich people don't have have income. Ugg. Please stop reporting this stupidity. You can't tax assets gains b/c those can also go down. And they do tax them when they sell stocks and what not. My understanding is there is some areas they can fix but they will still always pay low or no *income* tax. GeezusIf you read the article it only accounted for income and not investment growthneeds to change.\s\sIncrease their taxes and take some of the burden off middle and lower class workersCapital gains dividendsI just feel like the Trump administration just doesn't care anymore. He wasn't impeached and after they said a sitting president can't be prosecuted for crimes he was just like ""Fuck it. Going all in.""> I just feel like the Trump administration just doesn't care anymore.\s\sThey never cared to begin with. Now they are just not bothering to try to cover it up.“Anymore” they haven’t given a shit since day 1. Why else do you think they keep hiring people with no political experience and only does what they’re told?I mean he was impeached. Everything else is true though.and bears still shit in the woodsAs someone who is lucky enough not to live in the US I hope Trump loses the Presidency and the GOP lose the Senate just to see how bad these type of people get crushed by the Dems for corruption or if like I personally believe nothing will happen to these corrupted fucks because your whole system has been corrupted and everyone runs for personal gain not for the betterment of your country.Was always supposed to be restricted.In this case the police had probable cause that a crime had been committed which was generally sufficient. The supreme court has ruled that for some minor crimes where there is no imminent threat that isn't enough.\s\sIf the cop sees you run into your house after shooting someone they still won't need a warrant.Wasn't this literally written within the constitution?Which is why SCOTUS ruled this way. Says a lot that it was a question though doesn't it?The Fourth Amendment protects citizens but the article ends with\s\s> The Supreme Court has long held that police may conduct a warrantless search when pursuing a fleeing felon. The question in Lange's case was whether police are free to do the same thing when pursuing someone suspected of a minor offense like playing loud music. \s\sCourts have literally been allowing police to ignore constitutional rights since inception.

However once they get here I wonder how they will be treated here in America.\s\sEditThey'll fit in like all of the other immigrants who have made the country what it is over the centuries except hopefully we'll be more accepting of them than in the past.What exactly do you mean by ""Fit""?It’s so funny how people are afraid of the US turning socialist/commie yet these EO and what not have been around for decades now and are pretty fucking communist.You're out of your depth here buddy.the complete demonization of marijuana is something that i will never understand. hope this man and his wife are able to get their lives back on track after it being derailed in such a massive wayIt's really only demonised as much when its black and non-white Latinos smoking it. When its white people at worst they're ""hippies"" but seldom assumed to be thugs.The story of marijuana becoming illegal is way more messed up than I thought it was - [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5K_ogM-LqI).  Harry Anslinger was a next level piece of shit.  What he did to Billie Holiday was horrible.  His reasoning for naming the plant marijuana was racist.  His reasoning for making it illegal was both racist and ridiculously in his self interest.  Somehow he just got away with being a truly horrible person.It’s racismIt was demonized in 1970 by Richard Nixon because it was the popular mind-altering substance of choice by blacks at that time. It's never been about a War on Drugs it's been about a war on blacks. That's why when the federal government started to allow police to use military equipment the 1 requirement was that it was to be used in the War on Drugs which as I said has never been about drugs it's been about racism.  1969 Summer of Love Woodstock. Every single person at Woodstock was probably on some sort of mind-altering substance but none of them were breaking the law because drugs weren't illegal. What changed all the sudden? The person that was in the Oval Office.That so many people use that word to refer to it in English is a artefact of the demonization. Its actual English name is Cannabis. \s\shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_(word)#Early_use_of_the_term_marijuanaRemember: drugs are a victimless crime yet punished harsher than crimes with actual victims. The war on drugs was such a fucking mistake.This goes beyond marijuana. This story is a clusterfuck from start to finish. Why the fuck would a car be searched because their music was too loud? ""Oh you like to bump your music? You must be a hardened criminal.""Because people trust police too much and have the thought ""if i have nothing to hide i shouldn't resist a search."" Always resist a search its your rights. In fact giving in to a search opens yourself up to even more danger as police are excellent at making shit up.More than some rapists get! \s\sThis is what happens when you run prisons for profit in a country with such a systemic racism problem.Over quadruple what convicted rapist Brock Turner got after he committed THREE SEXUAL ASSAULT FELONIES. It’s riskier to smoke weed to cope with ptsd than to rape. Don’t know if it’s necessarily a race thing drugs have always been treated worse than sexual assault by our government despite the fact that drugs are a victimless crime.Not only did this man get more jail time than a rapist but his sentence is 10 times longer than Brock Turner.I know how you feel and I totally believe there shouldn’t be any for profit prisons but please look up the statistics; iirc less than 10% of prisons in the US are for profit. It’s important that we keep all of this in focus because otherwise we don’t hold accountable the people who deserve it.Welcome to the lad of the free #SMHWe need to legalize cannabis and the government should compensate these individuals for the time and lost job opportunities for putting these people in jail.ACABThe length of the sentence had nothing to do with his race veteran status or why he was initially stopped for. Weed charges in many jurisdictions entail a high sentence length. It’s a bit high just for some weed but I know some people like to think this sentence was because of his skin color. It’s not.They searched his car because of “loud music”. \sIf that’s not cop speak for driving while black nothing isYou do realize the only reason marijuana is illegal is because the US government wanted to use it as a weapon against latino and black minorities who used it recreationally right? That's the entire stereotype behind reefer madness driving black men to kill white people and the lazy dope-smoking mexican.\s\sAdd in mandatory minimums and you get a black veteran sentenced to 5 years because he used marijuana medicinally.\s\sThe only reason weed is illegal in the states is because of racism.Gotta push them narratives keep up the big lie.It really sucks that they do this because Texas is already the biggest producer of wind energy in the states by miles.

Brian Kemp in one of the nation’s most competitive political battlegrounds.\s\s\sThe Democrat announced her campaign with a video that highlighted her work in the state since her narrow 2018 defeat to Kemp along with a message that “opportunity and success in Georgia shouldn’t be determined by your ZIP code background or access to power.”\s\sHer decision long expected by local Democrats clears the way for what could be a titanic showdown between two longtime political rivals. That is if Kemp survives a fight for the GOP nomination first.\s\sBy AJC Marketing	ADVERTISER CONTENT\sWin tickets to see the Falcons play at Mercedes-Benz Stadium\sAbrams lost to Kemp by less than 1.4 percentage points in 2018 the closest Georgia gubernatorial election in decades and her refusal to concede defeat because of what she called an “erosion” of voting rights made her an icon to many Democrats and a villain to conservatives.\s\sIf Abrams prevails she would become the first Black governor in Georgia and the first Black woman elected governor in U.S. history. She would also end a string of Republican victories in gubernatorial contests dating to Sonny Perdue’s upset win in 2002 over Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes.\s\s\sSign up for latest news on state and local politics and elections\sTYPE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS HERE\s\sSIGN UP\sI agree to the Visitor Agreement and Privacy Policy.﻿\s\sShe’s running in a tough political environment. Despite statewide victories in the last election cycle Georgia Democrats will be on the defensive during the 2022 midterms when U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock is also on the ballot. Abrams’ campaign countered by noting Democratic gains in this year’s mayoral elections including flips of several Republican-held seats this week.\s\sHer announcement ends a guessing game among some Georgians about what she would do next. A former Democratic leader in the Georgia House Abrams is now a nationally known politician who has been talked about as a future White House contender.\s\s\sShe gave the response to then-President Donald Trump’s State of the Union was considered as Joe Biden’s running mate and started a constellation of influential advocacy groups. And she’s grown her media platform with lucrative book and movie projects and a national tour that just wrapped up.\s\s“Over the past four years Governor Kemp has exhibited courageous leadership for Georgians and guided his state through a turbulent time” said Maddie Anderson of the Republican Governors Association. “Stacey Abrams spent her time touring the country in search of fame and fortune.\s\sStacey Abrams with moderator Ursula Pari raises a hand to quiet the crowd while talking in San Antonio about voting rights.\sCredit: John David Scarcliff\s\sBut she’s also maintained a foothold in state politics pummeling Kemp for his approach to combating the coronavirus pandemic his support for an overhaul of the state’s voting laws and his refusal to expand Medicaid. Her campaign launch video emphasized her Georgia focus.\s\s“Regardless of the pandemic or the storms the obstacles in our way or the forces determined to divide us my job has been to just put my head down and keep working toward one Georgia” she said. “Because in the end we are one Georgia.”\s\sThe campaign which filed paperwork Wednesday will be led by her longtime aide Lauren Groh-Wargo. A major statewide launch is in the works for next year but Abrams’ initial steps are expected to involve small-scale meetings with Georgians and fundraising events.\s\sAbrams can count on a unified Democratic Party behind her candidacy. No other credible Democratic contender has entered the race and her fundraising record and visibility allowed her to wait until December to announce. The timing gives her a full month to raise funds in 2021.\s\sThere’s no doubt that Abrams and her allies also aim to exploit ongoing feuding among Georgia Republicans who have been engaged in a yearslong battle between various pro-Trump factions.\s\sTrump and his loyalists have vowed to exact revenge on the governor after he refused to overturn the 2020 election results and the former president suggested at a September rally that he would have preferred if Abrams was governor.\s\sFormer U.S. Sen. David Perdue is seriously considering a primary challenge against Kemp with Trump’s support. He’s told donors and activists that he’s tempted to enter the race because he fears Kemp will get trounced by Abrams next year.\s\sSeveral other Republicans have already launched campaigns premised on their loyalty to Trump including former Democratic state Rep. Vernon Jones.\s\sAn epic rematch\sWith her 2022 campaign Abrams is hoping to harness a Democratic surge she helped engineer.\s\sShe and her allies spent most of the past decade mobilizing liberals with a campaign as an “unapologetic progressive” with vows to oppose abortion limits support for new gun restrictions and other stances that many other statewide Democratic candidates avoided.\s\sBut she also embraced initiatives with more widespread public support such as expanding the Medicaid program a policy that Kemp and other Republican leaders have long opposed as too costly.\s\sHer narrow 2018 defeat showed Democrats a new path to victory that relied on maximizing turnout among voters of color who often skipped midterm elections while also appealing to suburban voters alienated by Trump.\s\sBiden captured the state in November marking the first time Georgia voted Democratic in a presidential election since 1992. Nine weeks later Jon Ossoff and Warnock ousted Sens. Perdue and Kelly Loeffler flipping control of the chamber.\s\sThe victories were particularly sweet for Abrams who passed on her own bid for the U.S. Senate and helped recruit Warnock to run instead. Back then she said “Georgia will always be at the center of my plans” even as she was coy about her next step.\s\sStill there was little mystery among her closest friends about whether she’d mount another run for governor. She’s long been drawn toward executive office and often acknowledges that she wants to eventually run for president.\s\sAn aide said that if she’s elected governor she will serve the full four-year term in office adding that the buzz about a potential 2024 White House bid is “the talk of folks who don’t know her desire to lead Georgia.”\s\s‘Unifying’\sHer ambitions will also be used against her. Kemp and other Republicans have derided Abrams as a “celebrity” candidate with little long-term interest in Georgia. And Republicans have tried to blame her for Major League Baseball’s decision to yank the All-Star game from Atlanta though she discouraged boycotts over the new voting law.\s\sShe settled another issue that dogged her during the 2018 campaign. Abrams paid off the roughly $54000 she owed to the IRS along with other credit card and student loan debt she reported during her first election run.\s\sThis campaign Abrams would also be supported by the powerful Fair Fight political organization that she launched even as she ended her 2018 campaign.\s\sThe group has grown into a fundraising behemoth collecting more than $100 million since its inception and it has blitzed the airwaves with criticism of Kemp. It has become such a formidable force that Loeffler recently started her own group Greater Georgia to counteract its influence.\s\sMany Republicans have eagerly expected Abrams’ entry and some were running against her long before she announced. Candidates for obscure political offices have targeted her and a group called Stop Stacey stocked with Kemp campaign strategists aims to keep her in front of a GOP battering ram.\s\sNo one of course mentions Abrams as often as Kemp who essentially never stopped campaigning against her. He repeatedly invoked his decision to reopen the state’s economy when Abrams criticized his pandemic policies. And he has branded her a “sore loser.”\s\sStephen Lawson a veteran Republican strategist is among the GOP operatives who have long awaited her announcement. He previously said she offers the divided state party a common adversary.\s\s“Never underestimate the unifying power Stacey Abrams can bring to Republicans in Georgia.”Written by Greg Bluestein[deleted]Can you imagine how far right he is going to have to run to win the primary?I wonder if she has to step down from her non-profit while running for election?Any sort of move that would be done out of a sake of propriety or conflict of interest can be safely ignored because Kemp certainly didn't when he ran the election in 2018.The Georgia GOP invokes her name like she’s the devil herself. They are going to freak out and band together hard.I doubt it. There is a real rift between the MAGA crowd and...sane people.>	Abrams is pro-choice advocates for expanded gun control and opposes proposals for stricter voter ID laws.\s\s>	She opposes private school vouchers\s\s>	Abrams supports criminal justice reform in the form of no cash bail for poor defendants\s\s>	she voted against Georgia's anti-BDS legislation that punishes companies that choose to boycott Israel or Israeli-occupied territories.\s\shttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams\s\sBarring the entirely possible case that Wiki is inaccurate there are plenty of reasons above for millions of Georgia voters to despise Abrams’ politics. She is very clearly on the far-left of the U.S. political spectrum. Pretending otherwise will just help elect a GOP governor similar to how the GOP could have nominated a sack of potatoes to run against Hillary and Biden and would have won both elections but instead they nominated a lightning rod clown. \s\sAbrams’ electability might be worse than Trump’s in a way because the things that people dislike about her are primarily matters of political substance as opposed to Trump’s primarily stylistic issues.LET'S GOOOOOO!…BRAAAAAANDOOOOOON!!!Oh this is going to be SO MUCH FUN!Georgia Election Info\s\s[Register to Vote](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov/GAOLVR/welcome.do#no-back-button)The worst kept secret in politics.An Abrams/Warnock ticket for 2022 is exciting. I can't wait to vote for them! I live in Atlanta and STILL see Stacey Abrams signs all over the place!Seems like my first election is going to be an exciting one!She’s the only candidate for GA Governor that has gotten Trump’s endorsement.Do you think that many MAGA heads will not vote for Kemp to make a difference? Here’s to hoping.It would be nice but unlikely.  This is more akin to Trump vs Hillary.  After years of making her out to be the greatest of evils within GOP circles that was enough to align everyone under Trump regardless of how they hated him.  Their hate for Abrams will have them working in unison even if there is a nasty primary. \s\sDemocrats find new ways to self inflict wounds. Republicans act together.It's gonna be a close election so it won't take many.I want her to win.\s\sShe will likely lose.I think her odds were better last time. She is hated by republicans and for things she actually stands for. I hope there is a challenger.Damn I was hoping she’d run for presidentA few national polls and/or the DNC begging her to run in 2024 could convince her to change her mind and run in 2024 if elected. She's much more talented than both Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg.[removed]I think she would make a great Congress rep or other state office but not governor. I’m all for what she’s touting in her campaign but she’s too anti police for me. I’m all for weed legalization and criminal justice reform for non violent crime but she jumped on that defund the police movement and no bail laws and that doesn’t help the people of Georgia. Especially Atlanta who has one of the most diverse and advanced police schools on deescalation and the city has laws against high speed persuits and violent interactions that put the public in danger. If it was some podunk police force in rural Georgia I could see them being reformed but Atlanta pd has a lot of  great people on the force.Honestly there’s no way GA’s legislature does anything that comes close to defunding the police - I think she’s going to be hemmed in majorly on any criminal justice reform she might attempt.Are they really that cheap?They’d sell your soul for a nickel and act like they did you a favor. Marjorie Traitor Greene is a tax fraud who illegally cheated on her taxes. Is there anyone truly surprised by this information?Fuck this bitchThe GA GQP will ensure that nothing happens to her -- they're terrified of Eva Taylor Braun and her (their) orange führer down in Florida.Also “Taxation is theft!”\s\sBleeding-heart idiotsI am sure the supposed law and order party will be screaming to ""lock her up"" right?   Right?  I I mean that is what should happen to tax cheats grifters people who intentionally steal.  Right?  Oh they're not.   Imagine my surprise at their hypocrisy.As much as I dislike MTG this isn't really some big scam.  She moved.  And filed for a homestead exemption on the new home she lives in now.  (At least that's what I'm getting from the article anyway).\s\sThere's not really a good way in GA to cancel your old homestead exemption if you changed counties.  They'll get around it it when you sell your old home.  You can try to be pro-active and call the county tax office for your old home and maybe they get around to it.  It took Fulton 3 years to figure it out in my case and that was with me calling them.  Yeah you would think they would be excited to charge more taxes but then you remember they would have to pay their staff enough to give a shit too.I thought the same thing. Is there a penalty for this? Or is it forgiven if you plead ignorance - which MJG can certainly get away with.>In the Floyd county application Greene’s husband **left blank the line that asked if they had another active exemption on any property.**\s\s>But Fulton County tax officials confirm to Gray that Greene never stopped getting the tax break on the Fulton property.\s\sLooks to me like it's pretty simple to not be double dipping. Just tell the truth.We know that’s true[deleted]Man you read the thoughts of those guys and you can see exactly why Republicans are where they are right now; they have absolutely zero concept of long term consequences thinking for the future or just considering the consequences of their actions. “I voted for Trump THREE TIMES” he says adding that he thought he was the best choice at the time. The best choice for what? Did you really think that the racism the xenophobia the outright stupidity was going to sustain the party with no unintended consequences? Did you really believe he was the healthy option for the party let alone the country?\s\sYou get what you ask for. The only reason that this outcome should be a shock to anyone is if they were too stupid to think further out than the election they were voting for him in. What’s more troubling is that these were politicians the people in charge of how the world around us works and they don’t seem fit to make the most mundane choices.Good. The party of insurrection deserves to lose. Spend some time in the wilderness until you can purge the crazies and re-commit to representative democracy.Something you’ve probably not considered is that when the snake eats on its own tail is that it often shits in its own mouth as well. That’s an apt description of so many of my Northwest Georgia neighbors as of late and schadenfreude has become something of a pastime in my household.Oh no.  The Georgia Republican Party is a dumpster fire.  What ever shall we do?   Where can I throw gas on it?Amazing how the maga crowd worship such a profoundly shitty vile disgusting person as donald.  Tells you all you need to know about their actual values.Trump isn't a republican. He's just using the republican party because they're easier to manipulate with the promise of money.Oh this is wonderful imagine Trump truly helping Abrams getting elected. And then imagine after that he has to sit in a GA prison because of his interference in the election.Where's the party? I want to FREE MY SOUL. WHere's the party? I want to loooose controlll.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sSorry this wonderful news triggered my inner 80s child.Wait cnn likes kemp now?Reporting the news isn't an endorsement.

I thought Trump and his gang were just a bunch of idiotic sore losers but what if this is all planned? Imagine if they wanted to start stealing elections a while back maybe even did and almost got caught in 2016. So they start talking it up constantly against the Democrats of course. They keep the noise going so long that nobody wants to hear about it and the Democrats can't accuse them of anything in future elections after insisting elections are not crooked. So now they can begin working on stealing elections without worrying about accusations because everyone is tired of that act.\s\sI may be a paranoid idiot but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. :-)Welcome.

He's also a cuntCome on  I like cunts. They are warm and comforting... unlike turd... he is a turd.He is either going to quit drop out or just coast out... he is through. It is just a matter of how and when. Good riddance.Hope he doesn’t let the door hit him on the way out.... We all still need to vote though. Every vote against him means he’ll be more dejected when he drags his saggy ass out the door.Someone should ask: ""What are your plans for your dacha near Moscow?""  Let's see what he says.It’s because he can’t say “I plan to continue to fleece the American public out of every cent I can possibly steal through all means at my disposal.  Thanks to my party controlling the Senate I can do whatever I want with no oversight.  My wealth will be huge while I won’t pay one red cent in taxes back cause it is all being laundered overseas like I used to do for the Russian mob in my casinos.  After my second term I’m jetting off to Moscow to live out the rest of my days like a king while you plebeians wallow in the filthy dystopian wasteland I leave behind.”\s\sHe can’t say that for a few reasons.\s1.) It contains words he doesn’t know or understand.\s2.) It contains the truth.He needs to ask Putin what to do.His face says it allThat’s because he never knows what he’s going to do until either Putin or Fox pulls a string.  It’s a surprise to him too.Well if he had goals they would probably be unbelievably shitty ones. So I’m somewhat relieved?His plan is golf and Twitter.Vote blue no matter whoTrump has previously said ending Social Security and Medicaid/Medicare is his goal during a second term. Hannity failed to point that out in the tape I saw.The only remaining question is ""will the Trump family executions be free or pay for view"".He could have just said ""Keep owning the libs"" and received rabid applause.

Unfortunately THIS is what it will take to get the administration to do something. Eventually.Let’s take an example: one of trump’s “children” gets and becomes critically ill (G-d forbid); trump would then blame Joe Biden for not doing anything to stop it. How do I know? He’s blamed Obama for the outbreak being as bad as it is and in relation to BLM has shown footage from just a few weeks back of violence and then blamed Joe Biden for it. So we can extrapolate. trump will almost certainly do nothing useful on this point no matter what.Karma can be a horrible thing.Welcome.

I wish I could give it more than one upvote but unfortunately only those of us on the side of reason sanity and humility will ever read it.  Trump’s slowly shrinking base will only see or hear the lies of Fox “News” the major Trump apologists in America.He just got emergency powers handed to him on a silver platter today. Spend 10 seconds thinking about what he is going to do with that.These types of “Trump is finished” articles need to stop coming out.\s\sIt’s wishful thinking at best and at worst makes his critics complacent in thinking “well I surely don’t have to do anything now that EVERYONE has OBVIOUSLY seen the light.”\s\sNo they haven’t. His base will never abandon him no matter how bad he fucks up. Any notion of “well he’s OBVIOUSLY finished now” needs to stop since even if they were literally on fire his base would blame the democrats and never see things for the way they are. \s\sWishful thinking at best actively harmful at worst."

Under the revised plan which is backed by the Biden administration banks would be required to provide data on accounts only with total annual deposits or withdrawals worth more than $10000 rather than the $600 threshold that was initially proposed. **The reporting requirement would not apply to payroll deposits for wage and salary earners or to beneficiaries of federal programs such as Social Security.**\s\sBasically your weekly/bi-weekly direct deposit from your job is not subject to this reporting requirement.  Logistically it would be a pain in the ass to implement something like that due to the sheer number of reports the IRS would need to review.

They were working on submitting the paperwork and getting members of the House Freedom Caucus to sign on as a show of support.” This is an interesting development.  I wonder if this is why there was such a fight to not form an investigative committee.  Will be following this story closely.This makes perfect sense of course. However I'd like to see some investigative reporting from a weightier publication than RS.The same people who ignored the obvious quid pro quo in “I would like you to do us a favor though” will be the ones saying ""There's no specific call for violence from anyone in congress or the administration"". \s\sThe ones who will read into any statement made by the democrats and extract a malicious intent won't be able to see that Trump and his people may not have specifically called for violence but violence was inevitable due to their actions. \s\s*""I didn't tell my kid to beat the neighbors dog on the 25th but the thing barked constantly and I often use violence to solve my problems.

I am not sure that just evidence of communications prior to the criminal acts of Jan 6 is evidence if being complicit unless those communications knowingly facilitated the criminal acts of Jan 6.\s\sHeck the Scalise shooter communicated with his Congresspersons regularly and volunteered on Bernie Sanders campaign (with regular ""communications""). That doesn't make them complicit in his choice to try to kill various members of the House/Senate as a baseball practice.\s\sThey very well may have been involved but I am going to wait for more evidence than the claims of a bunch of yahoos who have already proven to be criminals.The obvious difference that makes this a false comparison is that no congressional democrat nor anyone from their offices invited the Scalise shooter to the ball game. \s\sEvery single person at the capitol that day was an invited guest of the president and congressional republicans and it doesn’t matter what else comes from the investigation.

If the Republicans take back the House in 2022 then the first thing they're going to do is disband the January 6th commission. Every act the Trump administration people are taking is to drag this out until the midterms. They know that this commission has a shelf-life and they have no problem using Republicans in congress to run interference for TFGs crimes.When President Trump was going to be impeached the second time my rep John Curtis argued that the process was too rushed for such a sobering decision. He later voted to remove Liz Cheney from leadership and said it was time to move on from January 6th. Kind of crazy how fast it switched between “whoa this is happening too fast!” to “Wait why are we still talking about this?”  \s\sIt’s depressing that there was never going to be a process they supported as “just the right amount” of time and depth.Let’s go!\s\s[press release from DOJ](https://twitter.com/thejusticedept/status/1459263199228870663?s=21)What is the penalty for criminal contempt of congress?Each count carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail as well as a fine of $100 to $1000. He's been charged with two counts.About time.Let's goooooo!I'm not sure about this. I have family that has personally received a vaccine shot. I suspect and from what I've read the Federal Government intended to build stockpiles with the manufacturers and then distribute them to the states letting the states decide the best way to get those vaccines into the arms. The criticism seems to be that there was zero federal plan to actually do anything on the federal level. Everything was to be run at the state level.\s\s>The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help. - Ronald Reagan\s\sThis seems like a regular conservative approach to most problems. No heavy-handed federal policy just give the states the tools they need to handle it the best way they think it should be handled.\s\sI've been wondering for a while now has the pandemic changed the way conservatives or libertarians see the federal role in a crisis like this? I know we have a few libertarians who contribute here. From your perspective what's the role of the Federal Government in handling a crisis of this magnitude? Is the Trump administration response the right way to go even if it means a slower more scatter-shot response or is a federal response warranted in times of crisis if they can be more efficient (counterintuitive I know)?\s\s&#x200B;\s\sETA: Fauci [shot this notion down yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus) in his first briefing for the new administration. There has been a national response but it's been inadequate.There is a part of me that likes the federalism mindset of let states and local governments they being closer to the people be in charge of most distribution. However I think some states dont have the human resources in government to do it well. And if elected officials have a political incentive to downplay the need for a strong response to a crisis there can be more trouble. The US is so connected that one state suffering harms other states.\s\sThe US has a strange relationship with federalism. Our constitution and laws are based on federalism but a lot of the way we think as Americans is much more like a Unitary government.\s\sEdit to add: Because the US is so connected it is my opinion that in a crisis a strong federal response would usually be the best route.Trump's entire COVID plan was to have states develop plans tailored to their needs and demographics. I could believe a title that said ""Trump had zero plans for COVID Vaccine last-mile distribution \sperformed by the federal government"" but knowing a local hospital administrator very well they have received multiple shipments of the vaccine starting in mid-December and have done A LOT of vaccinations.\s\sAt the current time every doctor dentist assisted care facility and home health care profession I know has been vaccinated twice. As EQP I have had reports that every ward member in an assisted care facility now has received both doses. I also have reports starting to come in that pretty much everyone over 75 and those 60+certain medical conditions in my ward have had their first dose.That's why I was skeptical about the framing of this article. Both can be right. There could be zero federal response and still you could have states that have done a superb job. I don't know what state you're in but in Utah I'm seeing an underwhelming rollout. Some of that may be due to large groups of people being unwilling to get the injection for a hundred different reasons. From the national numbers we know the Trump administration of 20 million injections and they only had 12.4 million that had made it to the states. \s\sI'm still curious about libertarian views on the appropriate federal response in a large scale crisis like this though.

Must be nice to be held to such a low standard.I will never understand why this isn't a bigger deal particularly for conservatives.\s\s>**L**ast year John Eastman whom CNN describes as an attorney working with Donald Trump’s legal team wrote a preposterous memo outlining how then–Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the 2020 election by fiat or failing that throw the election to the House of Representatives where Republicans could install Trump in office despite his loss to Joe Biden. The document which was first reported by the Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their new book is a step-by-step plan to overthrow the government of the United States through a preposterous interpretation of legal procedure.  \s>  \s>Pence apparently took the idea seriously—so seriously in fact that according to Woodward and Costa former Vice President Dan Quayle had to talk him out of it. Prior to November the possibility of Trump attempting a coup was seen as the deranged fever dream of crazed liberals. But as it turns out Trump and his advisers had devised explicit plans for reversing Trump’s loss. Republican leaders deliberately stoked election conspiracy theories they knew to be false in order to lay a political pretext for invalidating the results. Now more than 10 months after the election the country knows of at least five ways in which Trump attempted to retain power despite his defeat.  \s>  \s>**1. Trump tried to pressure secretaries of state to not certify.**  \s>  \s>Trump held early leads in vote counts in several states—not because he was ever actually ahead but because of discrepancies between when states count mail-in ballots and Election Day ballots. This so-called blue shift was written about long in advance of Election Day and was partially the result of Trump’s own attacks on voting by mail. Nevertheless Trump made this a key part of his election conspiracy theories (as many predicted he would) insisting that Democrats were somehow inserting fraudulent ballots into the vote count in the presidential election (something they apparently forgot to do in close House and Senate races in which Democrats did worse than polls had anticipated). To help substantiate these falsehoods  the Trump campaign attempted to pressure secretaries of state to either not certify the results or “find” fraudulent ballots. In some states spurred by the president’s fictions pro-Trump mobs showed up at vote-counting sites and attempted to disrupt the proceedings.  \s>  \s>**2. Trump tried to pressure state legislatures to overturn the results.**  \s>  \s>Trump personally attempted to coerce state legislators to overturn election results in a few states that voted for Biden on the dubious legal theory that such legislatures could simply ignore the results of the popular vote in their own states. In Pennsylvania Michigan Arizona and Georgia Trump publicly urged Republican-controlled statehouses to “intervene to declare him the winner” and tweeted “Hopefully the Courts and/or Legislatures will have the COURAGE to do what has to be done to maintain the integrity of our Elections and the United States of America itself.” As my colleague Barton Gellman reported last year the Trump campaign discussed “contingency plans to bypass election results and appoint loyal electors in battleground states where Republicans hold the legislative majority.”  \s>  \s>**3. Trump tried to get the courts to overturn the results.**  \s>  \s>The embattled attorney general of Texas Ken Paxton filed an absurd lawsuit demanding that the Supreme Court void the election results in Wisconsin Georgia Michigan and Pennsylvania four states Biden won. The large majority of the Republican delegation in Congress as well as nearly 20 Republican state attorneys general supported this attempt to get the conservative-controlled Supreme Court to overturn the 2020 election results by fiat. The justices declined to crown Trump—but the amount of support this bid received from Republican elected officials is itself alarming.  \s>  \s>As part of this effort we can include the baseless “Kraken” lawsuits filled with conspiracy theories about vote changes. Trump attempted to coerce the Justice Department into providing him with a pretext to overturn the results but his attorney general Bill Barr refused to do so. Had DOJ leadership acquiesced it would have lent credibility to Trump’s other corrupt schemes to reverse his loss. In a meeting with the acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen according to contemporaneous notes taken by Rosen’s deputy Trump said “Just say that the election was corrupt \[and\] leave the rest to me.”  \s>  \s>**4. Trump tried to pressure Mike Pence to overturn the results.**  \s>  \s>It is hard to pick the most ridiculous means of executing a coup but insisting that the vice president has the power to unilaterally decide who won an election is up there. Trump publicly hounded Pence to reject the results prior to the traditionally ceremonial electoral-vote count in Congress and Pence reportedly took that demand seriously enough to seek advice from Dan Quayle on the matter “asking if there were any grounds to pause the certification because of ongoing legal challenges” according to Costa and Woodward. That this got so far is profoundly disturbing but even more disturbing is Eastman’s memo which shows that the Trump team had thought very deliberately about how this scheme would work.  \s>  \s>According to the memo Pence could refuse to certify the results in particular states giving Trump more electoral votes than Biden and Pence would declare Trump the victor. If Democrats objected (as surely they would) the vote would then go to the House. Because the Constitution gives one vote to each state in disputed presidential elections and the Republicans were the majority in 26 of 50 state delegations the Democratic House majority would be unable to prevent Republicans from throwing the election to Trump. The election-law expert Ned Foley writes that the scheme would likely not have prevailed given the Democrats’ ability to prevent a joint session but that seems almost beside the point which is that a sitting president and vice president were considering how to keep themselves in power following an election they lost.  \s>  \s>**5. When all else failed Trump tried to get a mob to overturn the results.**  \s>  \s>At the rally prior to the vote count in Congress Trump urged the crowd to act saying “If you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.” The explicit goal of the rally and subsequent riot was to pressure Congress and Pence in particular into overturning the election results. Trump told his followers “If Mike Pence does the right thing we win the election.”  \s>  \s>This scheme didn’t work on its own but it certainly could have helped one of the others: Imagine if Pence had gone along with Eastman’s absurd plan and a mob had been present at the Capitol to help enforce the decision and menace lawmakers who tried to oppose it—then what? As it stands the mob ransacked the Capitol and forced lawmakers to flee. Had the mob succeeded at reaching any actual legislators the consequences could have been catastrophic.>Trump was impeached for his incitement of the January 6 mob but Senate Republicans dutifully prevented him from being convicted and barred from holding office ever again.Those who attempted to subvert democracy have faced few political or legal consequences. As is typical some rioters are facing prosecution while the elites who tried to overthrow the election through more bureaucratic or procedural means remain in good standing with their peers. The failure to impose accountability for an attempt to overthrow the constitutional order will encourage further such efforts.  \s>  \s>**Meanwhile those rare Republicans who did stand up against this attempt to destroy American democracy are the only ones dealing with real political consequences from their party facing primary challenges being forced into retirement or being stripped of their leadership positions. Republican officials who were unwilling to use their office to overturn the election results are seeing challenges from Trump devotees who will should the opportunity arise again.**  \s>  \s>If Trump had succeeded many of those downplaying the former president’s actions would today be rationalizing an American coup. No you see George Washington and James Madison intended for Donald Trump to be president for life. Read the Constitution.  \s>  \s>At the core of these attempts is a dangerous ideology—the presumption that because Trump supporters represent “Real Americans” the will of democratic majorities can be disregarded. This does not mean that the Republican Party is capable of winning majorities but that winning them is irrelevant to whether or not the party’s Trumpist faithful believe they are entitled to wield power. Win or lose their claim to be the sole authentic inheritors of the American tradition means they are the only ones who can legitimately govern and are therefore justified in seizing power by any means. This is the modern incarnation of an old ideology one that has justified excluding certain groups of Americans from the suffrage on the basis that their participation is an affront to the political process.  \s>  \s>American traditions of unfreedom always represent themselves as democracy’s protectors rather than its undertakers and this one is no different. If Biden were allowed to take office Eastman insisted in a longer version of his memo “we will have ceased to be a self-governing people.” The catastrophe is not only that Trump tried to overthrow an election. It is that so many Americans were cheering him on.\s\sI would add a 6th item. Trump supporters are still trying to overturn the state electoral results. The ""fraudit"" in Arizona is just one such attempt but other states have discussed and even announced their own versions of a Cyber Ninja fiasco. This only ends one of two ways either a Trump-like character succeeds at some point and Republicans have installed an authoritarian or Republican politics so turn-off the electorate that they want nothing to do with them for a generation. Why Republicans view either outcome as acceptable is beyond me.If not punished harshly they will try again next time. And they may succeed.Mike Lee said something to excuse his hypocrisy during the many outrageous executive power plays of Trump’s about being totally willing to make legislation to limit presidential power.  Let’s see how he handles this and how he votes on the executive power limiting bill that Democrats put forward recently.Mike Lee is safe. The conservatives here in Utah like him and will tolerate things from him that they wouldn't tolerate from anyone with a (D) next to their name.

While disavowing that history donors — like Charles Koch Betsy and Dick DeVos and the Walton family (Walmart heirs) — have continued to push school privatization.  \s>  \s>Shock Doctrine author Naomi Klein predicted in March 2020 that COVID-19 presented an ideal opportunity for “disaster capitalism” a tactic pushed by school privatizers in the wake of the last financial crisis. She identified the global pandemic as a “shock” or disruptive event that global elites often use to introduce free-market “solutions” that redistribute wealth upwards.   \s>  \s>Klein’s prediction has been largely vindicated with governmental efforts like Trump’s Paycheck Protection Program going mostly to huge businesses several with ties to Trump and his family. A report this month found that the wealth of the world’s 10 richest men doubled during the pandemic as incomes dropped for the 99.99999 percent.   \s>  \s>School privatizers including some of these new “parent” groups have keyed in on this opportunity in education. In the wake of the pandemic the Koch-funded group “Yes. Every Kid.” released its “Opportunity in Crisis” report proposing a variety of privatization schemes according to an investigation by UnKoch My Campus and Save Our Schools Arizona.\s\sWhen dealing with some conservative movements you have to [follow the money](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astroturfing).

It was an attempted coup. It's an ongoing attempted coup.It's remarkable how brazen of a power grab this is. Antrim County is a small rural county in northern Michigan. Republican presidential candidates has won every election there since 1964. In the 2020 election Trump won the county with 61% of the vote with a voting margin of about 5000 votes. In comparison in 2016 the county voted for Trump with 62% of the vote and a voting margin of about 4000 votes. This county was a pretty good result for Trump but is not nearly big enough to change the results of the state even if there were irregularities. The county has a total population of 23000 people.Sooo coup?This is why QOP is busy changing election laws.

Various other doomsdays theorized by the QAnon community have also come and gone without incident.\s\sBut unlike those past days Biden's inauguration leaves the community with little daylight.

Here's his quote:\s\s>When I use the word 'censor' here I'm meaning blocked content fact-check or labeled content or demonetized websites of conservative Republican or pro-life individuals or groups or companies \s\sThe way I read that isn't simply that ""fact-checking is censorship"". But fact-checking only applied in one direction would certainly meet that standard. The NY Post is still locked out of their Twitter account. Has anything like that ever happened to the New York Times or the Washington Post? Or even outlets like Vox Huffington Post or Mother Jones?\s\sIt may be the area where people are most frustrated with me as a mod but I'm extremely hesitant to engage in any kind of policy of routinely removing comments based on false or allegedly false information. It could very quickly become censorship of minority viewpoints and there is so much subjectivity on some of these issues for me to feel qualified to remove on the information on the basis that it objectively untrue.That is a good point but I dont think its Lee's point. I'm with you on the NY post thing that's fishy. Lots of conservative content gets demonetized or banned because they are inciting violence or spreading dangerous misinformation and they say the reason for it is that they're conservative. I think that's what Lee is referring to but you're right conservatives now have some legitimate gripes which makes the other actions I was referring to seem illegitimate as well.The 'censorship' is due to deceptions falsehoods and manipulations not partisanship. \s\sThere isn't subjectivity on these issues. It's the use of the dunning - kruger effect to make factual information seem subjective.This is working the refs.  Learning from Trump and Fox.

At least 800 civilians have died and thousands have been arrested in protests that have wracked the Southeast Asian nation in the months that followed.\s\sSupporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory have praised the Myanmar coup and called for the U.S. military to do the same citing unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.\s\sFlynn a former Army general was fired by President Donald Trump in 2017 after less than a month as his national security adviser after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence. After pleading guilty to making false statements to the FBI during the Mueller investigation Flynn moved to withdraw his plea and the Justice Department dropped charges against him. A federal judge ruled the matter be placed on hold but Trump pardoned Flynn last November before a ruling on whether the Justice Department could drop the criminal case against him.\s\sLast summer Flynn posted a video on Twitter TWTR -0.14% reciting QAnon slogans. Twitter banned Flynn and others in January in a purge of accounts promoting QAnon theories.This is what they tried to do January 6. Republicans: ""they were just tourists lol""I find it very  very interesting that our resident ""block everyone I don't want to have a serious conversation with because I'm too big a snowflake"" will post racist trope and call racism a hoax while posting unverifiable bs with ""anonymous"" people saying stuff can't find it in himself to comment on something Michael Flynn actually said.\s\sI still have connections in Tulsa so I went to several of the local channels to see if what Gilbert posted about was being reported by legitimate local station.   Not a peep.  Nothing.   \s\sWhat I also find interesting is our local conservatives will post racist bs clutch their pearls but never comment on comments make by those who are a real danger to our country--authoriatian coup makers like Flynn.\s\sThey also don't seem to want to learn about the Tulsa Massacre wo they can see what atrocities actually happened in this country.  What black people have had to actually face for the last 100 years.  [The more I learn the more sickened I am becoming.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre)  If they don't want to learn from the documentaries made by national organizations here is a [local station](https://www.newson6.com/story/60afbd84c110780be1631f05/tulsa-race-massacre:-hope--healing).  The post that was taken down was spewing the same false rhetoric that was being spewed in Tulsa 100 years ago.   Where the police investigated and did not arrest the  young man but an inflammatory yellow journalism piece in the evening Tulsa Tribune caused all of this to escalate to the point where Rowland was taken into custody homes and business were burned people made homeless and many deaths.     The Tulsa PD deputized the white mob and provided guns.  The national guard was called out.   Planes dropped bombs.   Yet nothing has been done to this day by the governments who caused this tragedy for the victims of the massacre.  \s\s\sYet we see the same crap being posted about ON THIS VERY SUB.  Those posters have NOTHING to say about actual coup attempts and people spout calls for coups to happen.  NOT ONE WORD.   If they had the courage to talk about this instead of spreading misinformation about racism I would have more respect for them but as it is I have zero respect for them.\s\sedited to add: https://www.news9.com/tulsa1921   I prefer to watch what local people have to say about their communities that read trash articles posted by someone who says ""iM nOt a rAcISt"" but post racist articles that cannot a bit shifty and the same old crap that caused a massacre 100 years ago.

And that’s just private costs. I’m sure you could instead use this subsidy for like $5k per home (rest paid by homeowner) meaning 8 million homes or most of California (13 million homes in Cali). I’d imagine we’d have an easier time managing wildfires if many homes were on solar.stop padding failing industries and let newer ideas take over.. Funny how republicans can't see the ""capitalism"" in that...About fucking timeOr fix our failing infrastructure which will create more jobs. Or both.Hmm. Sort of like FDR's New Deal? Except with some green energy investment added in? I wonder what we could call such a thing? 40b would be a good start.Give it back to the taxpayers in the form of more Covid relief.What are the subsidies they are referencing? The article was vague to say the least.Get fucked BannonImpeach convict and remove now.So he'll get charged and convicted of election fraud right? Seems like a case could be made for mail fraud too.AgreedSigh......you’re new here aren’t you? This is trump. Literally nothing will happen to him. Other than the occasional minor inconvenience or slap on the wrist the man lives a consequence free lifeThank God I don't live in a shithole country where dictators openly tamper with elections and.........oh.I live in Canada and I'm praying for Biden to win. It's horrible seeing all the injustices happening in the U.S. Trump supporters are just terrible people honestly.Can you use ups or fedex to return mail in ballots?>Can you use ups or fedex to return mail in ballots?\s\sIt depends on your state.  Elections are governed by the states.  \s\sThe process in many states seems to be that you have to apply for an absentee ballot.  Some states will let you do this online.  Others require this to be mailed.  In some states you can drop this off or you could UPS/FedEx it.  Then the state mails the absentee ballot via USPS.  You have to return it.  Some states allow them to be dropped off.  Some may allow UPS/FedEx.  Some have specific envelopes that they must be returned in and those envelopes can't be altered in any way.  \s\sYou absolutely must read the instructions in your state.UPS is even worse. I had to get a post office box just to stop them destroying everything I order from Amazon.No but there are ways to circumvent the Post Office like dropping your mail in ballot at a county office or town hall or a dropbox. Also you can vote early in person to avoid lines.[removed]Just drop off your mail in ballot and get the word out that everyone can just drop it off themselves100% agree. I think it’s a mistake to rely on congress to get this fixed by November. I’ll be voting in person.I heard the audio of Trump saying this and it's shockingly disgusting. He's blocking millions of Americans from getting money needed to survive so he can sabotage voting and win the election. How on earth is he still in office?It’s almost like he wants to get impeached and removed so he doesn’t have to lose in November.Maybe that explains why the House isn’t doing anything to stop him. They don’t want to give him what he wants.Rightwing mail spammers will likely also send a tidal wave of junkmail to further cripple the USPS around election day bringing whatever capability left to a complete halt.Can community members go door to door to pick up and drop off sealed ballots at polling stations?No there are laws about collecting ballots.I think California is one if not the only state to allow that.I guess the campaign should also be pushing early voting and picking up ballots at the Registrar's Office and then find a ballot drop box. Is there a website to help people navigate the system in each state (hint hint)?Explore voting options here:\s\shttps://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/\s\sIn some locations you may be able to both pick up and drop off mail ballots in person before the election. The less you rely on the USPS the better.\s\sHowever you vote do it as early as possible.I’m beyond frustrated. The idea Mike Bloomberg doesn’t drop a billion dollars into a multi state ad barrage telling folks how to vote properly is insane to me.  Literally he doesn’t have to focus on any other issue but voting and he has the money to do it.  Just absolutely swamp the battleground states with information constantly and everywhere.  \s\sWe can’t sit this one out folks.Literally if he was the president of some other country the American secretary of state would be obliged to denounce him in the United Nations.Ok so will this actually work? I'm genuinely concernedNot if ENOUGH people vote against Trump.\s\sRemember Trump has to produce election numbers to stay in office.  Otherwise legally the Speaker of the House takes over (a Democrat).\s\sAnything he does to hurt mail-in voting also hurts his own base.  It's a fairly blunt weapon of Voter Suppression/ Election Fraud- and a last resort for a would-be Dictator who sees justice on the horizon coming for him...\s\sTLDR: No matter WHAT Trump tries he WILL be held accountable if enough people turn out and vote against him.[removed]They are not they have an emergency bill in the House right now.Here's the unfortunate reality. There's only so much democrats can do. They can subpoena the post master general for a hearing and then....? If there's something that the Trump era showed is that congressional power of oversight is toothless. It's one thing to have a rogue president to nuke the postal service but another one having an entire major political party cheering him on while he does it without any regard for their constituents. It is already known that republicans are willing to hurt their voters if it means winning elections. It happened 10 years ago when gop governers refused to expand medicaid because it would be seen as giving Obama a ""win"" and then they blamed Obama for the closure of rural hospitals. \s\sEven then if republicans jump along Trump can veto any funding bill that doesn't have a veto proof majority. Unless Trump starts feeling major heat for this unfortunately nothing will happen.I mean.. This kinda screws Republicans too especially seniors who rely on VBM. T didn't think this one thru.Apparently some sort of spending bill is needed to avoid a shutdown on 10/1 so I can see things getting pretty interesting.[removed]Troll!\s\sSeriously I looked up your post history.  Troll extraordinaire.  Spreading disinformation all over Reddit.  Trying to provoke anyone you can...\s\sFellows Dems let's join in reporting this Malarky Merchant!By the way Trump just said he would not veto a bill with funding for the post office so that should be a red line for democrats.Not?  Or would?\s\sAlso: source?  So others can spread the news if this is trueKeep in mind the voters that are on this list are mostly Black Americans. Something is very wrong here.> Something is very wrong here.\s\sIT is not a bug but a feature of the republican party's design.Unfortunately it's not illegal. Just immoral.should be illegalYES Bernie! Thank you! To all my fellow progressives: listen to this man! Vote for Joe stop Trump!I have always loved Bernie and would have supported his nomination both this year and in 2016 were I American. Right now by championing Biden/Harris he illustrates even further why he is so deeply deserving of respect. \s\sI suspect nonetheless that I'd have stayed far away from many if not most of his ""progressive"" followers.... Anybody in my opinion who is perfectly OK with running the risk of another Trump victory is a self-entitled privileged moron who does not deserve the description of ""progressive."" If they are *that* blind and *that* beholden to ideology... they are no better than Trump cultists. \s\sAnd I say this as somebody who is to the far left of the spectrum by Canadian standards (which tilts quite a bit further to the Left than the US political spectrum). Trump must be defeated at all costs period. Or to put it another way ""There are two choices: America or Trump.""For a lot of college Bernie supporters this is their very first election and yet they think they're owed complete control of the Democratic party for some reason. Many of us Biden supporters have been volunteering for and donating to democrat campaigns since before they were born. And if they cant have every single thing they want right now this election they're going to sit home and pout on election night\s\sI've got nothing against the squad for what they do but I'd like to see an ultra progressive win a Senate race in a purple state or even a toss up house district before we make rashida tlaib speaker of the house. Just saying.I continue to be amazed by how some of his supposed supporters are acting. My 10 year old and I had the privilege of seeing Bernie back in February at his Tacoma WA rally. Bernie was adamant that Trump needed to go over everything else due to the constant danger and threat his corruption poses to this country. This was his biggest message was that people will continue to suffer if we can't rid this country of Trump and he's continued to repeat it since Joe won the nomination. Bernie has also said repeatedly that while he may not agree with Joe on everything politically that Joe is a good man who is willing to listen.   I truly hate the level of privilege and entitlement some people are feeling that would lead them to think another 4 years of Trump is acceptable. We need an adult in charge right now and that sure isn't Trump.Just look at some of Bernie's supporters. Rose Twitter pricks. No wonder they're acting so privileged.\s\sAlso I believe Bernie's better as hype man than president. Some of his picks were really questionable. Like how the fuck's Joy Gray a girl who's only political editor and picked third party in 2016 to boot got picked as his press secretary? I don't know but I feel like it's some kind of yellow flag warning for Bernie.Many people on my social media are saying that NOT voting is better than voting for Biden and Harris. One went as far as to say they are “as bad as Trump.” The people saying this are former Bernie supporters. \s\sHow do we reason with people who think not voting is an option? I personally think that Biden and Harris will do a great job despite the fact that I previously supported Bernie. Besides that...anyone is better than Trump.They’re a lost cause at this point. I would only recommend countering any claims from them for the sake of any lurkers that are on the fence seeing their posts.Rosie o donnel is better then trump kim kardashian is better than trump hell even kanye.... Well i don't know about kanye but u get my point.I'm in the same boat. Lots of people I know who helped hand trump Michigan last time because they voted for stein or stayed home are talking about doing the same thing again. They live in a bubble of confirmation bias just like trump supporters do. But i do think those bubbles are getting smaller.. Keep spreading the right information. Keep calling people out. I don't know if it helps but I don't think it can hurt as long as you stick to the facts and resist all temptations to call them spoiled brats (easier said than done).Give his and her voting record and show they are full of it""Many people on social media"" is really often just like a few hundred or a few thousand people. That's completely insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Twitter distorts the actual views of the voters and public. There's always been this year that Bernie supporters won't vote Biden thus losing him the election. There's no evidence that that will actually happened or happened with Clinton. \s\s**More Clinton supporters voted for McCain in 2008 than Bernie voters voted for Trump in 2016**\s\sIt's always around 5-10 that swing to the other party.I posted this on r/politics but it’s worth posting here. \s\sIf Trump gets re-elected it is checkmate. Foreign entities will forever be bidding to elect our leaders bad faith actors with infinite resources will be able to consume infinite political clout the Supreme Court will be 7-2 for the next 40 years and deciding on thousands of issues important to all of us our stature around the world will be irreparable for at least a generation the climate will continue to be plundered voting rights trampled civil rights trampled and income inequality will be frozen at levels worse than when there were robber barons. \s\sConservatives tend to vote for the most conservative candidate. But there is one subset of progressives who will sit out if there isn’t a perfect candidate. The stakes are so high right now we cannot afford to not step up for Joe. Hell do it for Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She is 89 years old and can’t retire without ruining the country if Trump is re-elected.  If you’re sitting out elections because Joe is too moderate then kids in cages is as much on you as it is on Trump.[removed]To be honest I think it's an incredibly small minority of progressives criticizing the Biden/Harris ticket it's just unfortunate that that minority is incredibly loudI wish Bernie were President but he's a great guy with a ton of good ideas. Hopefully we can all learn from him!I don’t think we should allow any Newsweek links here since the racist op-ed about Kamala.Advice from Grandma:\s\sBefore you make a comment READ the article.Thanks grannyI get that these aircraft are for places outside of Afghanistan to focus military aircraft resources within the country but how small is our air force that we can't do both things? And other nato nations aren't able to do it?Nobody can do all things at all time.\s\sOur military is massive but it doesn't cover the whole world at all times.We COULD- but keep in mind that flying also means maintenance. \s\sIt is likely cheaper to contract private airlines to fly them out of friendly countries than to also fly them via military transport.flekker2 does it really matter?  The point is to get those people out as fast as humanly possible right?  Granted that we don't know as much as the president knows there must be very good reasons why he chose to do it this way.  After all he IS the president right?   \s Why can't you trust that Biden knows best?\s\sSo what is your problem with this seriously?

He was happy to get a high quality education during peace time about the military but refused to serve during war time.|What's ironic is that DT avoided the military because he's rich and he faked an aliment.\s\sIn a vacuum that wouldn't affect my opinion of him. \s\sHowever in reality it does make the McCain comments and the failing to even acknowledge the Russian bounties that much more egregious.This is pretty important. \s\sThe military is the last resort if the GOP is unwilling to rein in Trump so it's good to know they too are turning away from his authoritarian regime.Don't get comfortable.\s\s> nearly half of respondents (49.9 percent) had an unfavorable view of the president\s\sThat isn't even half.> Similarly almost 74 percent of those surveyed disagreed with Trump’s suggestion that active-duty military personnel should be used to respond to civil unrest in American cities including the ongoing racial equality protests. Only about 22 percent supported the president’s idea.\s\sThe most reassuring two sentences in the entire article.It's been clear for years now that the very idea of democracy itself has become a partisan issue in the United States which is incredibly dangerous for our republic.\s\sAt the same time it's extremely reassuring to see that the military's devotion to the principle of civilian rule and its aversion to getting involved in politics is still strong. That is one of the pillars of our democracy and it's a major reason why we have avoided the outright slide into genuine authoritarianism which has happened to so many countries where the military did not have the same apolitical culture. I'm still worried about the erosion of that principle over the long term as the GOP's commitment to authoritarianism becomes more and more normalized but it's good to see these numbers at this current critical moment.As military your first and foremost duty is to the people and the constitution. Following orders from any leadership comes second and pales in comparison.\s\sI urge all military members that might read this to remember that your oath binds you to the constitution first and your leadership second. The constitution is for the people not the government.\s\sBeyond that it is not the job of any military member to enforce law and order. The job of the military is to defend the country and constitution from all enemies foriegn and domestic. Protesters wanting equality guaranteed them by the constitution you swore to uphold do not constitute a domestic threat to any except those against the constitution.Marine voting for Biden.Thank you for your service!This was before his national guard speech where he specifically called out Trump using the military as a prop It will be interesting if that any effect.Off the point but...\s\s\sDraft Dodger trump: “*You know if you’re young and in this era and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam we have our own Vietnam — it’s called the dating game*” Trump said to Stern in a 1993 interview. “*Dating is like being in Vietnam. You’re the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam.*”Truly the words of an honest to god scientifically and psychologically true to form narcissist. He 100% cannot for the life of him relate to anyone else's experiences. He only knows what goes on behind his own eyeballs.Maybe they dont want to be picked off by Russian funded bounty hunters.That's what ultimately did it for me and many fellow SMs. \s\sThe fact that Trump couldn't even say that he'd consider maybe denouncing Putin if it turned out to be true but instead claimed he never saw the report started blaming us and ranting about China was very telling and incredibly disturbing. \s\sOn top of the Cpt Crozier fiasco and the callous disregard for our lives many in the military are beginning to damn Trump.Joe Biden had a son who was deployed to Afghanistan. He understands. Trump comes from a long line of draft dodgers and war profiteers. Trump has said he thinks people who join the military are stupid.If you're tired of just hanging out on base stateside Joe Biden is definitely your candidate.Who knew pissing on gold star families and tweeting the shrugging emjoi when you find out about bounties would have a negative effect?[deleted]IIRC in 2016 in the military at the officer level it was split evenly between democrats and republicans. But amongst the lower levels there were many more Republicans.The US military is quite diverse though people from Southern states are over-represented and northeastern states under-represented compared to those area’s population totals. Notably the Army is Blacker than America and the Marines are more Latino than the country as a whole.\s\s\shttps://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-militaryThis is genuinely surprising. I keep seeing all these specific groups that Trump is losing ground with the military suburban women the elderly yet his approval has remained nearly constant. \s\sEither the change in approval levels of these groups is being overstated or he is gaining ground with other groups.He's been gaining ground with people who still consider themselves Republicans. He's probably been gaining with white evangelicals too since their leaders have always been all-in on fascism as long as they get taxpayer money with no strings.Or it's a crap poll\s\s>Like most studies where participation is voluntary the poll’s sample is subject to self-selection bias.Yes! Let’s try to win vets. Become the party of patriotismDisclaimer: I do not speak for the Air Force or the DoD :)\s\sI am in the military and voting for Biden.  Liberal military members do exist but we are a pretty rare breed.  The fear tactic is always out there that we are doomed if a Democrat is our Commander in Chief and that they will cut us to nothing but honestly I would rather have no job for the right reason than one for the wrong.  My oath was to the people of the United States to protect them. (Well I am not warrior as I ride a desk)i almost cant believe how good these numbers are for biden but at the same time if i was on active duty and my honor and safety were determined by the whims of Donald Trump I would be absolutely terrifiedMaybe insulting General Mattis wasn’t smart? It’s an insult to troops to expect their respect. He’s done nothing to earn itHe said he was smarter than the Generals during the 2016 campaign and wound up elected anyway. So like most things if insulting Generals hasn't hurt him in the past it's hard to imagine it would now.“The bottom line is that in 2020 Trump can’t be claiming to have overwhelming support in the military.”\s\s...but he still will. Because he's a liarGood news but...\s\sEvery time we get good news let’s use that energy to do some work. Make a phone call for a person running in a tight senate race or donate some money\s\sWe can’t take these polls too seriously. They won’t come true without workSlipping with the troops but in the FiveThirtyEight polls Biden is losing a bit of ground everywhere and Trump is gaining ground. Nothing major yet but it’s beginning to concern me. You would think there would be at least one battle ground state were Biden is solidifying his lead only solace is the pattern in Nebraska 2nd district — could be temporary momentumIt’s ironic that so many paint Dems as weak when in reality dems are more willing to work politically instead of militarily.Dems were also in charge when we won WWI WWII Korea Bosnia Haiti Kosovo LibyaGood we may need them to remove Trump from power when when he refused to give up power.I am Active Duty and posted something similar before to what I am about to say. Disclaimer: I am an Independent voting for Biden in this election.  \s\sOne of the big Democratic talking points is defense cuts. In other words the Democratic candidate is perceived as a threat to your quality of life. You see this a lot with the far left candidates like Bernie Sanders and AOC.  This impacts not only traditional budgeting items like training and equipment but also your pay check. During Bush/Trump we were looking at 3-5% pay increases every year where as with Obama we were getting around 1-2%. \s\sA lot of the younger service members could care less about anything else. They don't care about civil rights reproductive rights 2A laws whatever. They are the very definition of a single issue voter. In this case support for the military which tends to be a Republican trait. \s\sSo what changed the past 4 years? John McCain James Mattis John Kelly H.R. McMasters Alexander Vindman and the list goes on. You can only publicly shit on so many major high profile members of the military before people start to turn. Yes we are loyal to our POTUS but not before each other. Not to mention finding out that Russia has been (probably) paying terrorist bounties to kill our troops and seemingly nothing being done to stop it. \s\sSo what trends do I see internally? I see a lot of regret from people who voted for Trump in 2016. I see a lot of people who intend to vote for Biden in 2020 and vote him out in 2024. It has turned into a referendum about Trump's leadership and nothing else.Trump is the bone spur Covid King. Biden supports our Troops and has dealt with a son in the military. Trump Jr. has never even had a real job. And Eric is as his aunt has said dumb as a rock.Maybe somebody told the troops that Trump keeps taking credit for benefits Obama got for them. And then there’s Tri-Care for life that Clinton got passed. Democrats have always supported the troops. Republicans throw a few extra dollars into the appropriations bills while giving the bulk of military spending increases to defense contractors.*This post was originally done by /u/victorvictor1.

In fact the reason his grandfather immigrated to America was to avoid military serviceSorry I just posted the same information before I saw this. It was from a different user but looks word for word the same.So damning.Any soldiers or front line military service member that votes for Trump is voting for a person too much of a fucking coward to confront Russia on why there is a “scalp” bonus for killing American Soldiers.Huge. I’ve worked with military guys. I told my wife it’s like working with 20 Trumps. It’s awful. Seeing that this is changing is welcome news.Its a shame that a large majority of us have to vote via the mail. Hope commands are advising people on how to receive their ballots and send them in on time.From what I understand—anecdotally anyway—Trump isn't very popular with the military; rather he's popular with armchair veterans.At least to my eye Trump has been THE most disrespectful president to our troops ever.    \s\sFirst he said he ""likes people that don't get captured"". There's a reason the POW-MIA flag is often flown prominently second only to the US flag itself and it isn't because POWs are failures or bad soldiers. They've sacrificed more than almost anyone else for this country and deserve a president who respects them.   \s   \sSecond he attacked a gold star family.   \s    \sThird he stated he knew more about ISIS than the generals even though at the time he was just a candidate and the generals had years of experience dealing with international affairs and conflict.    \s   \sFourth he either intentionally ignored the report of bounties on our own soldiers or has an administration so incompetent that the criticial information never reached his desk.   \s  \sFifth he's let the coronavirus run rampant despite many of our veterans being older and thus higher risk.   \s  \sSixth his enabling of white supremacy and nativism is actually quite anti-military because a sizable proportion of the military is made up of minorities (significantly more than their proportion in the whole population). While non white Americans sacrifice for this country Trump signals to them that the country isn't for them.   \s\sSeventh General Mattis was one of the few qualified people in his cabinet (as shown by the 98-1 confirmation vote) and Trump couldn't get along with him because he wasn't a sychophant.The whole narrative about republicans being friends to the military is as old as time. I was told this when I joined back in the early 90s. \s\sBut the evidence says otherwise.[removed]/r/JoeBiden does not feature links to NYPost.com.\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/JoeBiden) if you have any questions or concerns.*Never understood why anyone would vote to make any Republican since Reagan cut their benefits.I think one major factor is we tend to get higher pay raises by Republican Presidents at least lately.The former 4 star General Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis described the current president as a threat to our constitution by turning Americans against one another. He wasn’t lying. The person that has been lying the entire time to the American people for the past 4 years is the current president of the United States.Biden actually cares that Putin paid bounties to the Taliban to kill U.S. troops.

I hope so. If it’s true.When you call troops who were KIA or wounded “losers” the military is going to hate you. I’m surprised they haven’t turned on him after the Russian bounty system bombshell.Figured Trump was eating his own face by making increasing odds of military votes not getting counted.  \s\s&#x200B;\s\sBut it seems treating the military budget as his own slush fund for border wall Mexico was supposed to pay for didn't sit well with some.  \s\sStill boggles my mind that Bounty gate didn't convert more away from Trump.  \s\s&#x200B;\s\sBut I guess your whole home town voting R is tough to break with.A bunch of Trumpanzees will claim fake news but just remind them of the footage of him vs McCain and him vs Khanyep.

A lot of us myself including didn't like either candidate. I didn't vote Trump but I understood why others did. I do think this time is different though. I hope in the coming years the Republican party will grow from this. I'd like to feel good about them again.Not sarcastic just really stupid.… … …\s\sIs this real? It's not April 1st is it???'s Hmm.His go-to is ""It was just a joke bro!"" like he's President Logan Paul. I remember back in 2016 he spent 3 days claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS and his surrogates ran around trying to justify it and he repeated the claim multiple times in all seriousness before claiming it was all a joke.What it seems like happened was that he had a thinking out loud moment and was trying to ask if we can science up a way to put whatever is in disinfectant in a medicine. \s\sHonestly that would’ve been pretty easy to clear up. Still a moronic question but he could’ve just said “yeah I messed up my bad”. The fact that he feels the need to outright lie to cover it up is very not like a leader and will blow up in his face.The fact that he’s so starved of attention that he just bullshits out loud about whatever imbecilic idea he had is infuriating. \s\sJust let the experts give an update then get off the stage and go back to work. Our country has tens of millions unemployed and everyone is stuck at home until we can get enough testing underway to prevent a new flare up. \s\sGet back to work Trump so we can as well.We moderates have gotta stop dicking around with the others. They progressives have come together and we don't have the luxury of time.\s\sPete can't get the minority or progressive vote.\s\sAmy can't get the minority or progressive vote.\s\sWarren can't make up the ground needed with moderates and minorities and Bloomberg is a waste of time.\s\sThere's one clear choice. Joe. Moderates better get their shit together and get behind him or we will lose 2020.Supporters of other candidates that you named are saying the same thing so we need to be careful who we direct that to because we need one another. \s\sAfter Nevada someone will drop out and there’s strong rumors of a Bloomberg ad blitz that is 100% negative of Bernie.. we gotta stay positive and remember who and what we support.This article hits the spot. All moderates and even the DNC agree Sanders will lose to Trump in november. \s\sThe major problem is all moderate candidates enjoy double digit support and nobody wants to be the first one to drop out.We really really need the moderate wing of the party (including the moderate Democratic presidential candidates) to come together and plot a path forward. Dividing the moderate vote like this won’t help beat Sanders which will cause Trump to get another four years.A lot of this comes down to a quirk of the math. In many cases it may hurt Sanders more to have more moderate candidates in the race; *if* they can hit the viability threshold.\s\sTake CA. If Sanders gets 30% of the vote in a district Biden gets 20% and everyone else clusters at 14% Sanders gets 30/50 or 60% of that district’s delegates with only 30% of the vote. If say Buttigeg and Warren get one point more to  15% then Sanders would get 30/80 or 37%. It’s really hard to game out how this will work out but it’s very plausible that Sanders could come away with a majority of delegates with only 25-30% of the vote.Take action: **[Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/Df5krhPG6z)**.\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

Where's the unconstitutionality of executing sitting elected officials?This lady shouldn't be trusted to manage an Arby's let alone a federal congressional district.And she was allowed to become a Congresswoman.... YikesDamn no wonder AOC felt that she's unsafe...Republicans....Lock her up!This plus other GOP goons insisting on bringing firearms onto the floor of Congress should be deeply unsettling for any reasonable adult.What a horrible Qunt !

This sort of sectionalism reminds me terribly of the 1850s.Pre civil war and reminds me of Nazi Germany!!!It's sectionalism within the state of PA that he's going after in my opinion. Divide and conquer.I get flashes of the articles of confederation-era.He thinks of it as a patchwork of little fiefdoms and small businesses he can extort for support and/or cash like a fat mafia don walking down the street on market day.He thinks of the world as sycophants to worship him suckers to fleece and enemies to be crushed.This should run trumps chances for Pennsylvania right into the ground.Let’s hope so!!!\s\s🙏[deleted]What an idiot. Please continue to alienate the electorate of a state who’s votes you desperately need. We’d love you to. More votes for Joe.I will be voting for Governor Wolf when he comes up for reelection. This year I voted for our county's commissioner  who is a medical doctor who ordered our county's shutdown pretty early in this mess. I believe strongly these actions saved lives. I dont have reports to back me up.\s\sI am hoping the Republicans and Trump are not able to interfere with our state's election. Normally I would have 100% confidence in PA elections. I try to stay calm; deep breaths  positive thoughts. \s\sI think this ploy of his is not to make us Biden or Wolf afraid. It's directed at the red middle of Pennsylvania to terrify them into voting for trump. To galvanize them. I don't live in those parts. I don't know if it will be effective.🙏What a great way to win Pennsylvania to threaten their fundingYeah he should keep it up and issue similar threats to other rust belt states. Go for it Donny!Yeah that's how you win PA voters threaten to take away their federal aid!He is and always has been his own worst enemy n he loves demonstrating daily!!!How bad y’all think this’ll hurt him?Probably at least a little. Us Pennsylvanians love Governor Wolf for the most part. I think his approval rating is in the high 60sI won't let you play with my trucks because you didn't give me your legos waaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!I’m taking my ball and we won’t play with my balls anymore!!!\s\s🤣\s\sOr we won’t have Trump to kick around anymore...\s\sTricky Dick!!!Honestly I know it’s a meaningless statement but this to me should be an impeachable offense. Merely talking like this. Let alone the fact Trump has actually done things like this to Puerto Rico CA and WA already.Spot on!!!With Trump in office this is the new normal.\s\sI will celebrate so hard with my friends here in Norway in one week when you expel this cancer out of the White House.So will we!!!How can he possibly get away with directly telling voters in Pennsylvania that he’s gonna hang Pennsylvania out to dry in a crisis?Cuz he’s an idiot!!!\s\s🤷‍♂️And they cheered.He gets away with it because the Republicans control the Senate and now they control the Supreme Court.\s\sTldr; the US federal government has given white privileged men more power since the Constitution.\s\sIn the 2018 midterm elections many positions were won by Democrats.  The majority of the House of Representatives was Republican the first two years of Trump's presidency. Democrats won the House majority back in the 2018 elections but it has limited powers. \s\sFor example the House can impeach a President but cannot actually remove him from from office without sufficient support from the Senate. The House doesn't have hearings on nor confirm Supreme Court Justices. The House can start bills but the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell decides what will actually be brought to the floor in the Senate. The House can't force the Senate to even discuss their bills on the Senate floor.\s\sThis is (part of) why the over-representation of a minority of the US population in the Senate causes our federal government to so frequently go against the country's majority population. \s\sHeres an example of how the deck is stacked.  The Senate over represents the people of Wyoming while under representing the people of NY and CA. There are two representatives in the Senate per State regardless of the population of the state. The structure of our federal government from my point of view makes it easier for politicians to be brought to heel by corporate interests with tons of money to lobby bribe blackmail or otherwise unduly influence those who are supposed to serve their constituents. \s\sThe original constitution denied black men status as human beings. They were property so of course when founders wrote ""We the People"" it discriminated against black people. Worse than that southern states got to count their slave population towards their representation in the federal government. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise\s\sOur constitution has been updated as we progress. The GOP can't stop progress. Lately I've been calling it the Obstructionist Party because from my perspective they use most of their power to stand in the way of positive progress and change for our country.\s\sLet's  hope the GOP doesn't win the House back while Trump or a Trumpette is president. Even if Biden wins 2020 technically Trump can win the presidency for a second term at a later date such as 2024. Which is why a bulletproof case needs to be made that he is ineligible to become president for a second term.\s\sI hope the Democratic party faces an opposing party which regains true integrity so that our country's progress can be discussed respectfully and sanely between reasonable and compassionate duly elected servants of the people.This is why he was impeached in the first place.Yesssssss!!!Every single pennsylvanian should see this fucking story100%!!!Petulant ignorant child.Among so many other psychological problems!!!U didnt help cheat...what a pos. His ppl love itDoes he want to lose Pennsylvania?\s\sBecause this is how you lose Pennsylvania.He just can’t get out of his own way!!! Damn Democratic Governors!!! They don’t appreciate me!!! Whaaaaaaaaas!!!I will never ever understand why Trump didn't commit to rebuilding infrastructure. Even in his most corrupt self-interest ways he could have funneled a lot of taxpayer money into companies owned either by his family or by his allies by giving them construction contracts.\s\sNo he couldn't even do the most common move committed by corrupt politicians worldwide while looking good by rebuilding the country.\s\sNo he is simply too damn stupid to even be properly corrupt.It’s really quite baffling. \s\sTrump honestly had a great path to victory if he just showed some semblance of competency throughout his presidency. His base is vigorously behind him so as long as he did some decent work in office (i.e. infrastructure) and didn’t fuck things up too much (spoiler alert: he did) he would have sailed to a second term. \s\sInstead he was too selfish to put the nation in front of himself and here we are today.Yeah I don't get it either. It would have checked every political box for him all with easy buy-in. And at current interest rates infrastructure improvements would pay for themselves -- not even factoring in the jobs the savings to unemployment programs and Medicare etc.infrastructure spending == government spending == SOCIALISM so GOP is against it. \s\sYou only get a pass if it's government spending on 'defense' ie a giant ineffective wall to keep brown people outHe could literally still do this. With record rates of unemployment government infrastructure projects would be super popular you’d think. But he won’t. He’s too busy tweeting law and order.Making me pine for the days of Haliburton my mancan't spend money if you don't either go into debt or raise taxes\s\sthe GOP is very straightforward less taxes and less debt.\s\swhats really baffling is that if he would have simply passed the tax cuts then went golfing and kept his mouth shut he would have gotten reelected.  He could have worked a few days and then mailed it in for 8 years.It’s because he’s too lazy to actually do anything. The reason he passed tax cuts is because the house GOP did all the work. But doesn’t have the discipline to actually set a priority put a team together and get the work done.Because guys like Mitch and Paul Ryan would rather solidify old standard conservative  ideas like healthcare/abortion/military/tax cuts.\s\sThe problem is with infrastructure is that it isn't a sexy issue - because it's something everyone agrees on.Because he decided that Democrats were his foil so working with them was out of the question.Right? It would have been so easy and they could have made bank doing legitimate work that we need but I guess it isn’t fun unless it hurts peopleBecause there's only so much money available. There's only so many trillions you can go into debt before Wall Street will say ""Tilt. This is too far; this is going to collapse the country before not after we're dead"" and stop you.  \s  \sAll of that has to go -- has to -- to tax cuts for corporations and the .1 and .01% percent rich. There's none left for infrastructure. It's not Trump it's the Republican party which sent him the bills to sign. They couldn't stop themselves from doing that if they wanted to; they'd die first.They kept pulling back because one of Trump's weekly scandals and/or goofs to the point that ""Infrastructure Week"" became a running gag.There have been some infrastructure projects like the DOT gift for a special senator in KY from his wife: [https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/17/chao-mcconnell-transportation-kentucky-086343](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/17/chao-mcconnell-transportation-kentucky-086343)\s\sProbably best not to brag about that one.He talked about how he had never slept in DC before that experience is an important word that he told Melania when he became president that “this is great” and called John Bolton an idiot. Which is in the same vein as his Tulsa “speech”. No actual message. Just bizarre rambling and rants and stories about walking down a ramp.Spoiler alert: Re-election is Trump's **only** priority.The ironic thing is that “experience” on the executive stage is Biden’s strong pointLol what was great was having everyone rent whole floors of his DC hotel to get access to him.  \s\sThat’s something else SDNY is investigating.  Loads of money for empty rooms.I'll take ""prioritizing not being prosecuted for his crimes until the statute of limitations passes"" for $200 Alex.>Hannity asked Trump: “If you hear in 131 days from now at some point in the night or early morning: ‘We can now project Donald J. Trump has been re-elected the 45th president of the United States’—let’s talk. What’s at stake in this election as you compare and contrast and\s\s># What is one of your top priority items for a second term?”\s\s>A completely stumped Trump decided to riff and wound up rambling off a mess of words that were tailor-made for the viral comedic sensation Sara Cooper’s next lip-synch video.\s\s>#“Well one of the things that will be really great you know the word experience is still good” Trump said while turning to the audience. “I always say talent is more important than experience. I’ve always said that. But the word experience is a very important word. It’s an a very important meaning.”\s\s\s\s>The president continued to answer the question about some of the important issues he’d conquer during a second term if given the chance.\s\s>I never did this before. I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington I think 17 times. All of a sudden I’m president of the United States. You know the story. I’m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our first lady and I say ‘This is great'” Trump said. “But I didn’t know very many people in Washington it wasn’t my thing. I was from Manhattan from New York. Now I know everybody and I have great people in the administration.”\s\s>Without taking a breath Trump then pivoted to his former national security adviser John Bolton whose new book about his time in the White House has gotten under the president’s skin—but also who has nothing to do with the question Hannity asked.\s\s>“You make some mistakes. Like you know an idiot like Bolton. The only thing he wanted to do was drop bombs on everybody. You don’t have to drop bombs on everybody. You don’t have to kill people” Trump said.\s\s>Hannity finally jumped in to help by continuing Trump’s focus on Bolton and left the topic of a second term as though the question was never asked.\s\s>With the ongoing pandemic the economy in shambles and even some of Trump’s pet issues like immigration it’s hard to fathom why he drifted the way he did. But thankfully for the president Hannity was there to hold his hand and guide him through an interview that short on substance but long on propaganda.Yet Biden's the one who can't string a sentence together.\s\s>“Well one of the things that will be really great you know the word experience is still good” Trump said while turning to the audience. “I always say talent is more important than experience. I’ve always said that. But the word experience is a very important word. It’s an a very important meaning.”\s\s\s#""[T]he word experience is a very important word""?\s\s All I can say is that somehow Trump has lost both talent AND experience while in office.  Something I would have previously thought was impossible for a President to do.The last two sentences are perfect. This perfectly captured how I feelHe basically says he wasn’t qualified when he was elected and somehow knowing more people in Washington and all the dumpster fires he’s started count as experience.Not even sowing discord?  That's his thing how could he forget something he does every time he opens his mouth unless it's to shove food in it .When Sean Hannity asked him what he would prioritize in a 2nd term:\s\s*“Well one of the things that will be really great you know the word experience is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I’ve always said that. But the word experience is a very important word. It’s a very important meaning. I never did this before — I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington I think 17 times all of the sudden I’m the president of the United States.

Now I know everybody. And I have great people in the administration. You make some mistakes like you know an idiot like Bolton all he wanted to do is drop bombs on everybody. You don’t have to drop bombs on everybody. You don’t have to kill people.”*\s\sTrump also complained that Biden cannot string two sentences together.Because for Trump it was never about *doing* something in the first place. It was always about the pursuit of power as an end in itself.He had a two hour rally in Tulsa where he failed to talk about a single policy or even provide any sort of vision for the next 4 years. \s\sSay what you will about his 2016 campaign...he at least lied about general vision-y stuff like ""Draining the Swamp"".Sure he can. He talks about that one thing all the time. Himself.It's because even he knows that he shouldn't be President. He's always known.\s\sHe's never bothered to hide his dislike for the job from the expression on his face when he learned he won & his daily schedule to behaving as if he's just another FOX News viewer & giving interview answers like this one.\s\sFrom the very beginning this whole thing was a vanity project to grift the populist base of the GOP. But that went off the rails when he won & now his ego & cowardice won't let him shut it down & walk away.\s\sThe only thing I just can't fathom anymore is how any sane person can see/hear the things he continues to say & do & truly believe that he's a good president deserving of re-election.>The only thing I just can't fathom anymore is how any **sane** person can see/hear the things he continues to say & do & truly believe that he's a good president deserving of re-election.\s\sThat's the thing though...anyone who still thinks he deserves another term is missing a few screws. No actual sane person can look at the last 4 years (e.g. his handling of the pandemic race relations the national deficit etc.) and think he's well equipped to stay in office.Jesus Christ he’s so god damn stupid and anyone who still support him needs to jump off a cliffFull interview for the curious Hannity's ""2nd term priorities"" question is at the 36 minute mark: [https://youtu.be/m0YKf-caVuY?t=2160](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fm0YKf-caVuY%3Ft%3D2160%26fbclid%3DIwAR2u7t0YQBu4e5YHhQVQiWGo1MtkDkZOXkjM1HIZNa8w9HpZegHbtox02VY&h=AT31bYvKePpqHH80bQGv3rvHGDEo3h8cD7sogjVemvIpXbkFKE6heGFgRygJJZtaz3JgC49MsxrU4xnmZqz5mXjsjWuf9ORZOGwjKvJzsvfGOYLqmf0K8QeFAIE1q1rNgEdri7NM&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT2j57ObRynlDvL0FpHuXYIP1n0FKCNYtyZrfYgOG9xuM8T2YPdgOIgig820Zg9qOkZdKQtm-FRBmE65ngAudcmYU_ic2Dp1id8dypg-OALZJhRGafq1DdijPprqOavdfoiCXjKaRu4TAxQNuZnLnvT0-WuE2w414pKl0pEnBIOEIg)\s\sIMHO it looks like Hannity just gave up on Trump actually answering the question and switched to a question about Bolton.I could think of one thing he'd prioritize.himselfThe most softball ass question and he couldn’t do it lmao. Just say “the wall” or some other dumb shit instead of going on a Grandpa Simpson style ramble.GolfHe's spent the last three years trying to undo everything Obama did so hopefully if he's re-elected he'll spend the next four years trying to undo everything Trump has done.trump's entire program: More CRIMINALITY to destroy the US Constitution.Every action of Trump's first term has been motivated either by personal greed/corruption or getting himself elected for a second term.  If he actually got a second term I would expect more of them same - all actions motivated by either personal greed/corruption or trying to get the Twenty-Second Amendment removed so that he could run for a third term.*Well I think that uh. Me staying out of jail. Uh we will biggly the corruption up to the next level.*Thank god Joe is starting to campaign on policy specifics. Like those get the point of ""orange man bad"" across without needing to say it.

He has NO concern for America nor Americans.I made it through about a minute then I just couldn't anymore.\s\sI feel stupider just for listening to him that long.I can...Putin.I thought destroying America would be top of his listWe've got a broken water main. Blocked stormwater drain systems. Roads cracked and buckled.  The worst bridges in the region.  We have millions of unemployed people who need jobs so there! The physical health as the financial crisis can benefit of all. Just what's the issue? Will they name the bridges and roads after Trump?! Vote Blue! We're not going anywhere until the crisis ends let's fix it.I'm beginning to think as much as I don't want him to get away with all this crap that offering Trump and his immediate family immunity from prosecution might be the best way out of this mess. He only cares about himself and maybe his family so we could still go after the rest of the criminals in his administration but the only 2 reasons Trump wants to remain President are his ego and to stay out of prison. The presidency has become so miserable for him I'm sure he'd be able to take the hit to his ego to just be done with it all after Biden beats him but the prospect of going to prison will make him try to stay in power and cause a really messy situation this winter. I of course want to see him dragged out of the Whitehouse in handcuffs but if that happens there will be widespread violence in the streets and an even bigger mess for Biden to clean up.Give him immunity from known crimes and prosecute to hell for everything elseThe poll also shows that 2/3 of voters side with the protestors.[deleted]So there’s at least some percentage that are Trump supporters but also protest supporters? What the hell is wrong with them?!Phew *reuters* with this?\s\sWear it like armor and get ready to run up the score.Exactly let’s get a new high score and flatten the Republican Party in November.

Still gotta get those votes!Run up the score!!I think the disastrous pandering like the church stunt that alienated all but his core base may make him the only republican in history to lose votes during a situation of racial tension.[deleted]Who cares vote!

Get out there and Vote you Beautiful sons of bitches!It's not enough! MORE!!!!!!!!!!!16% need to wake the fuck up and realize they have to vote. Those 37%...well they need to wake up from their almost 4 year long comaNot that it means much but the Betting Odds sites flipped from Trump to Biden today. (47.4% Biden - 46.2% Trump) Up until this point I think the sense was this was 2020 going to be a repeat of 2016 but I think as people see the real contrast between Trump and Biden its becoming a bit clearer that 2020 is going to be a lot different.  The Democratic Base is now fired up.If only popular vote counted. Keep working everyone!It’s that remaining 16% we have to work on.Anyone know why Real Clear Politics doesn't post Reuters/Ipsos polls?16% what Giant Meteor?Getting Trump out of office is the most important thing that I’ll ever doWe gotta do what we can to make these numbers even more favorable and get everyone out to vote. No complacency baby!Serious question how do we ensure all of our votes count? I suspect the GOP will try their best to suppress voteshttp://fairfight.com for starters. There are others.Run up the score baby! Let’s push it to over 50%!Seems like a bunch of reluctant Trump supporters moving into the ""don't know"" category who will almost certainly find an excuse to move right back to him by November. \s\sI'd like to see Biden actually start gaining and holding an outright majority >50% consistently in polls.The fact that anyone no matter how good can be polled against Trump and not exceed 50% is depressing.Trump will try every fraud possibleUnless Biden is 50% + margin of error + 1 vote this shit is a wide open race.Great news! Now more than ever we need to protect citizens voting rights and ensure that every vote is getting counted and not suppressed in critical swing states -- Highly encourage folks to donate to orgs like http://fairfight.combe careful. this means there is 16% who can swing it one way or the other. 5% would go to the 3rd party that leaves 11% for one way or the other.Hopefully this sticks because GOP will do all they can to steal this for him.I worry that if unrest continues throughout the summer Trump's law and order message may resonate with at least some portion of voters who otherwise don't like him. The protesting is fine but if they continue to degenerate into violence wanton destruction and looting support will whither away from Middle America. I've been an advocate for police reforms for many years yet the other night when I watched my city being destroyed and looted on live TV for 3 hours I was clued in to how the anti-protesters feel. I am able to put it all in perspective but that gut feeling you get when you see your city being looted is very strong. I can understand why some people ride with it. The looting has to end or we're all in big trouble.Take action: **[Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/Df5krhPG6z)**.\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

There is a money machine working every since 11/4/20 to give the WH and congress back to Republicans and you can bet they don't ever take a day off.Totally. I’m super worried about 2022. Trump Party clownish though it is could realistically take the House back. I don’t feel like the Democrats are in such a “great” position at all. Gerrymandering and an antidemocratic Senate are still huge roadblocks. Not to mention GOP voter suppression in every state they control and the electoral college still existing.> What’s good for Biden and the Democrats in the short run is potentially  disastrous for America over the longer term. One of its two major  parties is centered on a big lie that threatens to blow up the nation  figuratively if not literally. \s\sThe conclusion articulates exactly how I feel and why I believe that however much people want to forget about Trump and trumpism... they cannot afford to. In my opinion the Trump cult represents a vastly greater threat to American democracy than any foreign power ever has.The only good thing is that his cult is only entirely devoted to him. And he is an old man who doesn't strike me as healthy in the least.\s\sShould he croak his cult will fragment. Not break apart but significantly fragmentnot as dangerous as Reaganomics was and definitely not even close to the damage gops has done by dividing USA and supporting traitors of insurrectionI had the misfortune of stumbling upon this speech and I know it's probably a massive over reaction but I have rarely felt so threatened and terrified at a video before it's gotten to the point that I will never feel truly safe as long as he and his supporters are aroundI completely agree. Donald Trump is a threat to America and the world for as long as he lives.4 years of Biden and 4 years of Harris after. Bye bye gopsStupid goddamn headline Donald Trump is a fucking worldender there are 500 THOUSAND American dead and counting all the Einsteins said Trump capturing the 2016 nomination was such good news for Hillary and after Four years of Fascism holding the United fucking States of America hostage with a half million dead these assholes are doing this same bullshit again.

It was a flex to reveal just how deep their claws are in.

Trump was the perfect puppet for Puppetmaster Putin.Why why why is this not all the news is talking about. People got played. They should be told this.[deleted]this essentially validates the steele dossier and that was all over the news.i don’t think anyone believes these documents are authentic. eg https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/15/blockbuster-document-purportedly-kremlin-raises-lots-questions-about-itself/I feel fairly sure that one day information will come out showing that the Kremlin had a big hand in the Brexit vote.  It's absolutely in Russia's interest to have other nations divided and squabbling and led by idiots.The UK has swept that info under the carpet and tried to downplay the Kremlin influence in Brexit several times and fairly successfully.  It's quite against British political culture to admit they've been played so instead they'll cover it up and that's probably because the Kremlin likely had their hand in both Labour and UKIP pockets.Putin knew that the only way him and the Russian Mob could get their money back from trump was to get him in the WH and blackmail him….pay up orange boy or your dirty secrets will be spilledPutin is burning his asset now that he deems him no longer useful. \s\sPutin has some predictions for 2024 and they ain't Trump>The paper does not name Hillary Clinton Trump’s 2016 rival. It does suggest employing media resources to undermine leading US political figures.  \sThere are paragraphs on how Russia might insert “media viruses” into American public life which could become self-sustaining and self-replicating. These would alter mass consciousness especially in certain groups it says.\s\sWhile most Americans (and our leaders) are playing 2d chess they are playing at least 3d chess.\s\sThis reminded me of [an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/10/foreign-spies-watching-and-probably-targeting-fox-news-channel/) I read a while back warning that foreign spies are likely targeting Fox News.I imagine it's not much as a true ""leak"" as an intentional release of information meant both as Putin burning his tangerine asset that has outlived its usefulness as well as a gift of appeasement to Biden.So either the Mueller investigation was blocked from the truth on coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia or was running interference for any worthwhile investigation on the actual crimes committed.Does anyone know why this story wasn't picked up by any other major news sources? The claims here are even bigger than Cambridge Analytica and no one is talking about itWell  we (the U.S.) have been doing the same damn thing for well over a hundred years......it was bound to happen to us.A ""leak"" from the Kremlin? I don't want to rain on this parade and trust me no one would rather want this story to be true than me but I have to say that until I actually see the infamous Peepee Tapes I am going to take an ""I'll believe it when I see it"" position. Still fingers crossed!Putin is clever but not that clever. I suspect these were made recently and purposefully leaked. They serves his purpose of creating more division and taking advantage of the current situation. Putin is not a master planner. He is KGB. They excel at taking advantage of situations and creating chaos to create more opportunities. \s\sWas there interference? No doubt. But was it some grandmaster plan? No. That I think likely gives him too much credit. Which is another thing he wants. \s\sThe timing gives it all away.They were definitely purposefully leaked but they're accurate.\s\sThis is just Putin and his intelligence group gloating over their success now that trump has outlived his usefulness.Suspect based on what? Nothing? Cool.Not a master planner ? \sThey meticulously plan operations and then execute while having to think on their feet. Also it was decades ago that he was top dog at KGB/FSB  his deviousness would only have improved. \s\sKGB/FSB have a reputation and even without that the average agent in any agencies worldwide that send people undercover is exceptional\s\sWe had a grand total of one such agent in my whole extended fam and when he appeared to just be in the insurance business as far as we knew we still regarded him as being a kind of savant for how quickly he absorbed vast amounts of information and made intricate plansyou obviously didn't read the article.Fuck all you commies with your fake ass newsPutin is president of University!You guys really believe this shit? You gotta wake up sleep joe is Putin’s wet dream. I and one other thing…. Trump wonPlease break that down on how that works for you I’m dying to hear how Biden is Putin’s puppet not Donny.Russia and China is the one mostly suffered from trump  don't be stupidI love how everyone thinks that Russia aided Trumps victory. Maybe it's the fact that people shared the same values as Trump. Let's see remember when Hilary could barely fill a small gym of supporters that camera crews had to angle it just right to make it seem like the room was full when a third party takes a pic and it shows about 250 people in a capacity of about 1000. While on the other hand Trump could easily have on average 10k to 25k supporters at a rally.lmao imagine being so fucking stupid that you think because a bunch of fuckwits show up to his rally it means he won.....like holy fuck bro. are you just gonna be butthurt trump lost forever?The rational is perfectly clear: Trump is guilty and Barr's job is to cover it all up and make it go away.I think we can probably ad lib this memo: ""all hail our our supreme leader the holy one Donald J. Trump for he is our moral and spiritual leader and can do no wrong. P.S. In case the the press or media finds this memo: the libs are brainwashed sheep!""Whatever its 2020. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Subpoena Subpoena Subpoena!I find it hard to believe that Putin didn't make Trump delete them.According to the article there were some meetings where no American (interpreters) were present.  And I assume that Trump or someone in his brood had a hand in finalizing meeting minutes. Under Bush Jr. he had many records of his father’s time at the CIA sealed. So a president has the ability to seal or hide the location of records but I don’t think they get to destroy them.There was at least one meeting where only Putin Trump and two interpreters were present and the notes were destroyed after.Yeah well trump wasn't exactly tech-savvy.Forgot to empty the recycle binYour sure Putin would care? It only hurts Trump.Doesn't do any good if it keeps it to himselfHoly shit maybe these transcripts will be used in the impeachment. I can't imagine Putin and Trump didn't talk about the insurrection.Trump's an idiot. Putin is former KGB. If Putin doesn't want the world to know they didn't talk about it on anything that has a transcript. If Putin wants the world to know they spoke about it explicitly and extensively.That would be great but highly unlikely. I’m sure that the agencies don’t want to public to know those nitty gritty detailsThese transcripts are 100% irrelevant to the impeachment. There is a single impeachment article - you can't randomly bring in evidence completely unrelated to the incitement of insurrection.\s\se: All anybody seems to be doing here is sticking their fingers in their ears shouting ""LALALALALA.""\s\sMy words are merely facts about the fundamental process of an impeachment trial.\s\sIf those transcripts happen to hold evidence of an impeachable offense (which I wouldn't doubt) that's all well and good - but it would have to be a *brand new unrelated* impeachment. Trump's 3rd.Putin isn’t that dumb. You think he would say anything incriminating on record? Nah. Trump is dumb enough tho. And The whole Russia thing is just not gonna work anymore. We had a whole ass impeachment trial and dragging it up again is just gonna hurt those who want to impeach him.Does he? I bet there was a lot of material destroyed.Biden wont release since that would be poor form. \s\sBut guess what???\s\sFOIA bitches!Well? If there is anything bad publish them.Release the kraken!“Vlad tell me again how you take out your enemies. Could I borrow some of that poison you use? Can I mix it in a Diet Coke?

I’ve got this amazing new paint scheme for Air Force 1. You should fly with me sometime.....”Trump's entire administration was using encrypted software that destroys all messages and leaves no trace (while trying hard to create back-channels to Moscow) - there isn't going to be anything incriminating on those phone calls!  They knew not to commit crimes on tape (or in writing).\s\sYet every time Reddit gets their hopes up....how can you possibly know that?We fought for years for the ability to export strong encryption. This is how it is supposed to work.Wait why wouldn’t these phone calls be the first thing the fascists wiped after leaving office?What happens when NOTHING comes of this yet the Democrats run the entire country?Texas Louisiana Florida etc. still run by the GOP.There are court dates already on the docket next Wednesday and Thursday so the plea deal could be made public as soon as the 21st and more indictments could drop on Manafort as soon as the 23rd. Mueller does like to drop indictments on Fridays so we can all raise a glass to him. What I am saying is Paul Manafort may have a terrible horrible no good very bad week is what I am trying to say.Do you think they'd be able to indict Manafort on new testimony from Gates so quickly? I suspect they'd try to find more evidence -- documents bank statements recordings or other witnesses -- to corroborate Gate's statements given that the defense will almost surely try to claim that Gates was coerced into any testimony against Manafort. I am no prosecutor but I see Gate's testimony as (a) a way to know about further crimes / evidence and (b) sufficient means to obtain warrants for that evidence.\s\s(Edit: on re-reading your comment it doesn't look like you said they could incorporate his testimony quickly.  So hopefully this is a bad month rather than a bad week for Manafort and well the rest of the campaign.)In related news water is wet and shit stinksAdd it to the list of things that will just be ignored.You are not wrongThe Republicans would not exist without voter suppressionI'd just like to say it's been a pleasure shitposting with you all over the years and I look forward to doing it again with the next despot.Same will probably have to retire this name!

Making token signs of gratitude towards the soldiers is guaranteed to make conservatives and moderates think highly of you but he refuses to attend military commemorative services or even say anything nice about any US solider currently serving duty or not. The death of a public figure basically requires everyone to say nice things about them but he has never said anything nice about John McCain after he died and then refused to sing any hymns at George Bush Sr.'s funeral and spent the whole time sitting there with a miserable pouting expression.

This needs to be paid for my the GOP and Abbot’s campaign funds.I didn't fund the wall I funded to fix the gd power grid but they don't ask permission to misappropriate your money.I'm confused  did Trump lose Texas?  What's the point of this?Trump didn't lose Texas. GOP is looking for evidence of wide-scale fraud in counties that voted blue to justify their bullshit ""election integrity"" laws. They just can't fathom Texas having that many non-republicans in it. GOP can't handle the truth. And everyone's paying for it monetarily and sociallyThe GOP should fund this if they are so sure that there is election fraud; not Texas taxpayers who needs in other areas. \s\s“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”Someone should sue Greg Abbott for aborting Texas' voting integrity.Oh joy.\s\sThat's what I wanted to be done with my money.I'm just surprised Cruz quit sucking trump's dick long enough to let Abbott have a shot at it.\s\sI mean - chain of command and all that.Republicans do not give a fuck about government spending when it's done purely to keep them in office. \s\ssmall government lolHow come billionaire trump is paying to find out Texas voted for him… again! Like we already know like he already got all the electoral votes! What a shite! Abbott is a brown-nosed lick-spittleTrump doesn't pay anyone for anything.So can we get him voted out already? JfkAs a Trump supporter I was ready to move on last November.  But noooooooo.  And now I’m thrown in as a proud qboy crazy.  The lawyers make everything difficult and expensive.  Very expensive.

There's got to be massive Republican fraud. \s\sIf we just extrapolate from the horrific mismanagement of the grid up to and including its preventable occurrence.We pay for everything.  And we have these guys spending it on this shit.  Everyone must vote!I’m pretty sure Bettencourt has FAbbott’s little greg firmly gripped under the desk. I mean look at FAbbott’s expression. He hasn’t received this much attention until he started gushing on trump100% Complete and utter bullshit that Texas will literally burn millions of dollars JUST so Abbott can fantasize about becoming President when we ALL know he has zero chance of becoming Vice President let alone President!!!Terrible action! Stop wating time looking at a lost election and look toward future elections.  Win with a positive message and plan. Pointing out what's wrong with the other party is not enough.Democrats cost the state more than [$3.5M](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/06/17/texas-tab-voter-id-lawsuits-more-35-million/) in their efforts to stop the state from requiring voter ID. If they're worried about the cost of an audit they might agree to stop opposing voter ID in court.How much did the state waste trying to overturn election results in OTHER STATES while the indicted AG was grandstanding? 🤔Just the other day you were on here lying about how this audit would be paid for by the GOP and not taxpayers and it would be an audit of every county. You are just a completely dishonest person who should be tagged with a ""I am a blatant liar"" flair so others know what you are and what you're about.Did you not read your own article?\s\s> While SB 14 was awaiting the pre-clearance decision Abbott sued the federal government in Texas v. Holder hoping a court would step in and speed up the process. That lawsuit cost taxpayers roughly $1.73 million about half the tab for all voter ID-related litigation according to the records from Paxton's office.\s\sSince half the overall cost of lawsuits here were initiated by Paxton I imagine you're equally upset at the GOP as you are Democrats. Right?This is all you do. It's not subtle that you're not a real account.Texan & True American  citizens don’t mind to donate money to support AUDIT 2020 ELECTION. Not to find out what happened & how bad .. LIE-CHEAT - CORRUPT. on 2020 Election & why Supreme Court did not pick the case? \s\sMost politicians owe each other a favor and had them in there pocket. Trump didn't owe anyone a favor so he ran the country the way it's supposed too be run the way our founding father's meant it be be run.

The goal of the dumbass Texas law was never to accomplish what was written in it.  It was done for the intention to be legally challenged all the way to the S.C. to allow Trump's and McConnel's ill-gotten court to overturn Roe.I actually think it's interesting legal maneuvering. If it bans abortions it's a win. If it is overturned and blocks courts from allowing third parties to sue others for legal breaches it's a win. Either way I expect the final decision to be pretty narrow or - depending on what the lower court rules - to be sent back or vacated.

It's no one's business who gets an abortion or why and government needs to stay out of it. Abortions have been justified as a constitutional right under the 4th amendment and its criminal to try and restrict it.

Can’t get an abortion tho!The question should be: what will their excuse be this summer when people die due to power outages in the summer heat.  Read [This article](https://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/texas-at-elevated-risk-of-summer-power-shortages-potential-outages-regulators-warn/2642319/) about how NERC is warning us about dangerous conditions this summer.  According to the report:\s\s> A report released Wednesday by the authority that \s> regulates electric reliability in North America warns \s> that Texas is at an “elevated risk” of energy \s> shortages and potential power outages this \s> summer...\s\s> In its 2021 “Summer Reliability Assessment” the \s> North American Electric Reliability Corporation \s> (NERC) said the Texas grid managed by ERCOT \s> should be able to supply enough power under \s> normal expected operating conditions.\s\s> But the report cautions that Texas is expected to \s> see above-normal temperatures this summer and a \s> higher risk of drought across much of the state \s> potentially increasing demand for power and putting \s> more strain on the grid.\s\sHere is the [report](https://www.nerc.com/news/Headlines%20DL/SRA%20Announcement%2026MAY21.pdf) released yesterday by NERC.Greedy Greg and Pilfering Paxton have a lot of explaining to do!  Instead of making sure that we *never* endure another crippling power outage by prioritizing legislation that matters or using the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) to sue the PUC or ERCOT the Attorney General of Texas is the only one with the power to sue these liability-exempt entities.  No all they seem to care about is continuing to turn Texas into a deregulated—except for the freedoms of women children disabled Texans our veterans and homeless populations—corrupt wasteland an authoritarian oligarchy and failed state. \s\sAccording to the WaPo’s investigation [As Texas Went Dark the State Paid Natural-Gas Companies to Go Offline: A program meant to reduce industrial electricity use during emergencies contributed to power plants not getting fuel during February’s freeze](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-texas-went-dark-the-state-paid-natural-gas-companies-to-go-offline-11620385201): \s\s> The Electric Reliability Council of Texas activated a \s> program that pays large industrial power users to \s> reduce their consumption during emergencies.

Ercot ordered them to \s> stay off for more than four days as gas prices \s> surged to extraordinary levels and some power \s> plants stopped producing electricity because they \s> couldn’t get enough fuel to function.\s> \s> \s> The estimated value of the program for the five days \s> of the blackout was about $2 billion—and \s> participants including oil-and-gas companies \s> earned a portion of that for turning themselves off \s> at Ercot’s behest.

I know of one specific wealthy neighborhood in that area ***never*** lost power or had their internet interrupted even though it is not on the same power grid as a Hospital or anything else deemed “critical infrastructure.”  Maybe Paxton lives in this neighborhood?  Even if he doesn’t why were there so many wealthy neighborhoods that were spared entirely from the deadly power outages not to mention the natural gas that was sent to homes instead of power plants especially in Plano?\s\sWhy is Paxton only suing [Griddy](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/01/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-griddy/) for violations of DTPA?\s\sAccording to Ken Paxton Attorney General of Texas’ [Con­sumer Rights](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-rights) page:\s\s> The primary tool the Office of the Attorney General \s> uses to protect Texas consumers is the Deceptive \s> Trade Practices Act (DTPA). \s\sPaxton had used this law in 2017 when according to reporting by the AP and others the [“Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed three lawsuits [in September of 2017] against businesses accused of price gouging during Hurricane Harvey.”](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-09-12/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-businesses-for-hurricane-harvey-price-gouging) According to this article:\s\s> Under Texas law businesses are not allowed to \s> charge excessive prices for essential goods such as \s> food medicine water and fuel during a declared \s> disaster.\s\sAs for Abbott it is odd that it just so happens the Governor has received $26 million in political contributions from the oil and gas industry (more than any other economic sector).  According to the AP [“Texas governor’s biggest donors: Energy industry that failed”](https://apnews.com/article/business-greg-abbott-energy-industry-weather-austin-e2fe851121e86c7399c6a01e051a8079).  \s\sThe Republicans in the Texas Legislator and the Lt. Governor Dan Patrick—who would instead hold a special session to bully transgender children than pass laws to fix our power grid—are also to blame for this and all other future catastrophes.  There is no excuse for their failure of leadership and dereliction of duty. Lives are on the line!  Texas remains at elevated risk of summer power outages as rising temperatures push our grid to the limit.  According to news reporting [“Texas at ‘Elevated Risk' of Summer Power Shortages Potential Outages Regulators Warn: NERC warned that the highest risk of forced power outages in Texas would likely be from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. the hours when demand typically peaks” ](https://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/texas-at-elevated-risk-of-summer-power-shortages-potential-outages-regulators-warn/2642319/).\s\sEvery last State Politician especially members of the GOP should be under federal investigation.  Moreover the useless and spineless members of the Texas GOP should be voted out in mass because the Texas legislature had an entire legislative session to get their act together and focus on solving this ongoing threat to the lives property and loss of income due to deceptive trade practices by targeting the following measures:\s\s•Ambitious market-driven energy efficiency programs;\s\s•Addressing energy poverty for low-income Texans;\s•Fully weatherizing state energy sources;\s\s•Resilient onsite energy at critical facilities like hospitals and water treatment plants;\s\s•Start investigations into the effects of climate change on the increased number of natural disasters Texas has faced and will continue to encounter by determining how to mitigate their impact on the lives of Texans;\s\sNot looking into solving the problems above would mean that the people we elected are corrupt and deserve to be voted out.  Overall I want every single member of the GOP to be investigated for blatant abuses of office including perhaps accepting bribes and illegally profiting off of their positions of power by purposefully failing to act in the best interests of Texans instead of their Lobbyists.I agree with all of this and I’ll even throw in; I don’t want Republicans at all to ever hold any kind of public office ever again in this country.Rename the power grid ""uterus"". They love regulating those..And do you trust ercot when they say they are ready for the summer??No. I don’t trust ERCOT at all!ERCOT just released a new press statement today talking about how they're going to respond to the predicted shortfalls power outages and heat deaths this summer:\s\s\s¯\\\_*(ツ)*\_/¯BuT gOvErNoR cUoMo FuDgEd ThE cOvId NuMbErS\s\sThey'll never realize that both statements can be true because \[in their eyes\] bad things are only bad when Democrats do themCorrect!  Additionally I am sure that many Texans died of COVID during the blackouts; they likely would not have died were it not for the storm.  Also the actual number of how many Texans contracted COVID during the storm because they had to seek shelter in crowded heating centers or stay with family or strangers that had heat we will probably never know.\s\sEdit: Clarity.Pfft…I mean compared to 52K COVID deaths.Touché!Here’s an idea: first person who dies because of power outagesone member of the ercot goes to jail for 10 years.

But they did track the spread of the virus in China and later in other countries **and warned that Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.**  \s>  \s>Taken together **the reports and warnings painted an early picture of a virus that showed the characteristics of a globe-encircling pandemic that could require governments to take swift actions to contain it.** But despite that constant flow of reporting Trump continued publicly and privately to play down the threat the virus posed to Americans. **Lawmakers too did not grapple with the virus in earnest until this month** as officials scrambled to keep citizens in their homes and hospitals braced for a surge in patients suffering from covid-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus.  \s>  \s>Intelligence agencies “have been warning on this since January” said a U.S. official who had access to intelligence reporting that was disseminated to members of Congress and their staffs as well as to officials in the Trump administration and who along with others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive information.  \s>  \s>**“Donald Trump may not have been expecting this but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it” this official said. “The system was blinking red.”**  \s>  \s>Spokespeople for the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment and a White House spokesman rebutted criticism of Trump’s response.  \s>  \s>“President Trump has taken historic aggressive measures to protect the health wealth and safety of the American people — and did so while the media and Democrats chose to only focus on the stupid politics of a sham illegitimate impeachment” Hogan Gidley said in a statement. “It’s more than disgusting despicable and disgraceful for cowardly unnamed sources to attempt to rewrite history — it’s a clear threat to this great country.”  \s>  \s>Public health experts have criticized China for being [slow to respond](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/spread-of-coronavirus-threatens-to-strain-us-china-relations-along-with-global-health-system/2020/02/03/14d52fea-469c-11ea-bc78-8a18f7afcee7_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_14&itid=lk_inline_manual_14) to the coronavirus outbreak which originated in Wuhan and have said precious time was lost in the effort to slow the spread. **At a White House briefing Friday Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said officials had been alerted to the initial reports of the virus by discussions that the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had with Chinese colleagues on Jan. 3.**  \s>  \s>**The warnings from U.S. intelligence agencies increased in volume toward the end of January and into early February said officials familiar with the reports. By then a majority of the intelligence reporting included in daily briefing papers and digests from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA was about covid-19 said officials who have read the reports.**  \s>  \s>The surge in warnings coincided with a move by Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) to sell dozens of stocks worth between $628033 and $1.72 million. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Burr was privy to virtually all of the highly classified reporting on the coronavirus. Burr issued a statement Friday defending his sell-off saying he sold based entirely on publicly available information and he [called for the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-richard-burr-r-nc-says-he-has-asked-senate-ethics-committee-for-review-of-his-stock-sales/2020/03/20/43861396-6ab8-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_17&itid=lk_inline_manual_17).  \s>  \s>**A key task for analysts during disease outbreaks is to determine whether foreign officials are trying to minimize the effects of an outbreak or take steps to hide a public health crisis according to current and former officials familiar with the process.**>At the State Department personnel had been nervously tracking early reports about the virus. **One official noted that it was discussed at a meeting in the third week of January around the time that cable traffic showed that U.S. diplomats in Wuhan were being brought home on chartered planes — a sign that the public health risk was significant. A colleague at the White House mentioned how concerned he was about the transmissibility of the virus.**  \s>  \s>“In January there was obviously a lot of chatter” the official said.  \s>  \s>**Inside the White House Trump’s advisers struggled to get him to take the virus seriously according to multiple officials with knowledge of meetings among those advisers and with the president.**  \s>  \s>**Azar couldn’t get through to Trump to speak with him about the virus until Jan. 18 according to two senior administration officials. When he reached Trump by phone the president interjected to ask about vaping and when flavored vaping products would be back on the market the senior administration officials said.**  \s>  \s>On Jan. 27 White House aides huddled with then-acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in his office trying to get senior officials to pay more attention to the virus according to people briefed on the meeting. Joe Grogan the head of the White House Domestic Policy Council argued that the administration needed to take the virus seriously or it could cost the president his reelection and that dealing with the virus was likely to dominate life in the United States for many months.  \s>  \s>Mulvaney then began convening more regular meetings. **In early briefings however officials said Trump was dismissive because he did not believe that the virus had spread widely throughout the United States.**   \s>  \s>By early February Grogan and others worried that there weren’t enough tests to determine the rate of infection according to people who spoke directly to Grogan. Other officials including Matthew Pottinger the president’s deputy national security adviser began calling for a more forceful response according to people briefed on White House meetings.  \s>  \s>**But Trump resisted and** [**continued to assure Americans**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/trump-coronavirus-timeline/?tid=lk_inline_manual_33&itid=lk_inline_manual_33) **that the coronavirus would never run rampant as it had in other countries.**  \s>  \s>**“I think it’s going to work out fine” Trump said on Feb. 19. “I think when we get into April in the warmer weather that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus.”**  \s>  \s>**“The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA” Trump tweeted five days later. “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”**  \s>  \s>**But earlier that month a senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services delivered a starkly different message to the Senate Intelligence Committee in a classified briefing that four U.S. officials said covered the coronavirus and its global health implications. The House Intelligence Committee received a similar briefing.**  \s>  \s>Robert Kadlec the assistant secretary for preparedness and response — who was joined by intelligence officials including from the CIA — told committee members that the virus posed a “serious” threat one of those officials said.  \s>  \s>Kadlec didn’t provide specific recommendations but he said that to get ahead of the virus and blunt its effects Americans would need to take actions that could disrupt their daily lives the official said. “It was very alarming.”  \s>  \s>**Trump’s insistence on the contrary seemed to rest in his relationship with China’s President Xi Jingping whom Trump believed was providing him with reliable information about how the virus was spreading in China despite reports from intelligence agencies that Chinese officials were not being candid about the true scale of the crisis.**  \s>  \s>Some of Trump’s advisers told him that Beijing was not providing accurate numbers of people who were infected or who had died according to administration officials. Rather than press China to be more forthcoming Trump publicly praised its response.  \s>  \s>“China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus” Trump tweeted Jan. 24. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular on behalf of the American People I want to thank President Xi!”  \s>  \s>**Some of Trump’s advisers encouraged him to be tougher on China over its decision not to allow teams from the CDC into the country administration officials said.**  \s>  \s>**In one February meeting the president said that if he struck a tougher tone against Xi the Chinese would be less willing to give the Americans information about how they were tackling the outbreak.**  \s>  \s>Trump on Feb. 3 banned foreigners who had been in China in the previous 14 days from entering the United States a step he often credits for helping to protect Americans against the virus. He has also said publicly that the Chinese weren’t honest about the effects of the virus. **But that travel ban wasn’t accompanied by additional significant steps to prepare for when the virus eventually infected people in the United States in great numbers.**  \s>  \s>As the disease spread beyond China U.S. spy agencies tracked outbreaks in Iran South Korea Taiwan Italy and elsewhere in Europe the officials familiar with those reports said. **The majority of the information came from public sources including news reports and official statements but a significant portion also came from classified intelligence sources. As new cases popped up the volume of reporting spiked.**  \s>  \s>As the first cases of infection were confirmed in the United States Trump continued to insist that [the risk to Americans was small](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/trump-coronavirus-timeline/?tid=lk_inline_manual_53&itid=lk_inline_manual_53).  \s>  \s>“I think the virus is going to be — it’s going to be fine” he said on Feb. 10.  \s>  \s>“We have a very small number of people in the country right now with it” he said four days later. “It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape.”  \s>  \s>**On Feb. 25 Nancy Messonnier a senior CDC official sounded perhaps the most significant public alarm to that point when she told reporters that the coronavirus was likely to spread within communities in the United States and that disruptions to daily life could be “severe.” Trump called Azar on his way back from a trip to India and complained that Messonnier was scaring the stock markets according to two senior administration officials.**  \s>  \s>Trump eventually changed his tone after being shown statistical models about the spread of the virus from other countries and hearing directly from Deborah Birx the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force as well as from chief executives last week rattled by a plunge in the stock market said people ­familiar with Trump’s conversations.  \s>  \s>But by then the signs pointing to a major outbreak in the United States were everywhere./r/MormonPolitics is a curated subreddit.  \s\sIn order not to get your comment removed please familiarize yourself with our rules on commenting before you participate:  \s\s     Be courteous to other users.  \s     Be substantive.  \s     Address the arguments not the person.  \s     Talk politics not faith. \s     Keep it clean.  \s\sIf you see a comment that violates any of these essential rules click the associated report link so mods can attend to it.\s\s\s*I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

Him saying we shouldn’t fact check his lies is CeNsOrShIp!If you're not doing anything wrong then you shouldn't be worried.\s\s(Wait I've heard this one before.....)Biased fact-checking that presents itself as unbiased fact-checking certainly is turning out to be censorship in practice.\s\sEDIT: Perfect example from this week [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/26/no-biden-did-not-confuse-george-w-bush-donald-trump/) is fact checking (and subsequently social media sites like Twitter/Facebook/YouTube are flagging) a viral video of Biden mixing up ""George"" (probably referring to Bush) and Donald Trump. The headline of the WaPo article definitively states ""No Biden did not confuse George W. Bush and Donald Trump"" but the contents of the article aren't nearly as strong arguing that 'Well perhaps he could have been referring to the name of the person asking the question he was answering.' The article quotes Biden as saying ""Four more years uh George"" when you don't have to listen closely to the video to hear a clear ""v"" sound ""Four more years **of** George"". And this would make zero sense if by ""George"" Biden was referring to the person asking the question. So its very clear to anyone that he stumbles over the name of his opponent but because someone at the Washington Post is deciding to stretch the imagination to play defense of Biden all the social media downstream get to pretend to be unbiased while slowing the spread of the video.>Well perhaps he could have been referring to the name of the person asking the question he was answering\s\sI mean it was the name of the person to whom he was talking.\s\sIf I was watching that interview live I would have 100% just assumed that ""George"" referred to George Lopez and that Biden was just tripping over words deciding how he wanted to say that four more years of Trump would be bad.\s\sThe idiots who take every word stumble from Biden as evidence that he's in some deep cognitive decline are the same idiots who thought Hillary was concealing some life-threatening disease that was going to take her within a year of the election.The word “Probably“ is doing a lot of lifting here.  Probably referring to George Bush is not the same as definitely.  Using probably to suggest he actually did is what was fact checked.  Who’s being dishonest here?  The “probably”guys.In response to your edit. Is that really the best argument you can come up with? Is your pool of examples of bias so small that you had to go with that one?Show me a credible 'biased fact check' on a conservative (fact checking being defined as a media platform fact checking content which is what Lee is talking about here not users)He is free to say whatever he wants.

They predicted a Hillary landslide victory consistantlyIt is super sad that the office of the president is a choice between two populist blowhardsPopulist seems to be the smear of choice for elitists who don't think the people matter. \s\sThere's a reason that these two electrify people into action who have given up on the political system. Until you address that there will be more and they will be increasingly loud and politically devastating (in very different ways). The person who next leads the movement Trump gathered has the potential to be every bit as fascistic but actually competent. That's scary as hell.Maybe that characterization is accurate.  But one of those blowhards took a wrecking ball to the GOP Establishment.  At some point our country’s commentariat needs to get serious about explaining the fundamentals that are driving support for both blowhards.  I’d prefer that my party grapple with those issues head on rather than get caught like deer in the headlights of the wrecking crane. \s\sAt the end of the day Joe Biden is clearly better-equipped to both speak to those concerns AND map a route that nudges us toward moderate bipartisan solutions.  I agree completely with Joe’s thesis that we need a healthy moderate wing of the GOP.  Running against Republicans as “the enemy” as HRC did was a disservice to the country.  \s\sI’m increasingly optimistic that Biden is going to be well-positioned to govern effectively if elected. I’m also confident that the country would benefit from a Sanders presidency primarily in the way that eventuality would finally force Congress to get serious about addressing ever-expanding executive power relative to the 3 branches of government.  \s\sIn any case be sad about crime in our cities shuttered shops along our smalltown main streets the crush of living month to month as so many of our citizens do our inability to create adequate fair immigration systems and penchant for demonizing immigrants instead of taking responsibility to fix the system the woeful state of American public education the exorbitant cost of health care the absurdity of our culture of tipping at restaurants."

They said we were all set if we got vaxxed?Basically almost everyone is going to get the virus this time around. Every positive test represents about 10 total in the field so this headline should have read “210000 new COVID cases”. The upside is that as fast as it races through it will run out of people to infect just as fast and will peter out.\s\sUntil a new variant comes along that is sufficiently different to evade our defenses both natural and vaccine-induced once again.\s\sThis Ferris wheel from Hell could be turning for a long time folks.Or herd immunityDelta burned through the UK hot and fast didn’t it?No surprise they were partying it up early this year.Shut it all down!No lolWell it's FloriduhDeSatan is a mass murderer.

Can't prove someone died from Corona if they don't have insurance to get tested POSTI thought only urgent cares can turn down people without insurance?Serious question though...... how the hell are they finding the resources to track patient insurance info? Any time I have been in hospital there is someone who comes around and collects info once you are in ER bed - just an administrator type person. I can’t imagine anyone in their right mind would expose themselves to all these sick people just to collect INSURANCE INFO. I would not classify that as “essential.” \s\sPlus seems like many of the patients who are going into hospitals are at the point they are VERY sick. You’re telling me they have someone walking around asking sedated patients on vents to hand over their insurance cards? The logistics just seem like a nightmare/impossible to me. Maybe I’m too naive. Idk.\s\sLastly what about people who are going to end up in the makeshift hospitals? How the hell do they determine billing for that?

The consistency of poor decisions is now normal and we aren't even surprised when we hear something like this even though it costs lives.\s\sThere is surprisingly little outrage about the incompetency of our leadership.

That's not rhetorical I honestly don't get it.Because someone needs to be blamed and it’s obviously not going to be their orange Jesus that they spent years worshiping and finding increasingly ridiculous apologies for and tied their entire identities into defending him.\s\sThere’s very little glamour in being just another poor scared shmuck stuck in a dead end retail job (or even worse getting laid off from that dead end retail job because of all this). \s\sIt feels a lot better to instead see yourself as the paladin of Christendom freedom america the constitution traditional values “the little guy” whatever the fuck. \s\sThere’s a ton of dumb scared bitter people out there and there are entire industries that have been peddling bullshit to them and stoking their fear of others while simultaneously feeding their egos for decades and they are really fucking good at it.This is insaneAs high as the demand is for N95 masks why wouldn't they just start production? Why do they need the government to tell them?The article makes it clear. The guy needed some commitment for orders so that he could spend the money necessary to open the shuttered plants. Instead they gave money to companies with no production line or experience.

That’s far too deep down the rabbit hole.The whole family belongs in jail.Who’s “we”?can somebody tell me who Erik prince isErik Dean Prince (born June 6 1969) is an American businessman former U.S. Navy SEAL officer and the founder of the private military company Blackwater USA now called Academi. He served as Blackwater's CEO until 2009 and as its chairman until its sale to a group of investors in 2010. Prince heads the private equity firm Frontier Resource Group and served as chairman of the Hong Kong-listed Frontier Services Group until 2021.Ukraine is a very important tactical target because it’s so close to Russia.There are a handful of countries that can make helicopter and jet engine parts that move so fast under tremendous pressure without melting or breaking into pieces. This is a know-how that’s worth billions of dollars. US UK France Russia and Ukraine are in this club. Turkey started making some of these parts but not all.Wow you think you know about a decent size portion of the corrupt people and then read more and more and realize your still just at the tip of the iceberg. The further you dig the thicker and heavier the dirt gets.This human seems like a real life Bond villainHe should be in a Turkish prisonRemember all those unmarked ""police""  that were shoving people into vans last summer? Effectively kidnapping them off the streets during protests like this is fucking China or something? \s\sYeah I'm fairly convinced this cunt and his blackwater goons were at the center of that. He was one degree of separation from the ex-president. Wouldn't have taken much and it's already proven that 45 was talking about shooting said protesters. Fascist bullshit.Nah those were just feds. Would’ve definitely taken a contract for those events if it came up though.This is a man show needs to be stopped. Doesn’t matter but he has to be stopped. He’s a menace to the world. A madman bent on power who believes he’s the Hand of God meant to restore the order and bring Christianity to the world…his bastardized version of his so-called Christianity. This makes him dangerous on so many levels. In addition the worst of the worst hire him to cleanup what they can’t because they are able to deflect the murders of civilians by stating they weren’t involved.How is this man allowed to walk free?Same reason Rumsfeld died of old age in comfort surrounded by friends and family.[deleted]One of the founders of blackstone and Devos’ brother.

Too damn many people voting.Yup all those pesky idiot republicansYeah no shit. And the GOP is still siding with the guy and not listening to science. No conspiracy here just fucking selfish people taking advantage of idiots. Been the playbook for decades.He could have been a uniter could have made millions on maga branded masks.

No clue about the rules just doing what he thinks will get the loudest applause from the home team.I don’t like DJT or his policies but had he come out swinging against COVID-19 he would’ve won re-election in a bipartisan landslide.What about the period between December and March. You had to be blind to not see China didnt have control of the situation. The virus had spread to other countries and the CDC sat on their hands and watched. Even touting themselves the situation was being handled and we should be more concerned of the flu season. Really interesting that this isnt mentioned. Everyone was in some sort of quarantined state during the period they are referencing- everyone was aware it was serious once we didn't allow attendance to entertainment events.>You had to be blind to not see China didnt have control of the situation\s\sChina literally clamped down on every piece of news they could about the virus. And don't forget trump removed our pandemic response team and our China team.Unfornatually the GOP is really the party of projection. The deep state makes so much more sense when you think it's the republican party. Big Corporations giving dumpsters of cash to republican congressmen to keep fossil fuels a monopoly on energy in America. All the Child Sex trafficking's rings within the catholic church and the boycotts pillars in the conservative party.Shut the fuck up with your partisan trafficking bullshit. It’s not a D or R issue you fucking tools. It’s a human problem. You’d all better wake up.Amen?! Don’t let the QAnon Trump-idolizing blowhards get you down !You're just as blind as republicansBe wary that it could be a framing to have a reason to arrest him and/or make a worse name for QAnon.

0,AmericanPolitics,IvankaForPrison,2,> Donald Trump’s expanding legal worries stemming from investigations in New York and Scotland have received much attention in recent months. But one Trump case in which his 2016 inauguration committee and the Trump Organization were accused of a million-dollar grift has been proceeding for almost two years without drawing much notice and this week a judge issued a major ruling indicating the case is likely heading to trial. And that could mean that Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. who have each been deposed in this civil case could end up on the stand and questioned about their involvement in an alleged brazen rip-off of nonprofit funds.Grifters.

For as many innocent people that are getting fucked by landlords there are also those that should be definitely be evicted.People are so desensitized to the destitute it'll just be a dystopic continuation of how it's been unfolding all along here (American). \s\sThere will be that wince of shame as the urban wealthy walk by vagrant children on their gentried main streets but nothing will ever be done. \s\sTheir tiny outstretched hands and pleas for aide will just become background noise that can't be overheard by the marching band that is Progress.Many churches actively help out across the country. Join a church or donate to one.

Look at the communists countries for various examples. Generally everyone had living space but it was of pretty low quality..\s\sMost people aren't going to lower their own quality of life in order to help out a small fraction of the population that is homeless.I cant speak for the UK but in California  theres no unoccupied homes but ofcourse plenty of homeless. 95% of homelessness in california is due to mental illness and heroin/fentanyl addiction(thanks china and mexico).

I thought it was understood that poverty is deadly that it kills slowly randomly and never the same way twice so to speak but it kills people all the same. And I don't know how much shutting down and sheltering in place will prove to be too much. I don't know at what point ""the cure"" will become ""worse than the disease."" But I thought everyone would easily agree that at some point we will have ""jumped out of the frying pan into the fire"" if we haven't already.\s\sIt's not monstrous to make these points. They're obvious. If one of us had stock with a billion-dollar ""market value"" and we made these obvious points they would still be obvious. Framing someone as a monster for stating the obvious even for stating it badly seems pretty monstrous though. It seems especially monstrous when a HuffPo writer does it for clicks.Send him to Wuhan with no maskWhy? That place is fine now. Send him to NY.I mean if people don't get back to work soon then you're going to have half or even 3/4 of the United States (and probably many other countries) unemployed. They'll be unable to pay rent/mortgage unable to buy groceries unable to pay for medical care unable to pay utilities.\s\sWe can't just hang out in our houses for the next year and hope that magic fairies grow and deliver food and keep everything in perfect working order...I'm growing my own food me and my roommates have bartered with other people to trade live stock and the food we are growing. We will survive even through winter if the isolation went that long. Plus there are diy solar panels you can make and we are and we are very lucky that we have a running river under the land we are on and if we didn't we have a plan in work to get water from a nearby river system. Has for a roof over our heads if we lose due to not being able to pay we know how to build things. The world worked for thousands of years with less. People survived with a lot less then what we have in modern times. It's called survival and bartering. Those who can't or won't do it obviously won't survive if you have to rely on the government for everything thing you might as well put visible chains on your feet.

Panama is not a good tax haven for US companies and investors BECAUSE OF the 2010 US-Panama trade promotion agreement. Specifically article 5 of the Tax Information Exchange Agreement clause in the bill quoted below: \s\s>The competent authority of the requested Party shall provide upon request by the competent authority of the requesting Party information for the purposes referred to in Article 1 of this Agreement. Such information shall be exchanged without regard to whether the requested Party needs such information for its own tax purposes or the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the requested Party if it had occurred in the territory of the requested Party.\s\sNot only that Mossack Fonseca's services would be included in that type of information request:\s\s>Each Party shall ensure that it has the authority for the purposes referred to in Article 1 of this Agreement and subject to Article 2 of this Agreement to obtain and provide through its competent authority and upon request:\s(a) information held by banks other financial institutions and any person including nominees and trustees acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity; and\s(b) information regarding the ownership of companies partnerships trusts foundations and other persons including…. ownership information on all such persons in an ownership chain; in the case of trusts information on settlors trustees and beneficiaries; and in the case of foundations information on founders members of the foundation council and beneficiaries.\s\sThis is why all of the big scandals named are outside of the US. Although there are 441 US clients of Mossack Fonseca they probably did not use Panama as a tax haven.\s\stl;dr this article is extremely misleading the US-Panama trade promotion agreement completely shut down the possibility of US investors using Panama as a tax haven. What we're really waiting for is a massive Cayman Islands data breach.[deleted]but he's lived long enough to be proven right and have a shot at real power and put his message front-and-centerNo knock raids should have been illegal from the get go.I'm not sure it ever was constitutional. There are sometimes legitimate reasons for no knock raids if the proper research and planning is done. If there is a credible threat that suspect is going to destroy evidence or get a weapon and shoot back then the police should be able to get a no knock warrant. The police and judges who grant these warrants have to make sure that the proper preparations are done so that they can avoid collateral damage though.That was painful to read. That poor family even if they get the justice they must so strongly desire it will never bring back their child. I really feel for them and their fight. Where is the hero to look after the little people... :(so as citizens can we just start no knock raiding police homes and killing their loved ones... Yep. Who are these sick jurors voting to acquit propping up the police state?maybe they're just scared the ~~gang~~ police will retaliate after the trialGood point... No way is an article by ""Policestateusa.com"" going to be bias.  I'm sure they gave all the proper facts in the case\s\s\sI mean it isn't like the jury might know more about the case than us.  Just because they at there and looked at all the evidence doesn't give them more of a right to make a decision on this than me.  I mean I read an article on Policestate.com.\s\s\sDamn jurors are SICK I tell you probably all ex cops\sJust showing off for the cameras?There's subtext missing here which is why a senator who is in town likely in his office would miss a vote. For some a Senate seat is simply a step on the way to a bigger office and a long record of votes can paint a candidate for office into an idealogical corner. It's better to miss votes and not be on the record so that later he can claim any position on an issue that he wants without a paper trail of votes to contradict him.\s\sIn Sanders' case he didn't care about his future viability as a candidate. He has very clear positions on the issues and he doesn't try to deny them. With Sanders what you see it what you get. The rest are all posturing. If it turned out that being a transvestite meant a sure win every one of them on that debate stage would be in a dress. Except Sanders.[deleted]Obama wasn't there a lot either and yet look where he is now lol.It's not like he has anything better to do.

People think it's an extreme opinion to believe we need to lock these assholes up but it's not. These guys are mob bosses and deserve to be locked up!The militarization of the police need to stop.  People really need to stand up against this.. they are carrying machine guns driving tanks and assault vehicles and doing shit like this at no sign of danger.    I hope they get the shit sued out of them and the officer(s) that made the choice to throw that grenade personally suffers.  >  People really need to stand up against this.\s\sPeople do.  And then they are slandered insulted and harrased for taking a stand not only by other people but by the media and the gov't as well.  \s\sPeople tend no to give a shit until the problem affects them DIRECTLY.  People will go ""aaaawwww that is sad"" then go about their not never thinking of it again but it is not their child in a coma.\s\sWe allow cops to play weekend warrior with military weaponry so this is what happens a lot... Unfortunately now we allow citizens to as well. This shit is epidemic and needs to stop cop and civilian. People who are frightened tend to think that cops having more weapons will make everyone safer. The reality is that once the equipment has been purchased it is often considered a political necessity to put it to use. \s\sKevlar vests flashbangs tear gas and many other products have a designated shelf life and are very expensive. When you have to throw them away unused at the end of that shelf life people might start asking why you were buying such things in the first place. \s\sFor example in 2012 Keene New Hampshire (pop. 25000) was granted a [Bearcat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Nash_Bearcat.jpg/1024px-Nash_Bearcat.jpg) armored police vehicle. The town had an average of .5 murders per year over the previous 4 years. How many years do you think that Bearcat will remain operational? What are they going to use it for in that town?\s\sThey will probably only use it a handful of times to execute minor drug raids like the one this woman suffered from (not that they need it but they *have* one right?) and then decommission it and order a new one. This scheme works great for military contractors and terribly for the taxpaying American citizens.\sSmart towns paint it red or yellow and transfer them to the fire department. A little work in the county shed and that bad boy is ready to tow a trailer filled with fire foam straight toward your worst nightmare. It's not even that use becomes a necessity after purchase. When it comes to the war on drugs use is conditional for sale. Much of this military equipment is sold to the police and funding given for drug enforcement on the condition of arrests which pushes cops to do these kinds of raids to keep the money coming in. From what I've seen on Reddit people who are frightened think a gun makes a good safety blanket.:(That is my actual expression at this moment.  What a horrible thing to happen.  I hope the family receives as much support as they need and the little boy survives without much permanent damage.Holy shit. I would own that municipality before that lawsuit was over and it still wouldn't make me feel any better or fix the boy's physical and emotional wounds. I would also file personal criminal charges against the on scene officer in charge. Even if they didn't stick it would be best on principle. They're saying the boy probably has brain damage too.  Kid's name kills me though; Bou Bou...c'mon. Fuck the Police!  This kind of policing belongs in Nazi Germany not the United States of America.  We are degenerating into madness and paranoia if we allow this to continue.We can all be comforted by the notion that each and every one of these cops will get the paid vacation they deserve.  Naw I'm just kidding I'm sure nothing will happen.\sI read this yesterday and it's still bothering me. I hope the boy is ok.Why are we not doing something? I'm sorry something smells fishy.\s\s>Every morning I have to face the reality that my son is fighting for his life. It’s not clear whether he’ll live or die. All of this to find a small amount of drugs?\s\sSwat teams are not deployed over a 'small' amount of drugs and they are most certainly never arbitrarily deployed.  The fact that the article is also written by the victim reeks of bias there is definitely more to the story we are not hearing.\s\sThat being said it is horrible that the Swat team did not use proper intelligence gathering to insure there were no civilian casualties and the officers involved should be held responsible.\s\s**Edit:**  It was biased the writer of this article did not tell the whole truth.  Read and see.\shttp://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/2014/05/29/toddler-injured-flash-grenade/9751475/\s\s**Edit 2:**  I do not have the article but I have been PM'd and told that there are articles that seem to say the sheriff may have been lying.  I'm not going all out to look for more articles but keep it in mind!To be fair there are multiple tales of cops no knock raiding the wrong house.I agree with both points - it's probably more than a ""small amount of drugs"" and the article's biased. However in a non-war zone officers have a duty to use basic caution before using aggressive tactics.\s\sIn this case in particular they should have had some reliable notion of who was in the house before storming in and tossing an explosive. It's that lack of caution (and the subsequent lack of accountability) that is really appalling.I feel the same way.  I sure hope that this is not the standard way they operate.  Certainly for a small amount of drugs I find it hard to believe that a bunch of cops heavily armed would need to just bust in like that unless the boyfriend was some Columbian drugloard who they chased into the house whil engaged in a gunfight.\s\sBut maybe things are different there than they are where I live (California).What do you mean the writer did not tell the whole truth?Glad I wasn't the first person to think this...Also cops are not supposed to rely on CIs (confidential informatants) for details instead of actually doing investigative work!  There is no excuse for these actions.  No Knock warrents served in the dead of night are a horrible idea.  How many times is someone going to get hurt because they think they are being robbed instead of raided?  How many times are officers going to use military style techniques when they aren't necessary?  An ounce of prevention right?  No excuse - none.  senseless shit over absolutely nothing. /r/atlantaWasn't this already posted and got a large number of comments on /r/news?[deleted]Militarized police are bad m'kay?The police need to be disarmed and demilitarized.  We're handing military grade gear to untrained idiots who have nothing more than a high school degree and who operate outside of the very laws that they swore to uphold.  Contact your state representatives and senators and urge them to direct budget appropriations away from your state police and redirect those funds toward education including post-secondary ed.  Attend public meetings of your city town township borough or village and advise your local commissioners council members and mayors to do the same.If you didn't want the cops to come to your house..maybe you shouldn't have had drugs in there.   It takes more than ""a little"" drugs to have the cops come calling. Besides people the source is far from reliable... So you're saying the baby had it coming?Hm. Since they had the wrong house and didn't notice toys in the yard I'm not sure it's reasonable to assume anything else they ""knew"" was accurate or even *real.*\s\sMaybe they didn't have any drugs.  How would the police know until they came in and searched?You're a real piece of work. You're on the right track.\s\shttp://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/2014/05/29/toddler-injured-flash-grenade/9751475/\s\sSuspect was arrested on scene.No it doesn't and that's the problem.  Regardless of whether you personally break the law or not you need to understand that the constant abandonment of the constitution and stripping of everyone's rights will not stop with those who are actually breaking the law.  In this instance and in dozens of incidents reported daily uneducated testosterone driven overarmed neanderthals are inflicting real harm on innocent citizens based on mere suspicion.How could a SWAT department raid a house without knowing whether the suspect was inside or that there were children present? If the police department has all the resources for a SWAT team with military grade weapons how on earth do they not have the resources to do proper surveillance on the house? I have a genuine respect for law enforcement except when blunders like this are made. This is unacceptable and something must be done. I'm going to start by calling the Habersham Sheriff's Office: (706) 839-0500 and the Corneliaga police department: (706) 778-858 and express my outrage and demand justice. The second thing I want to do is get the ACLU involved because the family's 4th amendment rights to protection from unreasonable search and seizure have been violated. \s\s**Edit**: also I'm going to call the DA's office to ask why they are giving no knock search warrants for residences that have children. Didn't Eisenhower have something to say about this back in the 50s?Every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed.\sThis world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants each serving a town of 60000 population. It is two fine fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.Ron Paul would frequently bring that up when talking about the military industrial complex. They are the people who profit from human suffering and death.They told me it was entitlements in the debates what do you mean it really isn't entitlements it is really the military-industrial complex and our politicians skimming off the top middle and bottom of the multi-trillion dollar trough of our hard earned money.

I'm sure that there are fringe assholes waiting in the wings to try and ruin the movement if it gets popular enough but out of the 150 or so people in my meeting there were only 1 or 2 I wouldn't want to sit close to on a bus.Sounds like 2008. Can't wait to see if the democrats payed attention to what happened to Ron Paul and if Bernie's supporters can avoid the same treatment.No one's supporters can control the media.Anyone But HilaryAnyone but a Republican you mean.\s\sHere's the problem;\s\sThey say they ""think the Vermont socialist can topple Hillary.""

Gray vetoed the bill.\s\sA corporation should not hold that kind of power.  Vincent Gray pussied out big time on this one. The irony escapes them apparently.No it doesn't.\sThe Walton family is the richest family in America for a reason.Truely a fitting story for /r/nottheonion[deleted]I think a lot of middle Americans just liked the fact that there was a guy running with a 'I don't give a fuck' attitude. Most of my friends feel disenfranchised from the political status quo. That's where Trump (and to a lesser degree Bernie) were able to rally the people. If the DNC would've dropped Hillary when they saw Bernie's growing support we would've had a different election. It wasn't only the way Sanders was treated by the DNC. Clinton supporters were all too ready to be dismissive of the ""BernieBros"" and assume all his supporters were either wide eyed and naive or that they hated Clinton for one of several excuses(sexist anti-Clinton anti-establishment etc.).\s\sSometimes my stepdaughter can be a real pain in my ass trying to argue until she gets her way. I need a set of earplugs like the DNC wears. And then if she gets pregnant in middle school I will just blame the rural white males.\s\sIt was like they wanted the Bernie crowd to go play in their room while Mommy and Daddy watch Dateline. I get there were plenty of assholes saying ignorant shit about Clinton in Bernie's camp. Maybe Bernie could have addressed it better. Then Bill Clinton goes on stage to bash the Bros for being sexist. No need to elaborate on that irony. I saw no effort by Clinton's campaign to court Bernie's supporters. Just a concession speech by Bernie because Trump scared him more than Clinton. She could have beat Trump handily if she had a plan to gain Bernie's supporters. They just wanted them out of the way. In the states she lost a simple matter of believing she gave more than zero fucks about them would have been enough to win. But it was pretty obvious they were written off. yep agree with you. DNC would much rather blame both white men and women than to realize they fucked up the election.Bernie may have had a chance.  We will never know. But I remember at the NH primary he won but the Republicans voted for FuckFace by a far larger margin than those who voted between Hillary Bernie and Martin.Sanders wasn't energizing ""the base"" he was energizing a small segment of it (far-left progressives) while losing to Clinton with other segments (racial minorities). He also wasn't attacked at all in the primary and Trump would've had a much better position to attack Sanders' negatives. When you talk about how Trump won on charisma it's hard to imagine Sanders doing any better. It's also important to note that Sanders' loss in the primary like Clinton's in the general was partly a result of having a strategy that didn't account well enough for the idiosyncrasies of the respective elections. ""DNC shenanigans"" didn't help Sanders but that doesn't mean he would've won in their absence.\s\sThat's the thing: in the end the only thing Sanders would've *definitely* done better than Clinton in the general is have a less-arrogant strategy one which doesn't take turnout for granted. The same however could be said of other candidates like Biden and Webb -- and both of them have more moderate appeal and fewer negatives. And back to my point about Sanders' failure in the primary turnout doesn't mean anything if you're just getting a 2 point loss in AZ instead of a 6 point loss. There's no evidence that he would've changed the result in the electoral college.Real answer to me is Tim Kaine did absolutely nothing for her campaign. No offense to Tim who is a standup guy. But Cory Booker would have invigorated the AA community Warren or Sanders would have brought together the liberals and youths. She failed to get the big ticket VP and the campaign fizzled.\s\sPence absolutely helped Trump get the rural vote and the win. If Trump picked Christie Hillary would have taken home a lot of those swing states.I think it just speaks more to a failed strategy than anything else. Pence was the pick to energize the rural vote. Kaine was the safe pick to try and hold Virginia which the Clinton campaign thought would be enough to swing the election.\s\sBoth picks were emblematic of the strategy their respective campaigns were using. Just one strategy worked and the other absolutely failed.\sIt largely comes down to the fact that Hillary and her campaign alienated instrumental constituencies and assumed they'd just fall in line. Well guess what those people never showed up to the polls. That or they were so offended by the antics of the DNC and Hillary this season that they actually voted for Trump. Imagine that? Taking a large chunk of potential democratic voters and handing them over to the republicans. It's possible some of them will never vote democrat again. That's how badly her her campaign and the dnc fucked this one up. \s\sNot only did they ostracize and ridiculed Bernie supporters--a very liberal core demographic she entirely ignored longstanding blue-collar democrats in crucial states that again were a core demographic of the democratic party. She then permitted identity politics and class tensions to fracture who remained. \s\sHer ho-hum VP pick was simply indicative of much larger problems. She never once attempted to placate a base that she was very obviously alienating. And the DNC did no favors by instrumenting what came to be perceived as a rigged primary in favor of a character already long-known to be highly divisive. \s\sTim Kaine = zero charismaAdd to this the theory that people just don't like her.  She should have realized that in 2008 when she lost the primaries to Obama.  I just hope she's done.  She needs to ""retire"" like Bill did.I think that in the end it really came down to salesmanship.  When I was an outside sales guy I had to attend a lot of sales classes and when I look at the two campaigns through that lens I see Clinton's campaign doing exactly the wrong thing to sell their candidate to the American people.\s\sSales like elections are driven by emotion.  You don't rack up big numbers by rote lists of your product's (read: candidate's) features and benefits.  You try to identify sources of ""pain"" in your prospect (read: the voting public) what is making them emotionally uncomfortable with their current vendor (read: the incumbent) to see if you can help them.  ""I see you're worried about X Y and Z.  I have solutions that will help you"" will almost always win out over ""My product can do A B C C1 C2 D E F G G1 G1a G1b G2 H..."" ad infinitum.\s\s(As an example years back I was in Best Buy looking to replace my GPS unit.  My old one was crapping out and anyway I was frustrated by a lot of little GUI issues: cramped screen unresponsive touch ugly graphics.  A salesperson came to me and started pointing out the features of each item on display without asking what I was looking for.  I was immediately attracted to a Garmin unit before he got to reciting its features.  Why?  Because the display had pleasing colors and it was big enough for my fat fingers.  The salesperson noticed my interest and launched into a list of features: bluetooth [at the time I didn't have a cell phone so I didn't need it] map updates [everyone offers those] good reliability in the city [I live nowhere near a dense urban center and would almost never notice that difference] etc.  His droning on almost made me put the unit down and go buy it online.  If it wasn't for the fact that I needed a new unit asap I'd have done just that to get away from this guy who only wanted to show me how smart he was.  I was making an emotional choice: I liked the colors on the Garmin unit better.  The salesman never tried to understand why I was buying.)\s\sIn sales you also learn the importance of an elevator pitch: a simple concentrated easy-to-understand statement of what you're about.  Something that appeals to the emotions addresses common frustrations among your target market.  It should be short and sweet a speech you'd be able to deliver on an elevator ride between floors.\s\sPut aside the racism/misogyny/double talk and look at it from a sales point of view.  Trump came out of the gate with a simple elevator pitch: our country seems to be going down the tubes and I'm here to do something about it (simple slogans like ""Make America great again"" help even if they're ultimately meaningless).  He identified the pain of a large swath of voters (note well: so did Sanders).  He said (truthfully of not) that he had solutions to relieve that pain.  The blunt simplicity of his messsage got directly to the heart of the peoples' feelings and so the Trump campaign was able to power through any roadblock set in their way by scandal.\s\sHillary had a very smart platform one that experts said was an objectively better model.  But the Clinton campaign didn't really have a strong simple elevator pitch.  She presented her plans with nuance and wonky detail.  While it showed she had more substance it was a difficult platform to present in a distilled form.  The lack of catchy phrases and slogans didn't help either: ""We're With Her"" says nothing about addressing anyone's perceived pain; it reeks of entitlement.  The ads I saw in upstate NY were never about how HRC was going to help the working class they were about how Trump was unfit to lead.  It was a campaign run almost entirely from the ""head"" and not the ""heart"" and so if failed to capture the fire of the electorate.\s\sI think the finger-pointing going on in the left is unproductive.  I voted for Hillary (wanted Sanders tho) because I truly believed her plan was progressive in the best way possible.  But her campaign did not deliver her message well at all and in the end that's what matters.  Bill was a phenomenal salesman and that's what made him so popular.  Trump might be a huckster (he's already showing how big of con he's pulled on ""his people"" with his list of cabinet appointees) but he knows how to close a deal.  Whether you're selling cars electronics equipment or a presidential candidate you need salesmanship and that's where the democratic machine fell down.\s\s**tl; dr**: HRC's 2016 campaign couldn't sell a dog a meat truck\s\sEDITs: minor spelling clarityWell said. The problem with the Clinton campaign from day one was that this was always supposed to have been a coronation. It was Hillary's turn and who is anyone else to deny it to her. From what I gathered Hillary Clinton lost control of the message as the election increasingly became a referendum on Donald Trump and the Clinton candidacy more and more became about that she was a warm body who wasn't Donald Trump.Hilary would have won if a combined total of only 56919 (0.87 %) republican votes would have voted democratic in Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin\s\sState	           | Dem Votes | Rep Votes | Difference | Shift Needed | Electoral Votes\s---|---|----|----|----|----\sPennsylvania | 2817409  | 2890633 |     73224 | 36612          | 20\sMichigan       | 2264807  | 2277914 |     13107 | 6553.5         | 16\sWisconsin     | 1383926  | 1411432 |     27506 | 13753          | 10\sTotal             |                  | 6579979 |                | 56919          | 46\s\s56919 / 6579979 = 0.87 %\s\sOr if 113838 more democrats voted. \s\sOr if 113838 of Johnson Stein or McMullin voters voted for democrats instead.\s\s[Data used from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_2016) \s\sOr 0.046 % out of 125 million total voters this year.\s\sAlso Florida could be considered instead of Pennsylvania. \s\sEDIT: added sentences about the 1.7%\s\sEDIT2: changed 1.7% to 113838This is amazing. \sI think it also really highlights that democrats really did not show up at the voting booths or voted 3rd party compared to previous years.

The fact that she had political baggage of her own definitely didn't help things.You could easily replace ""Clinton aides"" with ""Democrat voters"".The real problem was that the Hillary who gave the concession speech is the Hillary that I have seen develop as a politician over the past few decades. That same woman did not run for president. They convinced her that she needed to be more relatable so she did all those small venue things. Had she reached more voters and showed  who she really was I think she would have won. I know her to be an amazing woman. I don't know her personally but I've met her several times and heard her speak in person more times than I can count. She is an amazing committed person who truly had the best interests of all Americans in her heart. Somehow no one else knew that. Or if they did they didn't care. Maybe she should have problems to do a whole lot of things for a whole lot of people that she could never actually accomplished. That seems to be a rather effective strategy.If she had the best interests of Americans at heart she wouldn't have managed to become a multi millionaire by giving speeches. You can try and tell yourself that they just really wanted to hear what she had to say but at the end of the day they were de facto bribes. When you take a bribe you are immediately disenfranchising everyone who didn't give you one. Hillary only ran for her ego and her pocketbook. Her fucking motto was ""I'm with her"" how fucking egotistical could she have been? Go correct the record elsewhere.These are the vile creatures that need to be purged from the DNC. They're human dry rot.Historically it wouldve been more surprising if she won.  The fact that it was as close as it was speaks to Trumps weakness more than anything (I voted Trump)Still think voter ID is a good idea and has no connections to racism ?There's a video of a republican politician saying very blatantly voter ID laws are designed to suppress votes.\s\sThis has never even secretly been about vote suppression and racism it's been out in the open but our politics doesn't really punish racism too much.Working as intended.Perhaps it has a connection to population density instead\s\s[Alabama population density] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Alabama_population_map.png)\s\s[Counties with a DMV] (http://imgick.al.com/home/bama-media/width380/img/opinion/photo/18871679-large.jpg)Does no one in this thread realize that you can have a ballot mailed to you..?

Also interesting to note:\s> Collier said the Driver License Division which issues 1.2 million licenses a year is understaffed and has 103 vacant positions.

It's OK to make it DIFFICULT for blacks to vote in Alabamee just not impossible?In some defense of the state the counties that lost DMVs are also among the least densely populated in the state. \s\sIt's absolutely problem they're limiting their service but if the state were to reduce the number of DMVs these are the counties with the fewest number of people to start.It would be an entirely different story if the state didn't have a voter ID law. However republicans have been pushing voter ID laws for exactly this situation. They claim it's get rid of voter fraud which practically doesn't exist (dozens of cases out of 126 million votes cast) but the real reason is to keep poor people from voting.\s\sThis is simply phase 2 of their voter suppression plan.It's a bad situation but the author is applying a lot of "" racial spin"" on the closing of these ten offices.   The state is actually closing 45 offices altogether leaving only four offices open in major cities.  That disenfranchises a helluva lot of white voters as well not to mention being a major league pain in the ass.\s\sIt's pure government insanity to propose that a state with nearly five million people can use only four offices for their drivers license needs.\s\sI believe political games are being played by the ALEA folks to put pressure on the legislature.  The bureaucrats responsible should be FIRED immediately. \s\s> That disenfranchises a helluva lot of white voters as well not to mention being a major league pain in the ass.\s\sIt hits the poor the hardest which is entirely the intention of voter ID laws.

We have been capped for far to long at 1920's numbers. Term Limits are a BAD Idea especially if no protections against Lobbying are not in place first.My thing is ""If the Koch Brothers Sheldon Adelson Robert Mercer Steve Wynn and Rupert Murdoch want it its must be bad for the working poor and the shrinking middle class""Talk about a conflict of interest.  We need to depend on those most adversely effected by this proposal which is in the country's best interest to vote against their personal interests.  Not soon enough.It's a terrible idea and it's a cop-out to avoid the real issues of incumbency protection.  If we had public funding of elections independent nonpartisan redistricting and strong public access journalism we could make sure incumbents win fairly if they do win without an undue advantage over challengers.  But people who do a good job in Congress and have the support of their constituents legitimately *should* stay on the job and develop experience including an experienced staff.  They can do much more effective long term work.  I've lived in a district with a member of Congress who served 20 years and did an amazing job and much of his effectiveness developed over time.  Forcing all elected legislators to serve for a short time just empowers lobbyists and wealthy donors who do get to stick around and that's probably why some Republicans like this idea.that's a ridiculous pile of centralized authority and money you are asking for when its easier to just pass term limits\s\syea let's do the term limitsI don't necessarily disagree about it being a terrible idea but I don't agree with it either yet. My concern is areas where serious issues go without representation because of a homogeneous population. For example non-Christians in the Bible belt. Although as I type this I realize a similar candidate would still likely win in areas like that if there was a term limit so maybe I need to spend more time polishing this thought.If I'm hiring a plumber mechanic doctor or lawyer I'm likely to prefer the person with more experience all other things being equal.

Trump consistently draws numbers much higher than that.But not in Salt Lake City. I think that was the point.He's backed out multiple times before what's news worthy this time?A debate between Trump and a Democrat on a Republican network.  The DNC would not let Sanders debate outside of the party's established primary process.  This isn't unreasonable to expect the candidate to win nomination before representing the party in outside debates.  After all the convention is where the patry's platform and message is finalized.[deleted]What have you done lately? Sanders is one of the most important people in North America. He's got the potential to lead a nation. Just saying.Trolling is done best with one sentence.Trump has nothing to gain by debating Sanders. Hillary is hugely ahead in delegates for the nomination and Sanders will never see the ballot in November so why bother to vividly contrast his opinions against Trump's? Sanders is most useful to Trump in his attacks in Hillary. \s\sEdit:  Here's an article explaining why Sanders will never see the ballot in November.  I am sure as hell not a fan of Trump *OR* Hillary  the Democratic Nomination system is rigged against Sanders.\s\s""*A casual observer of politics may wonder: how is that possible? After all heading into yesterday’s contests Senator Sanders has won nearly half of the primaries and caucuses held to date: of the 20 contests held so far Sanders has won eight while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D-NY) has 12.\sYet Senator Sanders trails by a more than two-to-one margin in the delegate count: of the 2383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination Secretary Clinton has amassed 1130 delegates while Sanders stands at 499.\sSo what’s going on here?\sThe DNC doesn’t allocate delegates by simply heeding the will of the voters. Instead they calculate their tallies from a combination of “pledged delegates” which are earned from the actual votes of real people and “unpledged delegates” better known as “superdelegates.”*\s\s\shttps://medium.com/america-rising-pac/the-undemocratic-democratic-primary-6f0a4e3d0976#.imw2o22qv\s Maybe he is just practicing his signature?Writing a letter with all of his thoughts to the people who love him. \s\sI wonder who will win this round of the screw daddy's will change it on his deathbed and steal the others inheritance or how they'll beat screwing an unborn nephew and brothers widow out of it's healthcare coverage and any money to It's mother will be topped.Taking every play out of the tin pot dictator's handbook.seriously lmao.  what kind of person pretends to not be sick and takes a photo op signing nothing?

Remember the Bible stunt at least no person was hurt in this “scene “.Well they forced out the protestors used tear gas iirc emptied them out before they had to leave the generals disavvowed it and so did the pastor.Maybe he's forgotten how to scribble?Yet more proof that anybody who didn't vote for Hillary in 2016 because ""she's too fake"" is a special mix of stupid and gullible.I didn't vote for her because she's deceptive.  I didn't vote for Trump for the same reasons.  I'll abstain my vote this year because I don't vote for evil even if it is lesser.  Get rid of the first past the post system once and for all.You still ringing that bell? Bit pointless at this stage.Here he is signing blank paper and telling people they'll get 10k on eBay... Lol.\s\shttps://youtu.be/W__2X0Cac1ESelling them to pay for the hospital bills.I looked into last month or so. Trump signatures can be had for much much less.

After Big Business fills in the bill it'll go straight to the Congress for a speedy rush-vote already with the president's signature.

He’s such a fucking lying asshole.\s\sI hope the photos he took of Ivanka nude as a child come to light.

Notice the doctor said "" I was TOLD President TrumpVirus has covid19...""

According to a Trump family friend Trump’s father Fred Trump Sr. insisted on working even after his Alzheimer’s disease advanced in the 1990s. “To retire is to expire!” Fred Sr. would say. The friend said that as Fred Sr.’s disease worsened––he once came down the stairs wearing three neckties––the family created a system so that Fred could think he was still running the Trump Organization. **Every day Fred Sr. would go to the office in Brooklyn and they would give him blank papers to sort through and sign.** The phone on Fred’s desk was set up so that it could only dial out to his secretary. “Fred pretended to work” the family friend said. \s\sHistory repeating itself.Doctor asked him to draw a clock face.God that website is awfulImpeached Trump is all theatrical and shuns work that will benefit AmericansHe is just precious.  Whenever he leaves office everyone is going to miss all the antics.Whatever would give you that impression?\s\sI would miss him exactly as much as I miss having a migraine.People that are unintelligent assume everyone is as smart as they are. This is how intelligent people identify the dumbest person in the room.[deleted]LOL Kool-ade must be real puckery to prepare regressives for all that ass kissing.Not as good as Joe Biden having notes on what reporter to call on.Sounds like they are scrapping the bottom to find this crap.The bottom is pretending he's president.And still the Greatest President EVER! MAGA!He’s half-dead 🤔Yeah greatest .... inherited 5% unemployment from a Democrat and blew it  to 9% .... inherited 28 trillion dollar debt (Obama increased it from 18 to 28 in 8 years) from a Democrat and blew it to 38 trillion in less than 4 years ... took decisions that resulted in more than 200000 Americans dying.\s\s... and you say Greatest President ever ... I guess we all know what you have been smokingPlease repatriate.He's the greatest GASPER of O2 ever!!!! Bigly gulper!!! Best struggling inhaler in history.... Everyone's saying what a tremendous compromised breather I am!!!!!I seem to remember our current President campaign on this with shovel ready jobs and they never appeared  congress  ( at the time democratic)  filled the bill will tons of pork barrel spending. until the bastards in congress are removed ( from both parties) and replaced with people that are not out to fill their own pockets infrastructure will crumble and pork will continueThat's gonna be the case for 99% of the shit he's suggesting. Remember when Obamacare was supposed to be free universal health care? Yeah my neighbor got a 900 dollar fine for not accepting her company-funded (very expensive) medical insurance this year.\s\sThen again at least it doesn't contain the xenophobia of The Great Wall of Trump so wtf.He can lay all the plans and make all the proposals he likes -- but with the present Congress none of them are ever going to get off the ground. FDR had a strongly favorable Democratic-controlled Congress to work with. Bernie would have the recalcitrant GOP. He would be spinning his wheels for four years.Is the same not true for Clinton? I don't see the republicans jumping for joy over a $12 minimum wage and expanding Obamacare. Her platform may be significantly less progressive but the republicans are still going to through absolutely everything they can against it. I'm not sure what Clinton is going to do to get her proposals through more successfully than Bernie's.\s\sAt least Bernie will have an army of hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) calling/writing representatives and raising awareness of the republicans' obstructionism not to mention galvanizing the left and engaging a previously politically apathetic generation.\s\sPlus some disagree with Bernie but even those that do generally still respect him for his integrity and honesty. I'm not sure how much that will help him (maybe a little maybe a lot) but it's definitely better than being disagreed with *and* hated and there a great many people out there that really despise Clinton (though not me for the record).Bernie is the only one who hasn't been caught straight up lying. I feel like he is one of the only candidates who has a consistent voting record. He wanted to push bills in during the 90s to cut military spending and he hasn't changed his stance today. He has said ""working class people"" far more than any other candidate which applies to just about everyone reading this. Bernie has brought up the offshore tax havens that allow huge companies to skate by on taxes. I was also very impressed with him whipping out a Kissinger reference during the debate: http://youtu.be/fCjQbTEuoDU\sHillary vacations with Kissinger btw. \s\s\sHere is Hillary lying: http://youtu.be/-dY77j6uBHI\s\s\sI'm not sure if there is a trump video similar to the one above but I do remember seeing a quote by him saying he would run as a republican and lie his ass off to get elected. How about going into the ""food deserts"" Walmart left behind and creating community gardens. Govt trained teams could go in and create non-profit gardens/greenhouses with the hope that they could eventually train locals to take over or hire people willing to stay. Walmart should have to hand over their old abandoned property or sell at a discount. Just a thought.I'm still gonna vote for Webb or possibly the Republican who's name I can't remember.Just something close to moderate.While other commentators seem to focus on how this man ""abused"" the civic minded ""pollster"" I believe they are missing the actual point. This type of tactic is pure evil and should be banned. The Clinton campaign needs to be called out on it and embarrassed by it. And yes I will be voting for Bernie and have contributed to his campaign and will continue to contribute. >However sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.  The staffer manning the telephone conducting the interview had no clue who she was talking to.\s\sOkay.  You have fun with that crazy person.  \s\sThe author of this article has issues politics aside.  And I'm leaning towards Sanders myself this article made me uncomfortable with that.  :pThe fact is that it was hardly ""Push Polling"" if he is voting for Sanders he's probably registered with the state democratic party in some capacity. Which means he is an id'd Democrat and on the lists that the party leased out to both campaigns. He probably berated some poor 21 year old field organizer who was doing voter ids and persuasion. Or worse  a high school student who was volunteering with the campaign. Whoever wrote this article is an asshole plain and simple.  Volunteers for campaigns make polling calls like this all the time they likely haven;t a clue what push polling is and though it's clear they're out of there depth the author took complete advantage of the situation to relentlessly mock one of the few people who take civics seriously and worse than that proceeding to continue to harass and denigrate the victim online.  I personally despise Hillary Clinton but the author of this article is little better.The author of this piece is factually wrong on several points; it actually is true for example that if you are a progressive who is in favor of immigration reform that Bernie's record there is mixed at best and Hillary's record on the subject is much stronger.That's what what you took away from that?The least I can give this hero is an ùpvote. Shit.I never know whether to upvote this kind of thing. It's all so dark and on one hand OP is sharing this news so upvote. But on the other hand this person has been shot dead so no vote/down vote.Jair Bolsonaro is celebrating I'm sure. All in all I guess if all Nations wanted to protect the Amazon rain forest the United Nations should've stepped in and bought the entirety of the Amazon. This way assholes like the current president and international companies like Cargill for (example) couldn't benefit from it's destruction.It wouldn’t surprise me if Jair Bolsonaro has something to do with the assassination....The fascists come marching in and they aren’t being stopped.Shocked! I just so shocked at this murder. Ok not that shocked. It was expected.And sparkly rainbows glisten from his golden halo...\s\sHey I like this guy as much or more than most of America but all this ""frill nonsense"" isn't really conducive to getting his REAL message out.\s\sEven if you repeat endlessly what he really has to say then do that rather than making him out to be ""St. Bern"".It says something that he could only command that much for speaking engagements.Clinton foundation has hundreds of millions of dollars for charitable works. But who cares about that? Get on the Bernie circle jerk!The Clinton Foundation's charitable support doesn't negate Bernie Sanders' donation. \s\sThe Clinton Foundation does some great work but this donation is of a different nature.

He didn't just see a teen with weed and shoot him did he?Basically the cop ran up on the car with the teen in street clothes with his gun drawn demanding that he roll down the window. The teen freaked out and tried to drive away. What isn't apparent is if the cop showed him his badge and said he was a cop or not before shooting. A witness says he didn't but the cop says he did.\s\sThe teen probably thought he was being car jacked and panicked. The cop says he got pinned between the door and the car next to it when the teen was driving away. The passenger in the car said that the cop wasn't pinned. Plus the cop apparently mistreated the dead teen's friend after getting her out of the car. A witness gives the same account as the surviving teen in the car with the dead one. Perspective from the cop: off duty in an apt complex where he lived and worked security. Sees some ""suspicious activity involving drugs"" in a car. Approaches with firearm drawn. Car backs up and hits him. He shoots and kills the driver. \s\sProbable perspective from the 17 year old: sitting in a parked car (possibly smoking weed) and see a man in regular clothes with a gun approach. Try to get the fuck out and hit guy in process. Shot dead. \s\sI can't believe the officer didn't face any charges. Unbelievable. BUT BUT BUT PRO-LIFE!\s\sFucking numbskulls in my state.

Nonono don't you get it? We need to cut welfare because these people need to be responsible and stop having kids they can't afford!\s\sI couldn't even parse that as I said it myself You've missed the point. It's a matter of principle not economics.  From an anti abortion pov all I repeat *all* that matters is a child's life is saved.  You may not agree with that stand but economics is not taken into consideration.\s\sEdit: Grammar.>Any such agreement would almost certainly exclude Planned Parenthood from future financing. Though the Planned Parenthood clinics that used to provide state-subsidized care never performed abortions Republican lawmakers are enforcing rules in the state’s family planning programs that ban providers “affiliated” with clinics that perform abortions. (By this logic because some Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortions none of them can receive state money.)\s\sMoney is fungible. If PP was going to spend $100 on mammograms and I give them $100 and say ""Don't use it for abortions"" they can spend my $100 on mammograms and use the $100 that they had planned to use for mammograms on abortions. I'm not taking a side here but the author of this article either knows this and is being deceptive or is pretty uninformed.\s\sI don't have a solid opinion on abortion but birth control should be a non-issue.If you have 0 dollars and are given 100 dollars (the cost to perform a mammogram in our hypothetical case.) and spend it performing a mammogram. How do you now have an additional 100 dollars to perform an abortion? This is a silly thing to say. This point aside the clinics that had been recieving state funding hadn't been the ones performing abortions anyway.I'm not a lawyer.\s\sI'm not an economist.\s\sI don't attend a a  Ivy League school.\s\sI've never held political office.\s\sI am a 24-year-old Texan who is getting an Associate's in Web Design at a vocational school and even **I** knew it was fucking stupid to defund Planned Parenthood to nothing because lol what happens when the impoverished can't afford contraceptives or the better-off can't get necessary abortions? They have children. And what happens when the impoverished have children? It costs the taxpayer in more welfare checks.\s\sThis is what happens when you would rather enforce moral laws rather than progressive no-one's-fucking-business-but-your-own laws.* Tax Churches.\s* Pay for kids.[looking at the source of the article all I could think of..](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ooPBXfnIpYI#t=22s)\s\sbut really on topic: I am just so sick of how stupid our state acts sometimes trying to act ""conservative"" for sake of being conservative sometimes...\s\slately i've been hearing rumbling about drug testing wellfare.. yeah great idea after how well that went in florida. good job Texas. (under breath) fuggin' idiots...[deleted]And that whole Pro-Life stance might hold water if they followed through. \s\sBut so often we seem them wanting a prohibition on condoms and BC pills; and then when the the unwanted and unplanned child is born to remove any social net for the mother and child leaving them to drop out of school reduce their lifetime earning potential and be a burden on their family.\s\sThey are more like ""Pro-Birth-At-Any-Cost"". This not a ""human life"":\s\shttp://i.imgur.com/koYcQ.jpgNot really. What's the other side?No folks that support these sorts of things do not think rationally.  Therefore they do not see the ramifications of these type of actions.I give the other side a hard time because they refuse to adequately fund the consequences of their actions acceptably.  \sI really really wish HALF the funding that existed for pro-life groups helped fund the organizations that actually care and support unwanted children and poor single parent familes.\s\sInstead ophranages are often ignored and poor single parents are often GUILTED for having a children they can't afford by themselves to raise.You can't even articulate ""the other side"" you speak of. What other side? What the fuck are you even talking about?  \s\sEDIT: No answer. See these holier-than-thou tool bags are just towing their religiously driven ideology and they don't even understand it.This is really a perverse argument.  If founding was the only issue then we should kill everyone on welfare for a cost of one bullet per person.  But the decision about abortion is much more than money it is about human rights.  (I am personally pro-life but I cannot justify using governmental funds for personal family planning decisions.)You do understand that planned parenthood did a much bigger business in pregnancy prevention than abortions right?  Which... before an egg is fertilized the thing isn't even a zygote let alone a fetus or an infant.You mean 27340 fewer homicides? \s\sIt isn't an economic issue for pro lifers. \s\sHoly crap if my girlfriend is on the pill or I am wearing a condom when we have sex we are committing homicide?!?

They pretty much just cut and pasted everything from the article they sourced from which itself didn't bring any new information to light.\s\sHowever!  The numbers themselves are staggering.  The amount of money that was funneled out of the Federal Reserve to private institutions with no oversight and no accountability ... it numbs the mind.  I don't see how one could simply be outraged; one must be awestruck as well.  All of the money in the world amounts to about $75 trillion and the Federal Reserve added $16 trillion that they just made up out of thin air.  I don't see how anyone can look at those numbers and not see that we're teetering on the edge of a total catastrophe.  \s\sSo the article sucks and we can definitely shoot the messenger here for being a spammer.

Why do you hate women?It’s not really a reasonable policy to try to police wishing someone’s death at all. One of the most asinine rules that I see anywhere Reddit in particular.

Notice however that people who are already on private property are neither affected by the order nor exempted from the order. If you are on private property you do not have to follow orders to go elsewhere on your property. The police cannot decide that you must be in your kitchen and shoot rubber bullets at those standing in the bathroom. Your balcony is your home and these individuals violated Federal law and should be prosecuted for assault and violation of Title 18 USC which since a fired projectile was intended to cause bodily harm allows for a 10 year prison term for the person who took the shot.So how did you figure out this is MN?With such a one sided attack strategy I wonder if he hacked anything.

0,AnythingGoesNews,guns,207,"So. Can you have a weapon cased and unloaded in NY(C)? I am confused as to what law was broke gun wise.\s\sThe rest of this story is the Navy dude being stupid. First mistake allowed officer to search truck. Only and I mean only if you're traveling through to another state. Even then that's a FOPA defense allowed not an exception to the rule.He made a mistake while trying to be nice. This is the problem. The cops now don't give a shit about the community. Back in the day you had a beat cop and EVERYONE knew him. When he caught kids doing things they shouldn't...he didn't arrest them. He scolded them and told their parents. Now we have these faceless almost militarily trained people. It really is sad.As a New Yorker I'm glad I don't live in NYC. If I were to get a carry permit in upstate it would be good in just about all of NY except NYC.\s\s\sedit: I forgot to type my original point. Yes you can have a gun cased and unloaded in your car. Apparently not in NYC.I'm amazed at how many traffic stops turn up guns.\s\sDon't consent to a search!If you don't consent sometimes they'll just call in for a warrant anyways. That would be more common on the interstate though.And probably don't have illegal guns? I'm all for gun rights and I'm against most gun laws but you still have to follow the dumb laws if you don't want to be charged with not following the dumb laws.You don't consent? That's suspicious I better get a warrant and go ahead with the search...Whether you consent to a search or not is mostly irrelevant. When they arrest you they then impound your vehicle and ""inventory"" it under the guise of making sure everything is in order for when you get it back. But they get to admit pretty much everything they find into evidence.Cops can actually search your car (in many states) if they stop you for a traffic infraction since you broke the law. The only reason you don't get arrested for minor offenses is because they're minor and common...  that said you can in theory be arrested for a minor offense (depending on the situation) which means the cops can search your car if they think something's up...\s\sThey however cannot search your car while pulling you over if you haven't done anything illegal (usually).I think I will write a screenplay/script using this event as opening scene. Basically Frist Blood reduxI'd watch it.Cop # 1: can you please prove you are a navy SEAL?\s\sNavy SEAL: *snaps cop #2's neck with his thumb and forefinger*\s\sCop #1: you are... Free to go sir.

Nice :)He could have killed YOUR kids with THAT MURDERING GUN!Is Yahoo the major media outlet? Miracles do happen on occasion. I'm surprised they published the guys name.  The whole thing sounds fishy; there might be something wrong with the guy or he might have been intoxicated.  SEAL usually have more discipline then spouting off stuff about being a SEAL and / or having clearances [what difference does that make anyways?]. Being a SEAL/ having top secret clearance is not something that is supposed to be kept under wraps. On the other hand it isn't a free pass either so I'm not totally clear on what he was trying to achieve there.Not all SEALs are created equal. You have your professional ones (more likely to get to be tier 1 types) and those types who think they're Capt. America.IIRC The charges were deferred due to the Navy intervening in this case as he will be evaluated for PTSD. I once got out of a fairly serious situation that I was implicated in when I was home on leave from Ft. Bragg but left to go back to base instead of returning the sheriff's calls.  I knew that once I got back to base there was no way that I would have to deal with that crap and I was correct.\s\sTimes have changed.This kinda reminds me of [this story.](http://presscore.ca/2011/?p=4967) I always thought it would have been something else to watch soldiers challenging an FBI team like this.You mean he ran a red light had an illegal weapon with ammo in the vehicle claimed to be a SEAL but had no ID and they still arrested him? What kind of world are we living in when claiming to be an operator won't convince a cop to let you slide on gun charges? \s\sWhy just last week I emptied a magazine at a guy who cut me off in traffic and when some city cop (whose salary I pay btw) came sniffing around I just said ""I was 7th in my series at BUD/S what did you ever do?"" and he got the message. They know not to mess with the best or people who claim to be the best. I would at least have him prove his SEALitude by slamming out 150 pushups. If he could do that and I was a NY cop I'd just take him to regular jail.i agree with you but putting the guy in pyshc is a bit much. arrest him charge him done. they probably did it to fuck with him knowing there would be a longer process time or something like that >had an illegal weapon\s\s""illegal weapon"" my ass.  What's illegal is any statute that purports to prohibit peaceful citizens from keeping and bearing arms.Yeah.. he didn't do that.  He had a handgun in a super-common caliber and some ammo and he claimed that he had a legal right to carry that handgun due to being military personnel.Why did he not have his DA 31 on him?[deleted]>had an illegal weapon with ammo in the vehicle\s\sYou know other than that silly amendment in the Bill of Rights which says you can keep and bear arms. The dude had a unloaded common handgun in a case. Seriously?I like how it's now ok to post someone's name unit information and clearance information in an article like this.  &#3232;\_&#3232; * An estimated 854000 people nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington D.C. hold top-secret security clearances.\s\sjust sayen.\s\shttp://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/\sAnyone else think the psych ward bit wasn't entirely on him claiming to be a SEAL and instead had more to do with his ""babbling incoherently"" and claims he was above the law and that would explain why he was taken into custody by the military for treatment for post-traumatic stress?\s\sIn other words sensational headline is sensational?Defensive police being creative?>and instead had more to do with his ""babbling incoherently"" and claims he was above the law\s\sI'd be more likely to attribute that statement to lying city cops.If I'm any sort of military and I'm not carrying ID I shut the fuck up until I can back up anything I say. I'll post it again. For non-residents City law (ACNY 10-305 subdivision I-1 to be exact) gives you 24 hours to pass through the city with a firearm (""assault weapons""included). Everyone passing through with their guns should have a copy of this printed out just in case. \s\sNow was this guy just passing through or was he in town for awhile? Working in a jail I hear.this all the time. I have no way of telling if it's true or not. But I always try to remember what if he is telling the truth and this Guy could kill me with one judo chop. So he ran a red light and tried to get out of a ticket by claiming he was above the law? Why did he not have his military ID? Was he still active duty?\s\sSounds like the police did the only thing they could do. They took him to the hospital and contacted the Navy to sort it out.!

Unless I missed it I didn't see that in the article.Bottom Line: New York's firearm laws are an insult.But they are still laws.I guess theyre gonna have a hard time ignoring the fact that their gun laws need to be dealt with.Nope. They will continue to ignore it.  A state preemption law like Ohio's would be good. \s\s\shttp://codes.ohio.gov/orc/gp9.68\s\sR.C. 9.68\s\s>R.C. 9.68 is a general law that displaces municipal firearm ordinances and does\snot unconstitutionally infringe on municipal home rule authority.\s\sAh that's one thing I love about New York.  As a Californian I have *someone* that I can feel superior to regarding gun laws.Sad but true...  fuck CA gun laws...I hope one of these retarded gun cases works it's way to the Supreme Court and New York's bullshit gun laws are ruled unconstitutional.[deleted]>> it seems like 90% of those in NYC are crooks\s\sBased on what?There are like 30000 cops in NYC.  Yes there are going to be some bad apples but I haven't really seen anything to convince me that they are worse as a ratio than anywhere else.\s\sI doubt very much they would go through the trouble of trying to commit someone for no reason.  If the guy is pissing you off and you want to get him in trouble why not just beat him up and arrest him on some trumped up charge like usual?  Sending a person for a psychiatric evaluation takes extra effort and could potentially result in the person being genuinely helped as well as ""getting away with"" their crime - something an ~evil and corrupt~ cop would not want.While your statistic is in all likelihood an improvisation it is in my view that even if only 10% of a given profession are unethical/amoral/etc everyone within that profession that turns a blind eye or hides behind ""We'll handle it within"" is complicit. This coming from a teacher. \s\sWhen it comes to something as crucial as law enforcement transparency is necessary. Protecting a coworker that does wrong because they are your coworker means you are willing to accept the blame as well for their misdeed.They make him sound insane i hope we can see the dash cam footage. That is if the pigs didn't make it vanish.Never ever go to New York!  Just abstain....... courteously.Well just last week you had a Navy SEAL blow his head off while attempting to impress his drunken lay. I don't think being a SEAL means as much as it used to...I think people downvoted you because they don't like what you're saying - not that it's irrelevant. \s\sThe guy was running a red light and likely wasn't legally in possession of the pistol (Not that NYC's gun laws are anything but retarded) - so he's not faultless (in the legal sense).\s\sHopefully these spates of arrests; Medical student Navy SEAL former Marine will convince people that gun laws here really need to change. Means you can balance a beach ball on your nose.  Everyone is an idiot when they are drunk and you don't have to be a gun safety expert or even a gun aficionado to be a SEAL. Plus that particular SEAL had JUST graduated.As a favor to the rest of this less-backwards-than-NYC state please specify that this happened in the shitty.Fuck NYC. Absolutely never going to that shit hole again. Hey man can you protect our country for next to fucking minimum wage. Wait you legally have a gun? Get the fuck in jail. haha fucking morons\s> next to fucking minimum wage\s\sTo be fair it's less than minimum wage at times...Fuck everything about this. This fucking shit is fucking fucked.This looks like something from r/Bad_Cop_No_DonutClearly there are two sides to every story and this doesn't add up. How did he go from being pulled over to having his vehicle searched? [deleted]I agree thank you for your sacrifice Day and for your courage. Sometimes people forget soldiers are exposed to very intense situations that can possibly result in shell-shock syndrome and others alike. \s\sRegardless of anyone's initial reasons for enlisting at the end of the day; It's people like him making a commitment to place themselves in front of the front lines for country and it's inhabitants that plays a vital role in all our safety. \s\sAlthough this news article includes facts of the situation there are a lot of unaccounted variables not stated that are necessary in order to make a sound decision where he was in the right or wrong. \s\sPoint blank we don't know the ENTRIE dialog between the soldier and the officer to place judgement because none of us were there \s\sWe should just hope that his training acquired durning BUDs and 'Pain 101' school will help aid in whatever recovery he needs mental and/or otherwise. \s\sAgain Day no one is perfect war takes a toll.. Hope u find solace  Instead they should have just taken his word on being a SEAL and let him get away with breaking the law?This is stupid.Can a police officer claim to be qualified to recommend someone for a psychiatric evaluation if they have never had one themselves? \s\sJust saying.New York police are dicks.DONT THEY KNOW THE MILITARY IS ABOVE ALL LAWS!!!!1!!\s\sHERO HERO HERO!!!!!stands to reason - if he really *was* a Navy SEAL they wouldnt have been able to make the arrest right?Why?  Because he's Weapon X?  I read and article a few years ago about an off base training mission for some special forces group (not sure if it was SEAL or <unnamed>).  They were pulled over by state troopers.  The soldiers thought it was part of the training.  When the trooper tried to handcuff the soldier he tried to fight the trooper.  The trooper put distance between himself and the soldier and shot and killed him as per **his** training.The NYPD always something newNote that while traditionally common law courts tended to recognize a limited right to resist an unlawful arrest modern American jurisprudence is **firmly** against this and has been for about the last century.Very true. I don't think any bystanders should jump in and try to help someone resist arrest as bystanders only have about 10-15 seconds of the story but a citizen ABSOLUTELY has the right to resist unlawful arrest. You can fight the system but you can't (shouldn't) fight the ride.I like that phraseNot exactly sure what this has to do with guns...Ah it might have been [/r/ccw](/r/ccw) that we were talking about the interference into felonies...(?) but it was intended to be a followon to the legal issues of interfering. Agreed Sucks you got downvoted for pointing that out...  Kinda cool article even if it was completely misleading but yeah this wasn't the subreddit for it...This would not fly in the US. Cops are unfortunately considered the absolute authority over the citizenry.Historically some American courts did recognize the right to resist an unlawful arrest.  But no court has done so since the 19th century.Reading the end of that made me quite upset ""You don't **** with the cops"".\s\sSigh.YES!\s\sThis has become too much the case in the USA. Cops are NOT untouchable and should not be. We absolutely have the right to argue with and insult them AND if (and only if!) they perform unlawful acts RESIST or deter them by the means they use! SO the real question is whether or not the officer knew he was making an invalid arrest or if any of the bystanders knew. This is why we have courts. It is the courts role to bring all evidence to light and weigh who was at fault and who was innocent. I suppose that court decided that the woman's defenders were innocent and the cops were at fault but it seems that the street in the heat of the moment is a bad place for such decisions to be made and she should have been arrested and witlessness brought forth in a court room. Saw this in [/r/politics](/r/politics) and figured it would be appreciated here.  Interesting ruling on resisting an unlawful arrest.\s\sEdit:  This happened a while back in the UK;  Not a recent event.yeah the responses I read in the OP stated this happened in the 1700's but the article was retooled to make it seem like it happened recently.  your post get upvoted your reason for posting gets downvoted. \s\sI found the article interesting but difficult to read at times. I would have to disagree with the authors choice to re-contextualize the story to appear as a modern day event. I found it confusing and misleading. It also makes me question the legitimacy of the authors argument.\s\sIf I were to make a similar argument I think it would be more effective to describe the 17th century event and then the appropriate following rulings and how they changed the law- and why those rulings are incorrect.\s\sBut enough rant thanks for sharing the linkYou act like the TSA's goal is safe travel.It's okay the body scanners aren't about security they're about TSA executives giving their friends at the body scanner companies(and eventually themselves) a big payday.Funny story about the TSA that I experienced a few days ago.  I was flying from Minneapolis to Tampa.  I had my camera in a bag as my carry on.  I did the normal routine put my stuff through the xray scanner walked through the nude body scanner etc.  \s\sSo I arrived in Tampa with no problems.  Well sort of.  As I opened up my camera bag getting off the flight there was my folding knife (4 inch blade)  sitting in it.  I had completely forgotten about it and it was with me the entire time on the flight.  \s\sI brought a knife on a plane by accident and got away with it.  Probably happens 5ooo times a day.I've done that with a folding boxcutter much like the ones used in 9/11 accidentally in my carryon.  At least it's not as bad as this guy http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/12/21/man-accidentally-carries-loaded-gun-onto-plane-tsa-failure-rate-may-approach-70/\s\sHe accidentally brought on a .40 cal handgun that they missed...  Good thing for him they didn't find it they find around 1200 guns a year and all of those people end up with felony firearm charges.I accidentally took a Leatherman through once.  It was just under my untucked shirt.  Apparently the metal detector wasn't running at the time though they acted like it was.  Got to my destination and noticed it as I picked up my bags.  ooops.Did you bring it back with you or ditch it in Tampa?Why go through the scanner at all? Opt out!I brought back 4 lapis-handled pocket knives from Afghanistan for family members.  Threw them in my carry-on luggage thinking to myself ""I want positive control over these because I can't just buy new ones at Wal-Mart"".  Went through customs in Kuwait security in Ireland and TSA in Atlanta.  No one caught it.  Didn't realize what I'd done until I unpacked my bag in front of my wife two or three days after I got home and she asked me how I'd managed to carry those on the plane with me.You didn't have nail clippers so they let it slide.For whatever reason from reading the title I thought this was a change in policy not incompetence. I thought guns were allowed now if you carried them on your person in a certain way. I got to ""fucking worthless twats"" and then figured someone screwed up.  Up until then I assumed it was the most bizarre policy change in history.Sooo all a terrorist has to do is learn how to sew pockets??Good thing terrorists can't sew for shit.\sNo you always could.  It's just getting more publicity now.Not with old fashioned metal detectors. I think the point of the title is that all this fuss over ""terrorist threats"" that has repeatedly been used to justify chipping away at our civil liberties has in fact made us *less* safe not more.A bit misleading title. \s\sTry that and get caught - now you are a candidate to a brand new cell in a state prison. There are lots of things you CAN do that will get you thrown in prison that doesn't change the physical possibilities of what you CAN do.You can read the original paper by [Kaufman and Carlson here](http://kochanski.org/gpk/misc/papers_that_shouldnt_be_lost/2010/kaufman_carlson2010.pdf).PDF WARNING!Counterpoint from the same article posted to r/TrueReddit\s\shttp://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/qkxp1/1b_of_tsa_nude_body_scanners_made_worthless_by/c3yg6e8\s\sBasically it's an argument that tsaoutofourpants is wrong. The background of the full body scan is not black but gray and metal will still show up as black.[deleted]*In the U.S.*\s\sHe claimed (correctly) that no one has successfully brought explosives onto a plane *in the United States*.  People have gotten explosives onto planes in other countries which then entered U.S. airspace yes but what he's saying is this nonsense about how necessary these body scanners are in U.S. airports is **nonsense** because despite the fact that we 'only' had metal detectors and x-ray machines for the last 30-40 years or so no one not once in the last 40 years has ever exploited that and brought explosives through security in a U.S. airport and onto the plane.\s\sNo we don't need those fucking scanners yes the metal detectors and x-ray machines were working just fine.My friend took a live 00 buck shell from Florida to London and back a few months ago.Remember he didn't succeed in even lighting the fuse. The same mixture was later used by the underwear bomber Umar Abdulmutallab and it turned out to be more incendiary than actually explosive.[underwear bomber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Farouk_Abdulmutallab)\s\s[shoe bomber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_bomber)\s\sThough both boarded planes in other countries headed to the US.Didn't watch the entire video but.. Can't they just take side pictures as well as front and back to fix this?Borrowing a reply from tsaoutofourpants in another thread:\s\s> It's actually not quite that simple. The software would have to be reprogrammed you'd get twice the dose of radiation and it would take twice as long (which is actually a big deal). There's a 40%+ false positive rate per scan which if you had to be scanned twice (once front/back once side) the false positive would be 64%+ requiring 2/3 of people to have a pat-down. Also this is only one exploit of the body scanner -- there are more that would not be fixed by this solution but this is the one I chose to publish.They can but they do not. The point is that the TSA or even the manufacturer should have figured this out and acted accordingly. Increases images per passenger means more time per passenger...It doesn't matter if they take side pictures because you can still hide explosive or weapons in flesh density bags around your waist which show up like part of your belly.  You can also hide items in your rectum.  Side pictures wouldn't fix the ineffectiveness of the scanners it would just prevent this one vulnerability.give TSA a good shot of the ole JohnsonI was expecting this to be from [/r/conspiracy](/r/conspiracy) glad to see things like this in less crazy(?) sub-reddits.so he carried something that wasn't dangerous through a scanner and this causes outrage?  looks like TSA worked and didn't stop someone for a harmless piece of metal.  how does this mean i can now carry a gun through TSA checkpoints?\s\si don't think this video proves anything.  Have you flown recently? You can't even bring your belt through a checkpoint on your person it gets xrayed. If TSA saw that box you can bet money that guy would have been patted down or wanded. But he wasn't so they didn't. I forgot to take my wallet out going through a scanner recently. After explaining and showing it to them they looked through the wallet patted me down and checked me for bomb residue.Ignore the crazy-man-waves-gun aspect.  Ignore the guy flipping out about being slightly delayed and the argument over how many items were in the cart.\s\sThis line is the scariest one in the whole story:\s> Thurmond was the only one arrested -- for misdemeanor battery for shoving an officer. Thurmond didn't even know the man was with law enforcement.\s\sHe got arrested for shoving an officer who had never identified himself as such.  You can't just *forget* that you're not in uniform and then react like you still have the power you would have at work.  Until you show a badge you're just a crazy man with a gun.\s\s[Something very similar](http://thepursuitofliberty.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/plain-clothes-officer-pulls-gun-on-motorist-for-speeding-threaten-to-jail-him-for-recording-the-incident/) happened in Maryland about two years ago.  When a man dressed in civilian clothing starts approaching and waving a gun most of us are going to try to shoot him.  But from today's article it sounds like his anonymity won't matter and we'll be treated like we'd shot a uniformed officer.\s\sNot cool.Holy fucking shit that line caused me to fly off the handle.I'm no fan of the police but I'm not sure the motorcycle video is a very good example of a cop being out of line. A lot of agencies run specific stings to catch rice burner assholes doing dumb shit on the highway. They do this because their patrol cars aren't fast enough to catch the bikes otherwise. So this isn't necessarily how the state police would pull over a minivan full of kids on the way to soccer practice.\s\sThe fact that the rider had a camera in his helmet indicates to me that he was probably either getting ready to do or had already done some dumb shit that he was later planning to post on youtube.I would question the mental maturity of a police officer that would engage in such a heated verbal exchange over such a trivial matter in the first place. He doesn't sound stable enough to carry a BADGE let alone a gun.  Exactly. I think with the right to carry a concealed weapon comes a responsibility to be more patient more in control and even more law-abiding that the ""average"" person. The responsibility of a LEO should be even higher. This guy obviously is in the wrong line of work. Probably shouldn't even be living within 50 miles of another human being.Ok now my question is this.. He was in plain clothes and supposedly never stated that he was a police officer. If you were in any other situation where a man was waving a gun at your pregnant wife or any family member of yours and you have your carry permit you would be allowed to protect your family. If this asshole never showed a badge or anything to prove he was a cop and was waving a gun at your wife and arguing with her and you decided to draw to protect your wife what would happen?\s\sThink if this was at an ATM? This officer will end up getting himself shot by a law abiding citizen with a permit if he keeps this kinda shit up.\s\sWhat's your opinions on how you would handle this situation? Would you have drawn on him or would you risk your life or your wife's to ask the guy what was going on? you bet your ass if you drew your gun he'd shoot to kill then say it was self defense and say you were trying to kill an officer of the law. Opinions?I'd like to know as well. If it had been me and a guy pulled a gun on me and my pregnant wife. I would of shot him dead where he stood badge or no badge. A ""shove"" doesn't warrant that type of response and LEO is supposed to be trained to not escalate a situation. Clearly not what happened here.[deleted]I don't think you fully read the article. Both your discussion of the incident described and your title sound like you're confused about what allegedly took place. It says that the officer drew his gun after he was shoved by the husband not that he was waving it around at the wife when the husband returned.Legally in most areas no you would not be in the right. I think that's bullshit but just because something should be a certain way doesn't mean it is and you should at least know that you are going to be violating the law.Hahahahaha the black guy gets arrested for battery and the cop is ""under investigation""!  I wonder how long shit like this will stand?It has nothing to do with him being a ""black guy"" and everything to do with him being a lowly civilian vs protected law enforcement class.the rest of our lifetimes ""Im the police...I run shit here...you just live here.""The black guy was arrested because he did something illegal: he shoved someone.What a scumbag. This man is a disgrace to the badge he represents. 12 items in a 10 items or less line? Sounds like a reasonable way to react to me. *thumbs up*That guy is a huge douchebag. The cop needs to be fired publicly shamed and put in jail for a stretch. \s\sMaybe he will learn not to flex his badge in public. Being a cop doesn't make you special without the uniform you are just another crazy guy with a gun who flips on a preggo lady over a few items. For shame. What the Fuck is wrong with police officers or any agent of the the Law ones shooting his fellow officer and the other is pulling a gun on a pregnant woman WHAT THE FUCK Honestly the connotations of the precedent set here are terrifying. If a weapon is drawn during a confrontation the response we are trained for is to draw aim and fire. No questions no warnings no waiting to see if he is really just having a random desire to clean his gun. He has escalated this confrontation from a light shove to involve deadly force.  I should be well within my right to respond as such regardless of who the aggressor was.The fact he is an officer should be irrelevant because in that store with no badge no uniform and no announcement he was just a citizen and absolutely nothing more. I'm terrified to think of this situation happening to me because my pregnant wife would be in tears that cop would no longer have a chest cavity and my ccw and myself would be locked away for a long time. Stupid sensationalist thread title...he pulled a gun on the man who pushed him NOT the pregnant woman. I'm not arguing in defense of the cop but deliberately mislabeling a story pisses me off. \s\sThe news article linked doesn't even say that YOU twisted the title in order to get karma\s\s\s\sHe got agitated at the pregnant woman over the groceries it appeared that he may have gotten physical with her husband shoves hidden-cop in defense of his wife guy pulls out gun.\s\sThe incident arose over the groceries ergo the gun was pulled as a result arguably at best it was indirect so it's not a lie or misrepresentation. I didn't mis-label it Reddit did. I clicked the button. I could give two fucking shits about Karma. If I wanted that I'd go help out at homeless shelters...... Oh wait I already do that..... SorrySo what If I'm the guy whose wife just had a gun pulled on her in line at Wal-Mart and I have my EDC?  As I understand it when a gun comes out during an altercation I don't have to ask anymore questions my EDC comes out and gets used.  So what would have happened if I shot and killed a police office in Wal-Mart and he hadn't identified himself?  ""we dont talk to police....we rely on the streets yall""\s\sanother great song: ""fuck tha policefuck tha policefuck fuck tha police""\s\sI give every officer I encounter (which is more than usual being in a college town) a chance but seriously...really like to assert their power for no reason.I guess no knock raids will either not happen or get really interesting in Indiana.The feds might still do some. Why? Because fuck you.\s\sThat would get interesting.John Bad Elk v. US already does this. Basically you are allowed to protect yourself from unlawful acts by police.As much as this is a step in the right direction I don't feel like this will do much. Unless you're ex SFOD-D a firefight between you and a SWAT squad will likely end with you dead for numerical reasons alone. You can't sue yourself back to life.\s\sI think that a bigger priority is to make sure search warrants are served with a knock instead of a battering ram.I agree if the police want you dead they will prevail by force and numbers. However I think this legislation aims at letting citizens and law enforcement know that the courts will stand behind the citizens if law enforcement officers are breaking and entering. It's a clear sign to law enforcement that this is not okay and a clear sign to citizens that they don't need to tolerate it. It is not however sanctioning murder as the article seems to imply. It would make no more sense to kill an officer for writing a speeding ticket than it would to kill one over a warranted search of one's home. As awesome as Delta is I don't think a single guy would be able to hold off an entire SWAT team. But it would be interesting to see a dramatization of this scenario. Well there's been precedent at the Federal level that you can kill a cop if they are trying to kill you (while you're innocent).Innocent until proven guilty so...Article is dripping with bias.\s\s""While announcing his decision to sign the bill into law Governor Daniels tried to claim that the law doesn’t declare an open season on police officers."" \s\sDid he try and fail at claiming? That one line tells you where the writer stands on this.This is coming from a very liberal voter with more democratic leanings than not but..\s\sDoes anyone else feel like the article is some seriously sensational bullshit with a lot of quoted dems. screaming OPEN SEASON! and not providing any actual factual reasoning behind their outrage?\s\sThis bill makes no-knock raids a problem for police the same way its been a problem for citizens. Guess now they have to knock and announce themselves instead of kicking down back doors and shooting dogs.I take it that is a very liberal website?\s\s>It’s the equivalent of Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law that led to the killing of Trayvon Martin. In that incident George Zimmerman believed he had the legal right to gun down a kid for walking through the neighborhood simply for being a young African American male strolling around the community at night. This article never outline what the bill was designed to do or why is was proposed in the first place... Isn't this just a law to prevent additional penalties for defending your home with deadly force and to give police additional guidelines about entering a home? What this law says is that a cop with an a fuck you I'm a cop I can do anything I want to attitude can't enter your hose without authorization.  This happens more then you would think.  I know of a couple of cases where police officers in Washington state have used their power as police officers to enter the homes of women they were romantically involved with and commit domestic violence.  One of them was Tacoma Police chief David Brame who later killed his wife who had left him and then committed suicide.  Seattle Police Officer Ronald Murray worked on the Domestic Violence task force and was arrested for dragging his girlfriend by the upper part of her jacket and hair through a gravel parking lot during a local Oktoberfest celebration.\s\sAlso it has been reported that domestic violence among Police Officers is 2-4 times more likely then the general public.  http://www.purpleberets.org/violence_police_families.htmlI hate it when people enter my hose without authorization. The Indiana Supreme Court recently decided that the killing of a cop even when such cop was in the mist of a felony in which deadly force could be used to stop it was to be considered murder according to what the laws of the State were at that moment. Basically if you shot a cop that was murdering babies at the local day care center you'd be going to prison no matter what.\sWhat this law does is to get rid of that stupidity. No-knock warrants are not ""covered"" by this law so you shoot a cop while serving one get ready to enjoy time at the local House of Pain. \sNothing else has changed and the BS has been running high on both sides of the argument. If by house of pain you mean a flurry of gunfire from his/her friends then you are correct.Good I always thought that law was retarded. This law will not apply to the FEDs.  Why?  Because Fuck you that's why.Also because a state can't make laws affecting federal authorities.stokedWOW! I'm frightened that this isn't an ""Onion"" article. I'm seeing more and more of this crap from schools. Schools who follow the book and only the book even when it doesn't make sense to a damn person. Like those kids who were suspended for wearing an American flag shirt on Cinco De Mayo. We are turning into a fucking pussy society. Stop this political correctness. It's literally destroying this country. ""No tolerance policy"" is just another way of saying ""I don't want to have to make a judgement call"".>Like those kids who were suspended for wearing an American flag shirt on Cinco De Mayo.\s\sWhat the fuck.\s\sEdit: apparently some of these kids were also saying anti-Mexican hate words and what not. A little more warranted.There was one kid who had an American flag on his bike when he rode to school. He was suspended because it might be offensive to others in the school. >.<\s\sIf it were my kid I would have dressed him up in a red/white/blue jumpsuit the next day and throw as many of those $1 flags on his bike as we safely could... and I would do the same. Bike up to the school together in this fashion. If they think one American Flag is offensive have fun with that!\s\sBesides.... don't they have the flag flying out front of the school? Don't they have the flag in the corner of every room?It's people who don't have the common sense to understand letter of the law and intent of the law. I don't understand what's causing this shift.> 'Political correctness'\s\s\sfuck political correctness >We are turning into a fucking pussy society. Stop this political correctness.\s\sOh shut up and take this award for participation with you!Or the girl who was sunburned because suncreen is a drug and hats are for gang members.Heh I first saw this story on /r/nottheonionAmen brotha\sLand of the free home of the brave. Your upvotes have restored a little faith in humanity.I'm not supporting this logic but this is the reason for zero tolerance policies to do with stuff like this.\s\sMaking a ""hand gun"" is legally considered uttering a threat in most jurisdictions.  Of course it's all about context.  Legality of that gesture hinges on the answer to the question: Did someone mean it to be a threat?  So in the education system they make a blanket rule that they're not going to allow it in any context - because it's way easier to enforce that blanket policy than to deal with a single case where someone _did_ use that gesture to threaten someone and it ends up in the legal system.\s\sTL;DR: The school boards have decided that making a judgement call that can result in millions of dollars in legal fees is above a teacher's or principal's pay grade.  Maybe if getting into education was a little better incentivized and compensated that wouldn't be the case.\s\sSource: My father was on the board of a very large teacher's union when all this zero tolerance shit started going down.\s\sEdit: It's not surprising the number of instances where zero tolerance policies _aren't_ enforced.  When you see them being enforced is when too many people know about an incident to ignore it.  A school board would literally fire everyone involved in sweeping something like that under the rug.[deleted]This actually kind of reminds me of that kid that brought a boy scout knife to school so he could cut an apple and then was almost expelled but oh the school board had mercy on this disturbed little monster and only suspended him for ALMOST TWO MONTHS!!!Literally? It's literally destroying the country? Martial law has been enacted and buildings are collapsing?\s\sEdit: Law of MarshallWhat's the story of the American flag thing? I bet that there's more to the story than you're saying. Maybe he was verbally harassing Latinos as well.I know this may sound odd but the Norway shooter Breivik said in his manifesto that our world is becoming WAY to PC. Making sure everyone is happy and do things exactly like book says it should be done.\s\sI know the guy is a looney but his kinda has a point.Quite a few of the kids who got in trouble on Cinco de Mayo were shouting racist phrases and interupting class so they weren't just ""wearing an American flag shirt.""Not mentioned: Boy has telekinetic powers and shoots holes in things when signing.I'd say that's a pretty important part of the story how could they leave *that* out!?POW! HAHA!When I was in junior high we watched 'Sergeant York' and then we had to *discuss* it. \s\sIt's amazing nobody got shot as we talked about his change of heart from conscientious objector to stone killer I guess.When I was in 5th grade I got to be a crossing guard. In the training they taught us that we were to observe but not interfere if anything was going wrong. But to always carry a sharpened pencil because in a pinch a sharpened pencil makes a better weapon than a pen. And that was considered normal instructions for kids my age.Anyone who can't perceive the difference between a gun and a three-year-old's hand is an absolute imbecile who has no business ""educating"" anyone. Mindlessly enforcing these idiotic ""no ____"" rules has got to stop.Things like finger guns are banned not because they're worried that someone will confuse them with real guns (that's as absurd as you think it is) but out of the belief that it's somehow encouraging violence or some bullshit like that. It's psychology rather than trying to avert a real threat.For school officials an easy guide to differentiating a finger gun and a real one:\s\sA finger gun is a particular shape formed by the human hands. Human hands are fleshy extrusions at the end of human limbs each with a central system of bones for stiffness and support.  A finger gun involved using muscles a biological material to move the fingers so that they point at someone or something in a manner reminiscent of a gun.\s\sAn actual gun is a metal machine designed to fire projectiles or ""bullets"".  They are generally held in human hands for use.  Unlike fingers they are not biological and are made of metal.  They can easily be distinguished from human hands by their distinctive profile.Exactly when did we as a country decide that policy takes precedence over common fucking sense?\s\sI missed that memo...[deleted]Probably somewhere around the time baby boomers started voting.Hunter was the 55th most popular name in America in 2011 according to: http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi\s\sEnjoy your lawsuit Nebraska.[deleted]It's insane. He's never heard the word ""Hunter"". He's deaf. He knows his name to be the *sign* for ""Hunter"". They are effectively asking him to change his name as he knows it.\s\sDeaf rights advocacy groups are going to go bananas.I knew we should have named him Steve!Deleted.I agree with everything but the PC bullshit part. FAR FROM IT. The PC thing to do is let the kid say his name by giving you the middle finger IF THATS HOW SHIT'S DONE. It is PC to allow people to be who they are. \s\sThis is fascist right wing soccer moms that want to parent other peoples children that ask for this shit.  They went full retard.Don't be Nebraska...don't be Nebraska....don't be - *FUCK!!*As a Floridian.  YES! FINALLY IT WASN'T US!Nothing is ever us! What are the chances?Do something about it!\s\shttp://www.gips.org/contact_us\s\sWhat I wrote:\s\sTo Whom It May Concern\s\sLike so many people before you are now in the middle of a storm that is brewing on the internet. Your blind and unthinking adherence to a policy that deprives a young deaf child from signing his own name has put you starkly in the light of disfavor.\s\sPlease cease this ridiculousness before your good name is completely besmirched by it. ""Zero tolerance"" is ""Zero thought"" and you must know (at least deep down) that this is wrong.\s\sLet the boy sign his name. Put out a statement denouncing your previous foolishness. Avoid the swarm of angry hornets that you have riled up.\s\sThis is a friendly letter inviting you to see reason and put aside the empty policy that requires no thought.Thanks for the link.  I just sent them this:\s>Zero tolerance policies are idiotic at the best of times (Zero tolerance = Zero thought process) but in the case of Hunter Spanjer it is absolute lunacy.  Do you realize your zero tolerance policy makes it unacceptable for a deaf person to finger spell *any* word with the letter 'H' in it?\s>\s>I will await the lawsuits brought against you under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  In the meantime I hope you have the sense to issue a public retraction and apology to this little boy and his family and learn to use the sense you were born with.A middle finger is the perfect sign for this situation.If he is forced to change his name sign I suggest this one.  Made with each hand and an alternating up and down motion.\sThis isn't just stupid it's weird. People like the educators here make me stop tilt my head slightly forward lower my brow stare and wonder in my mind if they are full on retard. Well f he wasn't gonna violate weapons policy before somebody's thinking about it now.  I really wanna meet the ""whistleblower"" who took issue with this.There goes my calm for the day. This level of stupid...What the hell is wrong with these people?!?! \sThis ""nothing that looks like a weapon"" policy is about as ignorant and poorly conceived as anything I can think of. \s\sI have to ask what happens when these children grow up and own a gun after being taught guns are only for violence? \s\sWhy don't we teach children that violence is wrong regardless of the tool used to deliver it? \s\sI can't help but wonder if these people would crowd in toward each other so tightly that the inner people get crushed to death when they are surrounded by wolves? \s\sIf I were this parent I would take a long hooked cane and a faithful collie with me to talk to these people. \s\sHas anyone stopped to consider what would happen if he brought a real gun to school after months of socializing his pro violence name...would educators even be able to identify a real gun vs his ""sign"" gun?\s\sIts called zero tolorance for a reason people...to much is at stake to risk letting this boy sign his name.  Also clearly his parents gave him that name because they support the military industrial complex and oppression of human rights like a violence free school.Just wait until his little brother **""Gunner""** starts school next year...zero tolerance is a bullshit excuse to not let educators and administrators think for themselves. All you're doing is teaching the kids how to blindly follow authority and bullshit rules.\s\sah shit I took seriously what was sarcastic. lolWhat if he's signing his name and the school police officer sees it as a threat so he guns down the 3-year old terrorist?\s\sHas anyone considered that?Certainly. I mean he's already got people so accustomed to his gun gesture that they wouldn't even notice a real gun. He'll surely come to school and start sticking a pistol in peoples faces. Everybody will think he's simply introducing himself. Before anybody even realizes that's not his name but an actual gun the whole classroom will look like a war zone.  \s  \sFurthermore I don't think they should allow pointing anymore. It too closely resembles a gun. No more counting on the fingers either. Ban peace signs as well and I don't think they should allow crossing of the fingers. High fives look a lot like somebody is throwing a weapon maybe a hand grenade or IED. These shouldn't be allowed.You've obviously never been the victim of fingergun violence. It's an epidemic in this country and I'm offended that you don't even consider the ramifications of this child being allowed to even bring a fingergun to school much less being allowed to possess one without a license. They should remove his index fingers to ensure that he cannot make such a violent shape with his hands!""it's called the three year old hand 7.  It's made of porcelain and can't be detected by metal detectors.  It costs more than you make in a month!""I'm sorry I've spent too much time on r/politics lately and I just can't tell for sure if you are being sarcastic...His name isn't gun it's Hunter which might rightly have a similar sign but I don't know.  In any case it's a modification of the sign to make it unique and signify that it's a name and not the real meaning so there isn't really a possibility of it being mistaken.  \s\sIn any case I can see you're being facetious./sarcasm?I'm thoroughly confusedI for one COMPLETELY SUPPORT your theory that school administrators are far too fucking stupid to be trusted to differentiate between harmless circumstance and actual deadly weapons.\s\sThe only sad part is that we don't trust them to exercise any discretion but we still trust them to lord it over our children and strip search them for drugs. Go figure.""Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself"" FDR**... and 3 year olds using sign language.* ^little_known_footnoteI'm naming my next child ""fully automatic assault weapon"".His middle name is ""With large capacity clips""\s\sHis last name is ""And the shoulder thing that goes up""This is proof that not only is duh alive and well but is thriving!

This school does not understand Deaf culture. That would be like telling someone with the last name 'Hymen' that they had to choose a new last name because the word is ""naughty"". *His older brother Gunner who is also deaf was taken into police custody and held without bail.*The age and his ability to hear are moot.  Hunter is not an uncommon name this is just beyond fucking ridiculous and asinine. Shaping young minds...You're fucking kidding me... This is why we can't have nice things America. Last year the new principal of my kids' elementary school activated the emergency notification system twice for ""gun-related incidents.""  The first time a kid was found to have a gun in his back pack. Fortunately it wasn't loaded or the outcome could have been much worse.\s\sThe second time a different kid brought ammunition for show-and-tell.\s\sOf course the ""unloaded gun"" was a water pistol (kids could have gotten wet!) and the ""ammunition"" was a civil war era bullet probably a minie ball (feel free to add the ""I'm French!"" mark wherever the hell it goes). A toy and an inert historical relic.  \s\sAt first I nodded in agreement about the unloaded gun situation.  Then reading further down I shook my head in disbelief and chugged some of my beer.>and the ""ammunition"" was a civil war era bullet\s\sso an inert piece of metal?Wow... So I guess i am naming my firstborn son SaifullahI'm naming my son Machine Gun Kelly Paging ""Motherfucker Jones"" to the principal's office. Motherfucker Jones.\sWell he is cleary fucked.  [deleted]You have got to be fucking kidding me.I came here to say the same thing. This level of political correctness and sheer lack of backbone is going to ruin this entire planet.When we lived in Hawaii my son kept getting in trouble at preschool for both tree climbing and making hand/finger guns and playing ""war"" with the other boys during recess. I was blown away. That was basically all I ever did until I was about 10 yeas old. \sWe moved to Kentucky while he was in kindergarten and about a week into the school year his teacher pulled me aside and said ""At recess today your son climbed up a tree and was shooting at the other little boys with his finger."" At this point I was cringing. I figured I was about to be chastised again thanks to this double whammy. However she continued on to say ""He sure is good a climbing. You should think about taking him to one of those climbing walls I bet he would just love it.""\s\sSometimes I get really pissed about living in Kentucky (see the r/politics post about ass-backwards science education) but other times...I really love the commonwealth.They asked the kid to change the sign for his name?  How about [this](http://workwithtobyandlayla.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/flip-the-bird.jpg)?\s\sAs a Deaf Social Worker I can tell you the family has two major points in their favor if they should sue the school board:\s\s1) Disability Discrimination - if Hunter had been born hearing the School Board would not be forcing him to change his name solely because it refers to the act of using a weapon.  However because he's Deaf and his natural language (ASL) refers to the use of a weapon they're prohibiting it.\s\s2) First Amendment Rights - the family's freedom of speech and cultural identity are being infringed upon by forcing their son to change his sign name (which is a big part of self-identification in Deaf culture)\s\sI grew up in the Deaf culture and spent elementary through high school in a Deaf cluster in which all the schools I went to were public schools with Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing students bussed in from all over the county.  This shit would not fly where I went to school.  Not to mention the ONLY reason that this even became an issue in the first place is because some uptight parent or staff member had to have complained about it when there was no reason to do so.\s\s**TL;DR** - Parents have a great opportunity for a discrimination lawsuit because this is pure discrimination and absolute bullshit.Way to make the national news Grand Island.He is speaking an official version of sign language.  If I were his parents I would sue the crap out of the school due to them discriminating against the boy based on his disability.  Just threatening to do that would probably be enough to make them change their policy.[deleted]This is ridiculous bullshit. These people are nuts. This kid is deaf and being able to sign his name like that is probably one of the coolest things ever for him and they're taking that away from him. Shame on them.RE-FUCKING-TARD-ID!\s\sNebraska... raising the bar on how to be stupid!Nebraska...the 'N' stands for knowledge.So signing ""Hunter"" is against school policy.... do they have Sign Language classes at all? I am sure at some point they learn the sign for hunter or gun or rifle.. .etc.\s\sAre they afraid the 3 year old is throwing out gang signs maybe?It's worse than that if you know the American Manual Alphabet.  The sign for 'H' is your middle and index fingers extended exactly like you would mimic pointing a gun.  They need to ban the letter 'H' for deaf people completely.I took Spanish last year and we didn't cover guns hunting or hunters at all. My teacher would have gladly told me but it just wasn't in curriculum.\s\sOh yeah las armas cazar Los cazadores y Los cuchillosUtterly ridiculous. I graduated high school from just outside Grand Island I can assure you it is the heart of ""Red State"" this won't last I am thinking. Good thing the school boards crack down Ob these dangerous deaf infants. Nice to see America is not wasting time and money on some ridiculous trumped up bullshitI don't know if I have ever heard of anything more retarded in my entire life.Zero tolerance is not an excuse for chucking common sense out the window. Added embarrassment for being from my hometown.  Some administrators need to grow a pair or at the very least borrow them from their wife.WE AS AMERICANS HAVE OFFICIALLY GONE FULL RETARD. GET ME OUT OF HERE OR HELP ME CHANGE IT. OVER.I've got a hand gesture for his school right here.Asking him to change his sign is pretty much like asking him to change his name.The sign for ""hunt"" (couldn't find hunter though I imagine it's ""one who hunts"" or ""I hunt"") is so not-gun related I can't see that this article isn't a joke.\s\shttp://www.handspeak.com/word/index.php?dict=hr&signID=3951\s\sedit: disregard me I need to read first.That's not the same language. That is American Sign Language but Hunter uses Signing Exact English.Way to go knee-jerk reaction media in America. If a kid came to school whose name could be seen as gun-related would he be made to change his *spoken* name to satisfy their stupid ZT policy?I'm thinking about naming my kid Hunter or Wesson just to find outWhen rules tell People what to do they stop thinking. Was this ever a problem for Colt McCoy? Hell Emmitt *Smith*?At the pace were going in this society we""ll turn into the biggest pussy of a nation on the planet. Think Chinese Russian or Japanese schools give a shit about this sort of stuff? Fuck no. Thank you baby boomers. thank youThank you for my daily dose of immutable rage.So much irrational fear.Our schools are being run by total idiots. No flash on work computers; Hunter looks like he's holding a gun?Cross your middle finger over your index finger on both hands.I am so glad that I got out of that hell hole called Grand Island. It makes me ashamed that I went to school there. =/AgreesWhat the FUCK is this?! We're turning into utter bitch-assed pussies come on he's a 3 year old DEAF KID and people are telling him he can't use his name because it's too violent?! Soon we'll be picking out every name with religious significance and saying you can't be named that either!!!""Zero tolerance"" means zero thinking. If the teachers and administrators don't want to think then what do you expect the kids to be taught?I equate zero tolerance to zero intelligence.This belongs in r/WTF...I'm a gun-owning democrat but I swear my reaction to things like this are 'god dang liberal pussies and their hippie girlfriends.' However that might be because I'm also from Berkeley.\s\sCan't believe this article is true.called him Bird and let him sign his name with the middle finger at school[Not Required to Change](http://www.1011now.com/home/headlines/School-District-Says-Deaf-Student-Not-Required-to-Change-Name-167784235.html)\s\sThe issue has been resolved.Due to political pressure. The crazies are still there.So a 3 year old child making a symbol that barely resembles a gun shaped device is offensive and must not be allowed in school but boys are allowed to dress up as girls and it doesn't matter if anyone finds that offensive?\s\sWe need to stop children from being allowed to promote violence even if they only think they are saying their name.  Next thing you know he'll be robbing banks with unlimited bullets and perfect concealability.  Clearly such a dangerous futuristic weapon shouldn't be allowed in the hand of a three year old deaf child.What the fuck? Does the school board not have anything better to do? Why are they all saying things like ""I find it most difficult to believe..."".\sTell it like it is people!  For example I might say ""this is the most fucking stupid load of utter shite I have ever heard of and my faith in humanity has completely evaporated"".Just when you think stupid has reached full bloom along comes a story like this and a new never before reached level of stupidity is achieved; and by those in charge of educating our children. I grew up in a town with a whole family named ""Hunter"".Can't we have some rule about stupidity and then kick out these administrators for violating that rule?Wow. Raise your hand if you think that's some bullshit. *raises hand*Okay. I guess every time I see a cop point a finger at me I'll press charges for being threatened with a deadly weapon. We'll see how far down the rabbit hole the double-standard goes.""Zero Tolerance"" just a nice way to say INTOLERANCE...Wow robotics is further along than I thought.I thought it was the kids that were supposed to be immature. This is ridiculous.Well just when I thought good ole GI couldn't get any more idiotic .Oh shit! He's going to kill us with weapon-like fingers! He should be arrested for even thinking his name.Those school officials are fucking imbecilic weirdos.  \s  \sI'd find a different school. One without idiots who make decisions like this.I am now sorry that I didn't name any of my children Bomber or Explosive but then again we would never get through an airport....I'm not a big fan of guns. That said this is fucking ridiculous.\s\s...Yeah that's all I got.Poor kid. Deaf students can have a horrible time at school depending on where they attend. My little brother was born completely deaf and I remember his hearing impaired teacher refusing to let any of the deaf students attempt to speak on the grounds that it sounded ""weird"" to other students in class. I can't imagine how that little boy might feel being denied saying his own name.As a Deaf person who went through a cluster school (where Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing students are mainstreamed with hearing students in a public school) I can tell you right now that the teacher your little brother was assigned to should have been reported.  Refusing to let a D/HH student use their own voice only inhibits the learning process further and they're already inhibited in many ways due to language barriers.I think you mean ""deaf"" not ""dead."" sorry I'm not usually a grammar nazi but this is a typo that countsThe kid and his family will absolutely win this.  Not only is this a case of serious overreacting but I would assume it's also pretty offensive to the Deaf community. In short they're pissing off a whole lot of people.Pfff. Banning hand gestures that could be interpreted to resemble firearms? Only in Britain.NIope Nebraska. http://www.gips.orgI don't know what is funnier the episode of Aqua Teen I watched earlier or this article. What a horrible situation for this poor little kid. It's sad that finger pistols are deadly weapons nowadays. Wow this just goes to prove that we have too many opinions in our country. We have become too soft allowing stuff like this to happen. If something like this even came up 30 years ago no one would have had a second though on it. It makes me sad.I'm going to have a child and name him Colt.  $1000000000000000000000000.00 says theyd have zero issue with that.  Of if you have twins name them Smith and Wesson.THIS... is fucking ridiculous! That looks like a gun? If I saw a kid doing that in school then I would think that he is hoping for an A on his spelling test or really anything *but* planning mass murder.this kinda belongs in r/wtf =/\sRidiculous. This is terrible. Deaf part is irrelevant. My best friend's name is Hunter and if he would have had to do this when we were in school I would have made a fuss about it as a kid in school with him...Scary how many people are blind policy-enforcing drones applying absolutely zero wisdom or consideration in their jobs.I honestly thought this was an Onion article when I read it.  This is pretty stupid.What the fuck? What is society turning into? I remember when I would bring knives to school and no one would care. I even wore and wear pro gun shirts (*gasp*) to school and no one cares. WTF IS THIS SHIT?? when i was in elementary school me and my friends brought army outfits to school kept them in our cubbys then played army during fucking recess. And the teachers could give a fuck less my mom bought me a helmet from WWII and i brought it once and my teachers thought it was the coolest shit ever. Fucking schools now a days. Btw im only 15 so this wasn't ALL that long agoOhh gun control advocates vs kids.  This should be interesting.This is why other countries think America is the dumbest country. And they're right. I can think of plenty of other countries that would probably piss themselves way harder over a kid having a vaguely gun-related name than these crazies in America. Hand-wringers and stupid people are *everywhere.*Change the sign to a middle finger.WOW I expected this to come out of a liberal state but NEBRASKA?  This has to be the most ridiculous politicly correct story I have ever seen and there have been some doozies!  I hope those administrators that are pushing this not only get smacked down for being dumbshits but are looking for a new job in another field that has nothing to do with common sense..  One does not simply change their name sign. One does not simply give themselves their name sign. Your name sign is pretty much yours forever.\s\sMine is simple because a 7 year old gave it to me but I would never change it out of respect for the fact he gave it to me.Because this three year old is most certainly going to carry a gun on to campus and shoot people. The administrating staff of these schools are becoming more and more stupid. I mean... really; you're going to ban sign language because one letter(?) looks like a gun? I am loosing my faith in humanityShakespeare said ""What's in name""Oh my Science! TIL once again you don't need to put a rover on Mars to still be a messed up country. So I'll jump in and interrupt the ""hurr durr stupid teachers"" circlejerk for a moment and suggest that yes this is stupid.  But its probably born of some other policy like a ban on making ""gang signs"" or ""threatening gestures"" or some such thing and the teacher is forced to report it to school admins under some ""report or you're fired"" policy who then take things too far.  There are policies like this in nearly every school district and frustration lies among teachers and parents alike.  This is probably not a case of ""stupid teachers.""  Their hands are most likely tied.>Their hands are most likely tied.\s\sOh the irony... being as that we are talking about a deaf child using international SIGN LANGUAGE.... **NOT** gang signals.  He is 3 years old... what gang would he be a member of?  No amount of explanation will dilute how STUPID this is.>This is probably not a case of ""stupid teachers."" \s\sThe alternative is that it is a case of teachers who are too fucking cowardly to stand up call this policy stupid and refuse to enforce it.  That would make them even more pathetic IMNSHO.Did you even read the article? It says the weapons rule for the school states that ""any instrument...that looks like a weapon"" is banned. Who would ever construe that to mean a child's fingers when signing his name?\s> This is probably not a case of ""stupid teachers."" Their hands are most likely tied.\s\sThat might be the same thing.I wish I could up-vote this some more. It's absolutely true- teachers by and large don't set these stupid policies but they do have to abide by them or risk their jobs.\s\sThat's not necessarily what happened here but it's definitely worth noting.I don't know why you're being downvoted you're absolutely right. These sorts of policies are created by idiots for idiotic reasons and teachers who fail to enforce them are punished. \s\s[deleted]i was expecting [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqQpRZxapIg&t=2m53s)HEY COOL NEWS STORY FRIEND. WAIT THIS ISN'T /R/NEWS WHAT IS THIS DOING HERE? I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE LOST LET ME HELP YOU OUT; /R/NEWS IS OVER THERE ---->Per the page tab header ""guns.reddit.com:Firearms and related articles""\s\sLooks like the article is related to guns so go clean the sand out of your vagina and quit crying.Go away.America is the scariest neighbor to have.I always thought hunter was a terrible name for a kid or even adult.  Some parents are morons.  Also if you're a parent that did that then shame on you.  Rare percentage of people in the world that take on the nick name of Hunter willingly. The best quote by far I've heard about this:\s\sThe ATF is a bunch of arsonists posing as firemen.A friend of mine was in federal law enforcement for a long long time. He said: ""I've met DEA agents that weren't crooked or idiots. I can't say the same about the ATF"".Awesome I'm re-using this.Have you ever read Farhenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury? Wow CBS is actually commenting on this. This is a HUGE scandal. Our gOvernment deliberately destabilized an ally to push for infringement of our constitution at home. \s\sHow come there's not a trial? People should be in jail for this. No impeachment hearing or anything? This is way worse than getting a blowjob from an intern. Actually CBS has been pushing this issue almost from the beginning.  Sharyl Attkisson deserves a lot of credit for doing her best to get mainstream exposure for a story the rest of the media doesn't want to touch.[deleted]This is how federal agencies work; they create an artificial threat then rush in to ""save us"" from the non-existent threat then lobby for a bigger budget.This might seem like an underwhelming comment but this should serve as a major example of why we need to restructure how we fund federal agencies.  An agency's number one unstated goal is to protect its own existence.  If the AFT does too good a job and stamp out all firearms violations they will loose funding and their jobs.  If the DEA were to eradicate the drug trade the DEA would go away.  We as a country need to guide our government into a model where the government actually provides needed ongoing valuable service to the populace and not mere ""War on <flavor of the day>"" approaches to every problem.I've never heard it put quite that way and I think you're right. I think it would be one hell of a battle to implement that model but nothing's impossible. I feel more and more like we as a country are on the precipice of sweeping political change though we're probably miles from the edge.This is why Police are more interested in handing out speeding tickets than catching criminals. The justification for their existence comes from having criminals around. The funding comes from speeders.As anyone with a basic knowledge of economics knows everything is run by incentives. We create incentives for agencies to create crimes instead of solving them and they do. We create incentives for corporations to buy off congressmen and they do. We create incentives for cops to ticket instead of prevent crime and they do.\s\sCorruption is like living things; if there is any possible way to carve out a niche it will. You simply cannot have a group of human beings granted power over other groups of human beings without creating incentive for abuse.Nah. That assumes it is possible for an issue to completely go away.\s\sThis is a over sight issue as well as an issue with not enough transparency.\sWho are the AFT?Why this isn't making a bigger stink on the news networks is just a sign of how it seems the govt controls media. I know how bad that sounds but I remember when the news reported on all kinds of govt scandals but ever since 11 SEPT 2001 things have gone downhill even faster than the previous 50 years.The government revokes the 4th amendment with NDAA and gets caught giving guns and money to Mexican drug cartels in order to crack down on the 2nd amendment back at home and the top story on CNN is an interview with Sanjay Gupta about how he hasn't cried since he was little.  Well Sanjay I'm crying right now.\s\shttp://www.cnn.com/video/?hpt=hp_c1#/video/bestoftv/2011/12/07/orig-jtb-red-chair-gupta.cnn\s\sI see where you're coming from but i don't see it as a government conspiracy in the news media i see it as the news media doing what gets them ratings.  There are very few of the old fashion reporters reporting on the big news stories because the american people would rather see a gorgeous blond with large assets talking about nothing that needs to make them think.  And this comes as a surprise to anyone? More regulation is what it's been about the entire time. What do you think ""under the radar"" meant?We all KNEW that was the goal just shocked that now there's proofI knew something was up when Obama and Holder started flapping their worthless gums about Mexico about a week after Obama took office.\s\sI also suspect their plan B is the UN small arms treaty.Underhanded dealings and destabilizing a neighbor and major trading partner at least have the advantage of not being as visible as trying to push bullshit legislation through congress.  If I were the president of Mexico I'd be thinking of ways to retaliate such as finding a way to make the oil they export to the US more expensive.Or calling for Holders head(which i think he already has?)Or the drugs and labor cheaper?Almost makes my eyes well up. This is a gun dealer telling the ATF he is worried about the sales they are telling him to make:\s\s> Two months later the same gun dealer grew more agitated.  \s\s> ""I wanted to make sure that none of the firearms that were sold per our conversation with you and various ATF agents could or would ever end up south of the border or in the hands of the bad guys. I guess I am looking for a bit of reassurance that the guns are not getting south or in the wrong hands...I want to help ATF with its investigation but not at the risk of agents (sic) safety because I have some very close friends that are US Border Patrol agents in southern AZ as well as my concern for all the agents (sic) safety that protect our country."" Remember when [this deuchebag](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/gun-nuts-in-a-rut/) asserted that ""Gun Nuts"" were ""Conspiracy Theorists"" thinking the ATF was trying to use F&F to shape gun regulations?\s\sSomeone should make him publicly apologize.The worst part is that's the official line.  That's how they justified it up the food chain when in fact they were smuggling guns because drug cartels will give you tons of drugs and cash for guns.  We live in a world where the basis for our societies foundation is based off how things went in fictional stories...Remember Waco? That was just the ATF trying to justify its existence.\s\sThis is just pathetic gun haters stooping to new lows.It'd make more sense if the headline was ""ATF used 'Fast and Furious' to make the case for installing Nitrous boosters and LED underbody lights in their Honda Civics""?o forgot racing stripes they make your car go fasterSuch. Bullshit.[NRA President Wayne LaPierre made this call 2 months ago](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-20110766-10391695.html)\s\sJust sayin...He wrote a great piece in the most recent issue of American Rifleman discussing how this operation was always just one big plan to regulate guns.Time to get rid of the ATF Holder and Obama I'm a bit confused the article says that the ATF _discussed_ using Fast and Furious to make a case for gun regulations but the title says that they did it.\s\sWhich is it?Lemme break it down for ya man. \s\sSo the Brady Bunch donated a grip of cash to Obama during his presidential campaign. He gets into office they expect some return on investment. \s\sA crazy white boy who's one bad haircut and a one armed leather jacket away from bein' the damn Kurgan shoots up a crowd in Arizona and almost kills a US congresswoman. \s\sThem Brady's is a buncha blood dancers so they start all hootin' an hollerin' for more gun control laws. Screamin' about ""high capacity magazines"" like they went out all by theyselves and shot all those people. \s\sThings otherwise from gun control ain't lookin' so peachy for their boy Obama so he figures I'll throw em a bone but all low key like so as not to piss off an even larger chunk of his potential voters dig?\s\sSo he writes ol Sarah a letter all sweet talkin' and jivin like. Tells her not to get her panties in a bunch 'cause him and his boys are workin' on the whole gun control thing all on the down low like. \s\sRound about this time all the sudden you got people spoutin' off about how 90% of the guns in Mexico are comin' from the US. Now this is jus' a bit of the good ol' Illinois shuffle. The numbers just don't match up. Along comes the ATF tellin' America that if they just have the power to demand that gun dealers have to report when some law abiding US citizen buys more than one rifle in 10 days they can stop those 90% of the guns that are supposedly flowin' to Mexico from lawful purchases in the US ('cause we all know criminals buy their guns legally amirite?).\s\sNow at the same time the ATF is busy rulin' that certain shotguns aren't importable 'cause they have no ""sportin' purpose"" like George Washington crossed the Delaware river to get to his duck blind or some shit. They're also sayin' a buncha other dumb shit like air soft guns is really machine guns 'cause some egghead motherfucker was able to alter one to fire a real bullet (I wanna see video of that shit) among other shit. \s\sAlso at the same time the ATF is runnin' guns into Mexico. Now CBS come along with their FOIA request turns out that we got the ATF having conversations about how to use the same gun runnin' scheme to back their demand for illegal reporting of rifle sales. \s\sWe also have a couple of them new dangled bloggers discoverin' that the Attorney General has been lyin' his ass off to congress about that gun runnin' operation. \s\sThese same guys have uncovered evidence that many others in the administration knew about the gun runnin'.\s\sNow do *you* think all that added up doesn't add up to ""under the radar"" gun control? It jus' don't make sense man. If you push for regulations using numbers influenced by F&F did Fast & Furious and discussed using Fast & Furious to make the case for regulations I'd say that you did it.No this just is not true. This is crazy conspiracy talk by the Obama haters... Oh wait it has been true all along. Decisions like these flow from the TOP down. Just sayin'.I wouldn't put it on Obama's head mostly Holders.  None of the current evidence points to the president and in a land where you are innocent until proven guilty I refrain from accusing the president of concocting this mess.  Now that being said Holder needs to face trail and this entire thing needs to be brought to light with all players revealed so we can fire the whole damn bunch of them.Shit if you ask me this is proof 9/11 couldn't have been an inside job. Our government is so pitifully incompetent that they couldn't even manage simple ""gun terrorism"" to get regulations they wanted passed.\s\sSorry tangent.\s\sBut seriously they all deserve to be in jail.But Obama doesn't want to take away our guns. He hasn't proposed a single gun regulation. Of course he does appoint regulators who want to take away guns and he does nothing to reign them in. Why try and pass a law when a Czar/Cabinet member/Regulator can effectively institute what you want anyway?"
0,AnythingGoesNews,moderatepolitics,46,"It's in the interest of the NSA to justify surveillance. So I don't find it at all surprising that they are using 9/11 as one of their ways to do so. Now whether or not the extent of their surveillance is necessary to prevent future 9/11s is certainly debatable but I don't find this to be surprising at all.That's exactly what I was thinking just reading the headline here. ""[rather] than explaining another 9/11 event that we were not able to prevent."" actually is a perfectly reasonable explanation too.\s\sWe actually *should* be debating whether or not such surveillance can prevent another 9/11 event in my opinion.I agree. This is not remotely surprising and is not evidence of the NSA secretly trying to control everyone on the planet.\s\sMy personal belief is that the NSA's mission _most likely_ really is to protect American citizens from more terrorist attacks and I really think that that is _most likely_ Obama's goal as well. My concern with these surveillance systems is how they might be misused in 20 or 30 years after several rounds of administrators and operators have come and gone.9/11 was the justification for the Patriot Act so this naturally follows from their perspective. I don't know why anyone would be surprised at this.I have to say I don't find this all that remarkable. What am I missing? Seems more ""good day to bury bad news"" than conspiracy fuel.[removed]gotta love how page 6 of that .pdf given to al jazeera says ""the NSA is commited to transparency""  [removed]The article isn't about how 9/11 was planned so the NSA could spy on people...There are only 6 people on this subreddit right now. What are you expecting?I think I should know better than to ask but what is memory holing?When Bush was elected my environmentalist friends were all upset and concerned about doom and gloom with the environment. Instead without Clinton environmental groups (aka mostly Democratic partisans) were now free to openly fight the president and did so with gusto. The environment became more and more important in the public's mind and we accomplished more than we would have if a Democrat had been in office.\s\sFor the same reasons the only way to get what the Republicans wanted (Welfare reform and debt reduction) was to have a Democrat as president. \s\sSometimes winning means losing in politics. You need someone to fight in order to get what you want accomplished. Without a boogeyman liberal groups are struggling. In my opinion that was the biggest downfall of the Occupy movement. Without the ability to attack the president congress or most city mayors they were just beating their heads against the wall. They needed someone to protest that actually cared they were protesting.  Wall Street could care less what they thought. And most people support the police.I remember in 2008 my senior  year of college anticipating this in some of the activist groups I was involved with at the time. \s\sI basically said ""Suppose that Obama wins this election. What should our strategy be? What approach should we have?"" Unfortunately the group was dominated by anarchists who somehow thought that not acknowledging the existence of elections accomplished something and so I was ignored. \s\sI'm at a less idealistic phase right now (that was sort of my last gasp) so I'm not sure what if anything can be done about this phenomena but I think the Occupy movement did accomplish something. Has anyone been paying attention to some of the Republican debates and the tone of them? It was to the movement's credit that while it may have not spent much time criticizing the president it never came off as a Democratic campaign rally the way the 2006 anti-war protests did. \s\sIn this respect it may be more helpful to have a Democrat in the White House than it might appear.This is an amazing point. Very very rarely I learn something new from political opinons / comments the rate is around 1 : 1000. This was the 1. Thank you.Apologies for the title but the rules of /r/moderatepolitics required me to use the author's editorialized title.""Repulsive hypocracy."" [Like Greenwald's own?](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/02/repulsive-greenwald-hypocrisy.html)\s\s[And more](http://socfools.blogspot.com/2008/05/illegal-wiretapping-indeed.html)I think the critical thing to know for all of these cases is what information they had available to them that the general public wasn't aware of. As soon as the answer is anything but ""nothing"" it seems like a pretty clear violation of the STOCK act. On a non-legal front this is also super sketchy in appearance. \s\sThat being said many people use financial advisors who have the authority to buy and sell securities on behalf of their clients based on their own knowledge. There seems to have been a good share of that happening during the same timeframe so it could have been relatively innocent for some of these congressional members. This is a great argument for a blind trust requirement for all elected officials at this level.Is a blind trust a magic bullet for this? \s\sBecause I’m wondering how the ‘blind’ part is actually ensured or enforced? It could easily just be my ignorance but it seems like it would be pretty easy for an elected official to give direction to the “independent” manager of the trust on the sly. And wouldn’t that negate the conflict-of-interest-prevention that the blind trust is for?\s\sTake the Feinstein example:\s\s>“All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust” a spokesman Tom Mentzer said in a statement. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.”\s\sThat seems to imply that her husband is the trustee for her blind trust right? How could that blind trust arrangement (if that is in fact the case) prevent conflicts of interest? All she has to do is say over dinner “So we got briefed on that coronavirus thing today and it’s gonna get bad. Maybe you should dump those biotech stocks you were iffy about.”Its only clear if you are just reading the headlines or partisan media. It is much more nuanced when you actually look at there sales amounts  and dates.Agreed. I dumped everything too and I don't have insider information.>	it seems like a pretty clear violation of the STOCK act\s\sI’m pretty sure Congress watered down the STOCK act just before it passed. I’ll have to read up on it but I thought it just required disclosure within 45 days and any “violations” could be referred to the ethics committee. Basically they police themselves and that’s it. There’s no real teeth to it.Late February selling is much different than a few hours after a private briefing on February 12th and then going out to tell the American people not to worry everything was under control as Senator Burr did.\s\sSen. Kelly Loeffler GA made a business decision that her cash was more important than her Senate seat. \s\sShe was appointed recently has never won a single  political race of any kind and was unlikely to win the Republican primary. I assume now she will just step down.[deleted]As I understand the Stock Act was repealed in 2013~The mere act of making a dramatic sell off at a particular time though is evidence for the relevant knowledge.  It's not conclusive in all cases but statistical analysis can give large confidence intervals based purely on stock movement history.  Imagine your investments are distributed in the in-person service economy for ten years with no movement and then just this last month you sold it all and moved it into respiratory medical supplies.  There is just no way this is mere coincidence.  \s\sMore technical regression time-series and ANOVA methods can separate some cases that appear less obvious before analysis.  It can use the investment movements by investors who very likely did not have insider information as a control.SS: Senators faced a massive scandal on Thursday after multiple members revealed in public filings that they had sold large stock holdings after private briefings on the coronavirus outbreak. Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and  Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) have both been implicated in the scandal. Now conservative Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe has also been caught up after reporting he sold in late February. The GOP senators along with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California all dumped their stocks shortly after attending a classified Senate briefing on the threat of the novel coronavirus.\s\sNote: Not happy with how the headline almost excludes Democrats and then Feinstein gets a blurb at the bottom. This is about the corruption of rich public servants.Fox News headline talks about Feinstein and almost leaves out republicans.  Maybe if you read both you'd get something balanced out of the deal? :DWhat's also interesting Is Dianne Feinstein and her husband have made millions convincing companies to set up shop in China the market is down due to the supply chain going to hell a supply chain she helped move from the US to China.\s\sHer driver was found to be a Chinese spy and funnily enough nothing happened.\shttps://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/08/01/details-chinese-spy-dianne-feinstein-san-francisco/You're just bitter you couldn't sell your $500000 in stock.Maybe senators should put their holdings into a blind trust like presidents are supposed toSeems like Feinstein did have a blind trust and maybe Loeffler?Hypothetically speaking:\s\sIt's late January and I'm a Senator. Everybody is talking about the ""Wuhan virus"". The first case was detected in the US a week earlier and it's important enough that the Senate has a meeting to make sure that everyone's paying attention to the daily CDC reports. And based on all this public information I decide I'd rather have my money in cash.\s\s**What am I allowed to do?** Don't tell me ""don't have stock in the first place"" because that's not the rule. Maybe it should be but it isn't.I recently learned that Biden has never had any stock investments for this exact reason interestingly.I don't know. I'm kind of an extremist on corruption. \s\sI think if people are going to publicly serve (especially in federal positions) they should have to place their wealth into blind trusts that are tied to average wages in the country (or some other long-term wellness indicator). \s\sI think it used to be more true that politicians were worried about the appearance of impropriety just as much as impropriety itself. Now I hear hints of ""you can't prove it"" in all the public statements made by these folks.Sell your stock and issue a statement. \s\s""I am selling X shares or $XYZ stock because of my fear that the virus currently contained to Wuhan China will eventually spread to the United States and have a negative effect on this stock's performance.""Well one thing to consider is these people all received more information than the general public and in many cases were actively making statements at that time which we now know were contradictory to the information they were receiving.This is exactly the point of blind trusts.When I worked for one of the big 4 audit firms I was mid level at best. Yet even then I was required to divest myself from any and all investments that could in any fathomable way present a conflict of interest. \s\sThe firm spends a lot of time and money ensuring that nobody has these conflicts of interest because the legal and criminal ramifications are huge. \s\sI know this isn’t an exact answer to your question but the fact is that we hold private companies and people to this high standard and they find a way.I have a reform. \s\sIf your in Congress you can own no stocks.\s\sYour spouse can own no stocks.\s\sYou get elected all stocks must immediately be divested.\s\sDon't like it?  -  Don't run.Or put all your assets in a blind trust.So you want to ban small business owners from Congress?What about just freezing activity? Then they can sell it all if they don’t like taking the risk. Or they can hang onto it and live with the consequences. \s\sOr we can prosecute these people to the fullest extent of the law to deter this kind of activity. \s\sAlso make their trading activity public information.[This is illegal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78u-1)\s\s> ** 15 U.S. Code § 78u–1.

And I’m not sure what the standard is for having to prove criminal intent (if anyone knows?)Didn't congress conveniently exempt themselves from this again.What material nonpublic information did they process?Lol? Congress is exempt from insider trading............So you will agree with me that any government official should be investigated if their personal net worth increases thanks to a suspiciously timed stock transaction due to potential insider information?Absolutely. We’ve given far too much benefit of the doubt for far too long on personal enrichment via public office. And stocks are just one place for here shenanigans can occur. \s\sIn my home state a senator advocated for the shut down of all state homes for the mentally delinquent only for it to come out later that he was the winning bidder for a series of rental apartments to house them. With the state paying the rent obviously. \s\sHe is still a wealthy man and lobbyist for privitazation.So what actually happens now? Who is responsible for figuring out in detail what laws were broken and prosecuting? Will that actually happen?Senate ethics committee chaired by Republican James Lankford.\s\sNothing is likely to happen.Matt Levine's take on this. Execedingly moderate and well thought out.\s\shttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/senators-picked-a-good-time-to-sell-stocks\s\sBasically Burr seems to be fishy because of the size of his trades.\s\sLoeffler/Sprecher seems above board (it was a tiny amount compared to their overall portfolio and network and it was indicative of past trades in terms of size - doesn't really seem like what somebody would do with insider trading when they knew something big was going to happen and they didn't even play the big names but some small companies that clearly weren't going to be the front runners).\s\sInhofe is worth $8mm+. and his was in the range of $180000 to $400000 at most. Not what you would call dumping your portfolio. Every one of those started to fall 2 weeks before he made his trades. DRH hasn't even dropped as much as the wider market (less than 20%). It isn't even clear why DHR would be a virus short.\s\sI wonder what the rest of his porfolio is? Does he have other financial stocks that he didn't sell? If he was insider trading he was doing a bad job at it. This just seems like selling after the markets started to fall.I think it’s absurd we even need to ask these questions. \s\sA senator occupies a position of extreme power within our society. \s\sSuch a privilege IMO should demand a complete subservience of personal interest to the public interest. \s\sEven the appearance of impropriety shouldn’t be acceptable. \s\sHis assets should long ago have been sold or in a private trust.Insider trading. Both by republicans and democrats. Politicians dont actually give a fuck about you they'll bitch and moan at each other on screen then behind closed doors their all jerking each other off[deleted]>My dad lost 15 percent of his life's earnings just 1.5 years away from retirement\s\sThe market is down 30%. This implies that your dad has 50% of his lifetime earnings invested in equities 18 months before his retirement. Your dad needs to fire whoever is giving him financial advice immediately. \s\sAll that said the market is where it was in 2016. If he's been investing for a long time his long term ROI should still be very good.>I feel anyone who has a significant amount of money in the market can understand why these near-retirement Senators pulled their money out\s\sOf course we understand why they would do it but that's the whole reason we created laws about insider trading in the first place. People can't be expected to sacrifice their own wealth to help others but they can be expected to refrain from commiting crimes that hurt others for their own financial gain.\s\s>how can we say that our representatives can't hold stocks or indexes to accumulate wealth when the rest of us have that right?\s\sI don't think anyone reasonable wants that. We just want those who have power to not be allowed to abuse that power so they can gain at the expense of everyone else. That's why some other commenters are advocating things like a blind trust so they are effectively separated from their investments while in office. \s\s>At the end of the day there are two cases; one is not pulling your money out when you suspect a dip (in this case a crater) to happen and you lose hundreds of thousands of dollars or do people want the people in the highest level of authority to signal to everyone to sell everything and crash the markets?\s\sIf you suspect a dip due to information that everyone has then that's just trying to be smart. If you suspect a dip because of information that only a select few are privy to then you have to bite the bullet until that information goes public. It has to go public at some point and it will hurt the market but the select few dumping their stock hurts the market just as much and hurts everyone who didn't have that information. By doing this they are realing all the benefit of investing while avoiding the inherent risk of investments.Someone else made this point elsewhere but I am a very low level associate for a law firm. Any securities transaction I make needs to be cleared by the conflicts department to make sure that the firm doesn’t have inside information about the stocks I am buying/selling. If they do the firm could be subject to massive insider trading penalties and/or forced to drop the client whose stock I bought. \s\sThese senators had a classified briefing on the potential impact of this virus then turned around and told the public that everything would be fine while privately preparing for a crash. \s\sIf they don’t feel the information was appropriate to share with the public then it absolutely was inappropriate for them to us it to inform investment strategies. These people are not your dad they have top level security clearances to get information only a handful of people have access to. If your dad sold stocks based off that kind of inside information he would go to prison.Good thing you must not worry about your personal finances so much given that you're such a socialist... posting during work hours and all and socializing that workload.I wholly believe more names are going to be blasted out in the coming days.  It’s important to remember that most everyone who has investment portfolios don’t manage those themselves. Most are blind trust or have 2d and 3d party managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the portfolio owners.  Does it look shady? Sure...but intentionally malicious? I’m not quite there yet.Are you kidding me?  Richard Burr is estimated to be worth 1.7M.  He sold off 1.5M worth of stocks in the last month.Same here.  The market started dropping on the 21st.  The meeting was on the 24th.  By then it was clear stocks were becoming unstable.  I was wary by then too and I am not too involved.\s\sEdit:  hold on... was the meeting February 24th or January 24th?  I’m seeing conflicting timelines.Bad but no mention of Feinstein and her $2M to $6M in sales prior to drop?It mentions it. But doesn't provide enough info.Burr and Loeffler are the real criminals here.  Inofe was likely just a victim of bad timing.  From NYT:\s\s> Inhofe’s transactions were part of a systematic selling of stocks that he started after he became chairman of the Armed Services Committee.From my reading Feinstein is similarly innocent. Regardless - I think we could use a national conversation about wealth and representatives.Isn’t this the asshat who tried to claim global warming wasn’t a thing by holding a snowball in the Senate House ... during February?!?He's a particularly outspoken detractor of belief in climate change.One and the same!The government is corrupt beyond belief they don't care about usThis could be solved easily.  I say legislators should not be able to own stocks in any capacity period. I'd go so far as to say their only source of income / revenue should only be their congressional salaries. That's just my 2 cents though and I imagine there are probably things wrong with such a simplistic idea but people should go into legislature with the intentions of helping the public not getting rich.I think that maybe a little extreme. The immediate issue I see is retirement income or lack thereof for members of Congress under your proposal.Holla at my boy u/el_muchacho_loco who didn’t think this was a problem when Burr was the only one publicly outed. \s\sStill want to condescend champ?Take this to private messages.I didn't condescend - I provided context.

I look forward to seeing it.SS: \sSoon after he offered public assurances that the government was ready to battle the coronavirus the powerful chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Richard Burr sold off a significant percentage of his stocks unloading between $582029 and $1.56 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 29 separate transactions.\s\sAs the head of the intelligence committee Burr a North Carolina Republican has access to the government’s most highly classified information about threats to America’s security. His committee was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time according to a Reuters story.\s\sA week after Burr’s sales the stock market began a sharp decline and has lost about 30% since.I think a really important context to this is that he was privately raising a lot of alarm about the virus at a private luncheon he attended as per recording obtained by NPR here  [https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192535/burr-recording-sparks-questions-about-private-comments-on-covid-19](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192535/burr-recording-sparks-questions-about-private-comments-on-covid-19)   \s\s\sThough he sold the stock on Feb 13th at was raising the alarm on Feb 27.

Nope because they’re all complicit in these ridiculous actions. \s\sBastions of free speech if you ask me! /sYup. I can’t stand r/conspiracy anymore. It has become a Trumper circle jerk unfortunately.What's needed is regime change. ""Antlers Peehole"" needs to be removed and booted from Reddit.Aleister is one shady dude!Literally just got banned for saying [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jkw5rs/tucker_carlson_suddenly_says_its_time_to_leave/galpe4c/?context=3) by this [mod](https://www.reddit.com/user/axolotl_peyotl/posts/).

I'm guessing he's boss mod and even on r/conspiracyfact. They've become puppets.Yeah ""Antlers Peehole"" already deleted your post.  He's been a pawn of the right for many years.2020 Deposition:\s\sAre you a citizen of the U.S.? Yes.\s\sAre you a citizen of England? Yes.\s\sAre you a citizen of any other land? Yes TarraMar.\s\sLook into the Terramar Project. It is an interesting rabbit hole.That is really weird. $1BN from Ted Turner!any links or sources worth checking out?The logo looks like someone spreading there legsNever forget Maxwell is not a hero here. Don’t let these quotes make you think she’s one of the good guys she’s an absolute rotten vermin who manipulated the girls on the basis that she’s a woman and she “understands” them. \sShe was the rat behind the whole operationMaxwell is the epitome of the phrase ""gender traitor"". So many vulnerable girls assume that older women will look out for their best interests because they too have suffered but are more knowledgeable and experienced. It seems Maxwell decided to use that knowledge and experience for her own sick pleasure and personal gain. Fuck her.its not a person or party its systemic. this is a hidden empire of blackmail and corruption that plays us for fools with their games of divide and conquer. fuck marx. but he was right about the oligarchy and their systems of direct and indirect control.Epstein=intelligence and elite blackmail assetI agree this goes way deeper than anyone realizesfuck marx 😩This isn't even a conspiracy theory it's an obvious fact by now. We have the records Trump's statement about liking girls as young as Epstein did Clinton on their jet. The human trafficking crisis itself. I know that in a court of law they will need the solid proof but everyone who doesn't have their brain stuck in Trump's ass knows. I truly hope Epstein is still alive somewhere and gets apprehended and dragged in front of a court but I guess that he was murdered for knowing too much. Which means there are more like him possibly countless. I hope the court will make one hell of an example out of Ghislaine.Were the jet logs that were released true and accurate? I only ask because I wonder about other celebs said to me on them. I know they said Clinton was on them like 20 timesTrump is the one that had Epstien busted out of jail and then had his face changeddid you know that about a month after Epstien ""Killed himself"" his very close plastic surgeon friend died mysteriously? Or how about Trump wishing Ghilene Maxwell ""The Best"" when asked about her upcoming hearing.I remember the pictures of Jeffreys corpse coming out around the time he died. Wouldn’t it be hard to fake those photos?Trump didn't say that. He said he DIDN'T like them as young as Epstein meaning he liked his of legal ageUh oh dude you don’t want to be labeled a q anon conspiracy theorist do you?????No one gets to high office without some sort of compromising dirt on them. You know just in case they start to get smart and actually do good things.\s\sJFK almost did irreparable damage but they got him before he could. They will never repeat this mistake again.The last person who successfully survived that kind of treatment was Andrew Jackson. They tried to murder him several times and he was still able to shut down the federal reserve. Don’t look into any patterns about who is behind the federal reserve though because you’ll get ad hominem thrown at you and all discussion stops.Yep and it’s not just that - it’s so they don’t step out of line. Been done in gangs and the mafia for ages. Shit ever watch Training Day? Yeah it’s a movie but same concept.**https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/3/13501364/trump-rape-13-year-old-lawsuit-katie-johnson-allegation**'I want the tapes. I know he [Epstein] was videotaping everyone and I want the tapes of Trump with the girls' Rosen told her. \s\sWhat makes Trump any more of an innocent man than Epstien then if we were to assume Trump was taking full advantage of his pedophile buddy's ring?He’s not. People have just fallen prey to idiotic propagandaWas really weird hearing Trump ""Wish her the best"" she was involved in a HUGE fucking pee dough sex trafficking ring. Why TF are you wishing her anything good? IDK man because then I think to how Trump was investigated by the biggest most powerful investigative agencies in the US for 2.5 years and his entire family toobut they found NOTHING? Keep in mind the agencies investigating him wanted his head on a silver platteror did they? Was it all just one big show? The entire past 4.5 years? Trump playing his role in the scriptClinton and the rest of them playing their roll as well with the power of the MSM.If you ever look up a montage of trump 'wishing the best' to people you'll see that it's not necessarily to his friends“Enjoy the show” was a Q catchphrase for Qtards.  IMO it was/is absolutely scripted look at how much division they’ve created and continue to create.I really agree with you. If there was anything even remotely illegal they would have put it out there quickly. I don’t see how they wouldn’t have. Like you said they were digging for dirt the minute he was elected![deleted]Get your tongue out his ass lmaoDude has a weird shaped dome piecewell Dailymail is about just as reliable a Chinese Watch.DailyFailThis is why Trump said “I wish her well”. She knows where all the tapes are count on that. That’s why she’s alive. I was waiting for Trump to pardon her.Why do you think he's dead?“Did.” Do we tell her? Or should we just let her think he’s dead?Publish all of themWhile I don’t doubt it please remember that we can’t trust this woman with a concept I like to call “The Truth”. She’s a piece of garbage just like the others and I’m not going to chase her delusions.Considering her post on Reddit were super anti trump I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s lying about trump. I say this based off the fact Trump screwed Epstein out of a huge property deal then reported Epstein to the fbi.[removed]They are bona-fide brainwashing victims. Orange bad is now a shiny object to destract their sheep from waking up.Tapes of what?  Trump admitted he knew Epstein and that he banned him from Mar-A-Lago after Epstein tried to get with one of the members' underage daughters.  Basically he was a weirdo so Trump kicked him out.And Trump is also accused of raping one of the girls at one of Epstein's parties. \s\sAnd also flying on the Lolita Express.This article doesn’t present any news and is pretty much suckin the dick of this “Emmy award winning producer”Yeah she wanted to fuck me so bad but I wasn’t gonna serve her the D unless she gave me the tapes. No tapes no dick. Sorry G Max.Then why would Trump give testimony AGAINST Epstein in 2009? Brad Edwards subpoenaed lots of powerful men while he was building his case against Epstein and no one else contacted him EXCEPT Trump.\s\sBlackmailed people don’t give testimony against their blackmailers. That puts a hitch in the narrative.\s\sBTW...the “source” is a reporter.....they don’t have much credibility anymore. Never forget...NBC reporters and Vogue buried stories about Epstein’s proclivities for years 🤷‍♀️Because Trump is and has always been a turncoat coward. It's that simple.\s\sThings like:\s\s*Calls for an insurrection. Tells protesters ""I'll be with you""*\s\s*Goes into hiding then later denounces protesters*\s\sTrump being Trump.yeah was thinking the same thing.  Also even if she did have tapes of Trump and Clinton; not releasing them is weird.  Especially if you wanted Clinton to win.  She could have easily sent the videos anonymously.because trump is an idiot who definitely would give testimony against his blackmailer if he thought it would un-blackmail him which he is also dumb enough to believe.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/23/who-does-trump-wish-well-plenty-people-including-an-accused-spouse-abuser-brutal-dictator-now-ghislaine-maxwell/**FAKE NEWS**\s\sIt's a British tabloid that talks about Epstein's buddies and fails to mention Randy Andy Windsor? Please.Question every source/idea!Aka don't take youtube/ bitchute videos for gospel and actually read the sources they provide (if any). I got a guy at my work that I introduced to some conspiracies. He has went off the deep end and believes everything he hears if it fits his ideology. I approach conspiracies with more of a ""what if"" and ""thats entirely possible"" mind set. Just stay open minded. I tried to teach him that but its a lost cause. I feel bad for introducing him.Conspiracy theories have spilled over into the streets in 2020 just saying....AgreedBut that's the idea you research everything they say and make your own conclusions that's how a true conspiracy theorist does it you research what you are told you look at both sides and you choose the one you believe most2020 the year Facebook Karen's think they are conspiracy theorists but are just propaganda puppetsWhich ones? Maybe there’s some truth to them.Something the qanon crowd might need to think extra hard about.Yea many of them seem to be unaware of what a psy op is and cannot see how badly they are being playedr/conspiracy COMPLETELY FALLS APART if you question ANYTHING they post. You get called a sheep or a bot or a liberal cuck or a trumptard (depending on the post) for not blindly going alone. You get heavily downvoted.\s\sIt's real sad what that sub has became over the last couple years or so.Yup its sad to say but that sub is completely lost. I try to partake here and there and quickly realize what a weird fantasy novel it's been turned into. Even the slightest criticism is met with ""begone shill"" \s\sJust a bunch of political bots echoing the same nonsense into the void. It's become eerily dogmatic and reminds me of taking a walk in jonestown.I posted something really similar to this along with a few others in this thread\s\sWatch in a couple hours someone from that sub will screenshot this thread and say “look at all the shills! They’re spreading misinformation about r/conspiracy! We’re winning!”Unless you dare question the word of \*the\* mod - then you just get banned.Can you share an instance where this happened to you?Fake news. No. Some people post believing it while others show what is real and what is fake. Never was banned for questioningUnless of course you’re in /r/conspiracy.THANK YOU - Came here tired of that sub’s active membership doing just this ^Every day there’s a post in r/conspiracy whining about “shills” which are really just people from r/all coming in and questioning their perspective.\s\sThey’re so paranoid about any person questioning the narrative they push that they’re immediately assumed to be this cambridge analytica Russian Chinese bot farm it’s ridiculous.A lot of people there IMO are just there to either spread their political agenda or to be the first with the “hottest take”. That’s why they get so butthurt when you question their theories. \s\s\sAs someone submitting a theory if your theory falls apart under scrutiny then that’s not other people’s fault. We shouldn’t have to turn a blind eye or tiptoe around plot holes to avoid bruising your ego.If I got paid for every time they’ve called me a shill I’d be loaded.I wish someone would question mine. James Bond was real and controlled our nuclear weapons.I'll bite. Why do you think James Bond is real and controlled nuclear weapons?Username checks outI always see “if you don’t even believe conspiracy theories why are you here???”\s\sI don’t believe *your* conspiracy theories because when scrutinized you say the above sentence rather than an articulation argumentThat’s 100% of the reason I follow this sub.I feel like we had always been questioned or just flat out dismissed. But now everyone believes at least one conspiracy theory and unfortunately a lot of them are dumb as heck. Thanks world wide web for giving people opinions on shit they otherwise wouldn't care about.Ya know what’s funny that I never thought about? People are making it out like Conspiracies are just now  main stream yet the mainstream media went along with the “conspiracy theory” that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction to justify going there and taking all their oil. \s\sAnd then people who called this out were the ones LABELED conspiracy theorists. \s\sWould be funny if it wasn’t so fucked upYes. Now it seems like the news keeps pumping out conspiracy theories instead of the truth. That’s because they no longer abide by the *guideline* that they tell the truth. Now instead of calling out the government for their misdeeds they’re the propaganda machine for the government.Trust no oneI has been scientifically proven that aluminum foil hats actually amplifies radio signals thus making it easier for government mind control transmitters to read your thoughts and take control of your body.\s\sRef: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100708230258/http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/](https://web.archive.org/web/20100708230258/http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/)They are the conspiracy. Always have been. Think about it.  \s\s\sWhere would corporate media be without the zombie army of conspiracy?Real ones live in faraday cagesThis is so true I have always been a theorist but half the conspiracies out there are a bazar book of bullshit.  There is a fine line between conspiracy theorist and critical thinking. It goes both ways so dont believe everything that is told to you.YesYes. Hell yes. Look it up and find information for yourself. Correct my information. THINK! Make me think. Question. Everything.I mean don’t legit question everything cuz it’ll waste all your time there’s no reason to call the earth flat because even if it is it makes no difference. Same for other things that don’t impact you in the slightest.\s\sLike the message some people are dumb and take it too far thoThey don’t like it when you do that on r/conspiracy especially mods there.My internet info is realer than your internet info!!Sometimes I don’t know where to start with people. You know when there is so much stuff people subscribe to as reality? And they just have nothing yet? I get exasperated knowing where to start with themYeah that got me banned in r/conspiracyYou can't question a conspiracy theory because they will show you an edited video with nonsense in it to justify their point.EA Sports: Challenge EverythingAs far as I know some conspiracists are either trying to discredit other theorists or trying to divert theorists by making them focus on empty leads.You should probably also be able to do some level of math and physics.I'm all for this but most people dismiss ""conspiracy theories"" before even bothering looking at any sources. Question the people asking questions yes. But also remember to keep your mind open. It goes both ways.yes! I bloody hope we are all wrong and the world is fine and dandy! please do it! prove us wrong!Shhhhh dont let the CIA think we're into themDefinitely YES! Question EVERYTHING and seek the facts not the opinions.I dId My ReSeArCh By WaTcHiNg A yOuTuBe CrAnK i SuGgEsT yOu Do ThE sAmE yOu ShEeP! yOu WoNt SeE tHaT rEpOrTeD iN tHe MsM!\s\sYes because it's not worth anyone's time. I know people that genuinely believe that the us election will still be overturned in favour of trump. And that the covid epidemic was created to control the population. It doesn't matter when it's pointed out that they live their life through their phone and their every move could be tracked anyway.\s\sI think at the heart of it a lot of the people who peddle this shit are the same. They aren't interesting really and they use the conspiracies to attempt to give their life some more meaning and they have a whole community where they fit in because they don't in normal life. But the government doesn't give a fuck that you have been to subway 4 times this week and watch porn every day.Lol well said! Seems accurate enough.. \\ / .yepMan the good old days when aluminum foil still worked.But actually yesEVERYTHING EVEN HIS""do your own research"" she cried while citing a YouTube video as her one and only source never questioning its sources Don't let the deep state fool you! Never wear a tin foil hat especially one with a pointed tip! You just created an antenna for them to hone in on!!!Skeptics are the most important tool for a conspiracy theorist.  Keeps us grounded.saw a quote that said\s\s“be twice as skeptic of the things you want to believe”Yeah no question everything.""Its the truth!""Question everything. Trust no one.Those who say this haven't reflected on how much we assume and must assume.\s\sSome people also don't know how to research so they don't ask questions properly. An anecdote:  Early this year a couple of worried friends asked me about this story about 5G suffocating you by changing oxygen. It didn't sound right to me so I did a search on ""5G oxygen"" and sure enough the first 20 or so references were dire warnings about kill grids and such. At this point some people would say they've done their research rather than realize the nature of search engines. I ended up reading about molecular physics and speaking to a prof to figure out that the 5G oxygen story was bunk. The whole exercise took weeks of my spare time (this with a science background) while bots somewhere cook up a new story every day. So yeah ""question everything"" is a vapid slogan and a couple of public figures are still flogging the same story to this day.I have multiple feelings about this. Questioning something is one thing. It's another to be defending a mainstream ideas... in a conspiracy sub... relentlessly... without proof!And especially don't trust fact checks that disprove things without actually disproving them. They're just like ""this is misleading information just trust us""It‘s hard to question conspiracy theories when there is so much proof for most of them. But yes I agree. We should always listen to both sides.I disagree that there is much proof for most conspiracies.\s\s90% of the time what you're actually dealing with is a situation which is definitely is sketchy as fuck and there's something going on behind the scenes and then a random grifter shows up with their pet theory points to it and goes ""this is something therefore it is what is going on.""\s\sIn other words just because Person A (who is in charge) is lying doesn't make the first Person B correct just because they disagree.You're confusing proof with conjectureEverythings a lie ! Fuck everything ! Woo !lies!And do you think this bothers those morons over at r/conspiracy? Nope because they’re all complicit in these ridiculous actions. \s\sBastions of free speech if you ask me! /sYup. I can’t stand r/conspiracy anymore. It has become a Trumper circle jerk unfortunately.What's needed is regime change.

Trump was president but he didn’t control shit Bill Barr controlled the DOJ. Whether trump actually controlled Bill Barr is another question some yes because he worked for the president. I’m not convinced as he was a bush cronie.Yes but have you seen all of the pictures of trump with Epstein and maxwell ? And who appointed bill Barr ? Also  have you looked into bill Barr’s dad Donald’s Barr? He also had an encounter with Epstein at a school where he taught math and sciences even though he was an unqualified dropout and he wrote a creepy Sex slave book too .Why do so many people defend trump? If Hillary was president and this happened what would you be saying?\s\s------- Been banned from here for my posts no shock there ---------“Trump was appointed by God himself because he is the ONLY person capable of fighting the dEeP sTaTe evil pedo cabal behind the scenes!!” \s\s“Trump was president but he didn’t control shit.”Clinton has let her live this long?!Trump didn't have her killed like he did Epstein.If she has multiple programmed MKUKTRA alters she might be telling the truth.Under rated commentTrump was documented as having kicked Epstein out of his club for soliciting an underage girl the daughter if an employee.  And those pictures of them ""together"" are fewer than you think. But facts don't matter when you've been programmed to hate.Trump was documented raping a girl with Epstein in actual court documents in 2016.\s\s>	Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at two of the parties. The second sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by Defendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff and proceeded to rape her anally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop.\s\s>	Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he Defendant Epstein rather than Defendant Trump should have been the one who took Plaintiff’s virginity before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.\s\shttps://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Johnson_TrumpEpstein_Lawsuit.pdf\s\sEnjoySounds like you have been programmed to love trump.Early signs of pretended early dementia....how convienent!Do you know the nursery rhyme: ""Liar liar......"" etc?Near-total?

Until some of yall understand that both sides are doing elusive and crooked bull shit nothing will ever change.Definitely but it is fair to point out that Trump W George Sr Reagan and Nixon all have pretty immediate ties to election scandal. HW is a reach but Iran Contra had already happened and he was VP so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Care to share some examplesYes! Thank you!\sThis logic would seem to be so obvious but all i hear are the same same divide n conquer Rep/Democrat BS arguments everyone repeating whatever argument mainstream news spouts off today...\sIs there no hope?We should also remember facts like:\s\s* One of Jimmy Carter's nat'l security gurus literally [wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/October-Surprise-Americas-Hostages-Election/dp/0812919890/) on the topic. Obviously he believes the October Surprise was real.\s\s* Jimmy Carter himself once gave an interview to Playboy magazine and said he heard rumors of the Reagan/Bush (remember: Bush was the former director of the CIA) election team were working with the Iranians. Carter said he felt powerless to do anything and raising the issue would paint him as whining so he felt history would exonerate him.\s\s* The Iranian president at that time long after he retired from politics gave an interview and he said he was entertaining offers from *both* Carter and Reagan. The president bluntly said he accepted the deal that was best for Iran -- the deal offered by the Reagan/Bush election team to keep the hostages until Reagan was sworn in.\s\s* The hostages themselves reported that they were held on a plane and the Iranians would not let them leave until they got word that Reagan was sworn in.\s\sThe question is: Are we going to have an honest history and tell the truth that the Reagan/Bush election team committed acts of *treason?*Why would this be a surprise? They're ALL a bunch of sneaky lying assholes that think were stupid mostly bc we ARE!\sNothing to see here business as usual.Pretty sad to say but...\s\sPoliticians gonna politickPanama papers 2.0?Pretty much**VOTERS**: This is outrageous!

Too damn many people voting.Yup all those pesky idiot republicansShocking.Well not in light of what Jack Ruby (Jacob Rubinstein) did to said protect his community.\sIsraeli primary implication is still kept a secret as for their implication on 911. Just look at how was handle USS Liberty false flag attack from Israel…\sUSA is a puppet state.CIA did it obviously.\s\sJust post release the files and get it over with you crooked bastards.\s\sTrump delayed the release already. What could be so damning that both he and Biden won't let it out?\s\sCIA did it obviously.Did you watch American Horror Story this season? It follows the conspiracy (ive heard before) that JFK wasn’t down with the treaty we made with aliens and he was going to let the world know they exist. Him and Marilyn Monroe (his pillow buddy he told) got the silencing treatment. I think it was Marilyn Monroe wasn’t it? The conspiracy was the US government made a deal with the ETs that they could abduct and research so many humans a year as long as they hooked us up with some technology. Explains the huge jump in technology after the late 40’s with computers and such.Mossad with Jewish mafia (Jacob Rubinstein) did both Kennedy’s. Michael Piper did a pretty good job on the topic.\sThis is what they are trying so hard to hide.I think it’s very similar to what General Whitty (sp?) did with Trump by alerting the Chinese that there were level heads in the Oval Office to stop Donald from doing something stupid and dangerous..Kennedy was really close to bombing Cuba into oblivion but the CIA with LBJ’s knowledge reached the decision to stop JFK from moving forward in his plans.\sL“Could impact national security”\sBullshit.Technically they are telling the truth. It’s just not how you see it. What they really mean is that the CIA and plenty of other “agencies” are is serious fucking trouble when the masses finally find out that they’ve been used as lab rats for the last 100 years. \s“Could impact national security” is just another way of saying: “We are afraid of people WAKING UP”HWs dead. W is disgraced and Jeb is...Jeb. Just release it already I dont know that anybody actually completely believes the official narrative anymore and everybody involved is long deadThe CIA isn't dead. If it was the CIA who killed a sitting president and a sitting president finds that out and is being told by the current CIA not to release such information if they don't want to fear for their own life coverup successful.Dr. Mary's Monkey: How the Unsolved Murder of a Doctor a Secret Laboratory in New Orleans and Cancer-Causing Monkey Viruses Are Linked to Lee Harvey Oswald the JFK Assassination and Emerging Global EpidemicsOkay what the hell does this mean?

Why would RT want to stir the pot in America...\s\sLook whether all of the redacted and classified files are ever released is irrelevant.  It's been a dog and pony show for decades.  Does anyone with any common sense think that the truth is actually written down in a file somewhere?   Even if it was originally which is ridiculous it's long gone now.\s\sNot sure how anyone could believe any new ""revelations"" that appear if anything new comes out.  But that's also not of concern because nothing new is coming out.  Few more decades after even the grandkids of people that were around then are aged and could give a care less.. that's when you'll see some stuff pop up.  It won't be the truth about what happened .  But there will be disclosure about some dirty CIA deals some other stuff on the edges of this that the gvt would be embarrassed about.  But not the truth of everyone involved in the death of JFK.\s\sMy children's generation is so far removed from this that they vaguely know who JFK is from a fleeting thirty minutes in a US history class.\s\sAfter quite some time put into this particular conspiracy I'm resigned to accepting we won't ever know the complete truth.I agree. Plus like think about it. Imagine you are president and you find out the CIA killed a sitting president. Are you *really* going to tell the world that if the CIA is advising you not to? I would personally feel my life was threatened if I both had the information and released that information. I still personally would probably release it if I was as old as biden or as young as I am now with no family but I understand others not doing so.""Sec. 3.  Temporary Certification.  In light of the agencies’ proposals for continued postponement under the statutory standard the Archivist’s request for an extension of time to engage with the agencies and the need for an appropriate review and disclosure process I agree with the Archivist’s recommendation. Temporary continued postponement is necessary to protect against identifiable harm to the military defense intelligence operations law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.  Accordingly by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America including section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act I hereby certify that all information within records that agencies have proposed for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) shall be withheld from full public disclosure until December 15 2022.""\s\s[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-executive-departments-and-agencies-on-the-temporary-certification-regarding-disclosure-of-information-in-certain-records-related-to-the-assassination-of-president-john-f-k/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/memorandum-for-the-heads-of-executive-departments-and-agencies-on-the-temporary-certification-regarding-disclosure-of-information-in-certain-records-related-to-the-assassination-of-president-john-f-k/)\s\sSimple google searchyes basedHonestly wouldn't surprise me if the hordes of Netflix detectives that 'solved' Making A Murderer and Tiger King etc. crack one of the most mysterious cases in recent history.Could also call in the GME Apes they’d have DD reports streaming in and it would be solved in not time. 🦍🔦Ⓜ️ystery So✅ved❗️Wait.

It's funny how no one ever points the finger at Cuba or Russia because they had every reason to do so. Although I think they'd hide it if it was Cuba just to avoid the embarrassment of such a small poor country being successful. I do think it was the US government that did it though or at least some cabal within the US governments ranks.  But for all we know we could be blindsided by whatever the truth is if we were to learn it it could even be a country we wouldn't even think like China.  People would just ask ""Why?"".  But that would also kind of help to obscure who did it because if you're not even on the radar no one will ever be able to make the connection.It was the Secret Service and it was an accident. I'm 100% convinced of this.\s\sThey don't want the files released because it's a fucking embarrassment so they've let the theories run wild for decades.

We want to give you non-biased facts and news. If we don’t please tell us.” What the fuck is wrong with that?I was going to post about this but I'm too lazy. I'm very curious about this as well. I don't suppose it is the content of what they are saying that upsets people so much as that they are being made to say it. It's very cyberpunk/late stage capitalism and even if this in particular isn't so bad I think those dystopian ideas scare people enough to call out anything associated. I'm included along those people.We all think that the news anchors have their own opinions etc. They are just reading a script and following the narrative of what was presented to them so they can keep their job because guess what? It’s a job!!! It’s not like they are independent journalists. It’s all just “entertainment” and we take it as factual information when in fact it is all biased and just a small piece of the truth.

Hard to say if the tech would be more prevalent if in the hands of humans. Or any country in particular. I’d imagine it wouldn’t be held back in order to assert dominance over others.There's a saying ""Be careful what you ask for."" We are asking for ""unidentified"" and so that is what we'll get. Therefore I am more interested in Identified Flying Objects that are not from this planet or world. If we keep asking about UFOs or UAPs the government will give us second hand accounts largely copies of what the CIA has obtained from other governments which are therefore unidentified by the US government.

That's my problem with ""Latinx"" if that wasn't clear. It's a term imposed by the most upper-crusty of the elite upon the community that it labels. The word does EXACTLY the thing that it purports to avoid.[deleted]This is why helping to get out the vote is so important.His argument about “protecting our own voters” makes zero sense. GOP voters are the preferred voters in basically every way under the current system.I read protect their voters from their own broader suppression.Party of victim mentality.We already saw this with the primary. It's so fucked up!!Remember. Electoralism is a Hobby and nothing more. Your praxis should not involve asking the oppressors to be good on their terms.Republicans are so gross.Quickly followed up by an angry tweet demanding all White House staffers and loyalists have all verbal conversations in a faraday cage.We are so so fucked.The fix is in.https://youtu.be/8GBAsFwPglwNormal countryEven if my vote will make a microscopic impact I still believe I should vote. If its rigged ok then just more ammumition to bring em down with once we have turned the tables. Plus I find it ironic that everyone was in panic over russian interference but no one is worried about interference from within our own country. The world is more messed up than the people in picasso's paintings.Republicans like to convince themselves that Democrats are constantly cheating so that they feel justified in cheating themselves. The problem is that they have found any modern presidential campaigns that featured Demcratic cheating but nearly all have featured Republican cheating.\s\sGrag Palast's book ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"" details the steps that Florida Governor Jeb Bush took to throw the election in favor of his idiot brother in 2000. It started before the election by generously purging the voter rolls in primarily Democratic counties and continued after the election when the Republicans used a little known law about challenging votes to challenge thousands of Democratic votes in Democratic counties while challenging very few Republican votes. Those challenges were not investigated or answered just thrown out for no reason other than the Republican party challenged them for unknown reasons. People who had voted and thought their votes counted had their votes tossed out for no reason completely unbeknownst to them. There were other schemes like disappearing ballots etc.\s\sThat has become the basic playbook for voter suppression and it continues in every Republican election. To this day nearly every important election in Florida is won by Republicans and by a razor thin margin. \s\sThat playbook is now being used in other Republican states and they have added plenty of other tricks as well (closing of polls in Democratic leaning areas non-counting of absentee and mail-in ballots non-mailing of mail in ballots etc.).\s\sOn one of his recent interviews on Fox News Trump railed against the concept of election becoming mail in only saying that Republicans would never win another election. If your party can't win when EVERYONE votes then perhaps your party needs to alter their agenda.Rush Limbaugh was encouraging voters in California and Chicago to ignore stay at home orders because they'd already crossed over into ""herd immunity.""  The locales aren't random... he has an intense hatred for the ""Democrat Party"" in California and Chicago.  And he wants to see how many people he can kill apparently.\s\sHe's on PUBLIC airwaves too!  Can anyone tell me why we allow propagandists who are actively trying to kill Americans on our PUBLIC airwaves?  Is the a First Amendment thing?  He has the god-given right to try to kill use because... well just because?So what? Everybody knows (or should know) there is voter supprssion. Both in the general and in democratic primaries. And most people don't give a fuck.I don’t think people know actually. I think people are unaware outside of the lies and racist delusions Trump spinsAnd you’re going to do nothing about it.

Devin Nunes knew about it. There are photos on Twitter of the Orange County field director using a fake box. The whole California GOP knew about it.Woohoo voter suppression. God these people are so fucking desperate it's disgusting.Every time the GOP complains about something and pretends the democrats do it they are really the ones doing it themselves. Nothing ever sits in their stomach lolI really don't understand why Democrats were so insistent on everyone voting by mail. Sure we should encourage any high risk people to do so but with masks distancing and washing hands afterwards going to the polls is no different from going to the grocery store.    \s\sIt seems like by encouraging everyone to vote by mail we have opened up more opportunities for voter suppression.   \s\sI'm happy to be proven wrong if someone has evidence showing that mail in will not cost us votes but to me it seems like our naivete will come back to bite us.I'd bet the farm that the Trump Crime Syndicate is profiting off of this and many other covid related ""contracts"".\s\s>The Post reported that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was paying Panthera about $5.50 per mask decidedly more than what the government pays companies with an established background in producing medical supplies such as 3M which charges about $0.63 per mask.\s\s>Panthera's parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last fall and one of its owners last year said it'd had no employees since May 2018 The Post reported citing sworn testimony. It's no longer listed as an LLC in Virginia where its main office is after fees went unpaid the newspaper said.\s\s>Chuck Hagel a former defense secretary told The Post something was ""amiss"" about this order. ""This is not how the government procures training or any type of supplies"" he said. ""You just wouldn't do business with somebody like that.""Historically this stuff actually happens frequently when the government goes into crisis spending.  Literally anybody could apply for a government contract and when the directive is “Get more masks now!” it’s probable that more than a few people are going to try to obtain a piece of the pie even though they don’t actually have the capabilities to deliver.  And I’m guessing that some of the typical fail-safe government procurement procedures have been suspended in order to respond to the crisis.\s\s\sWhen Joe Biden led the Recovery Act they actually had historically low amounts of fraud but that’s more the exception than the rule.  Just based on probability I’m sure this scandal is more related to the government bureaucracy messing up rather than Trump or his family directly profiting off this.\s\s\sThe owners of this company better deliver the contract or hope they can return every penny they took from Uncle Sam.  Cause the Feds collections department doesn’f f*** around.All these crooks need to be jailed when we overthrow this corrupt empire in November. No one should left untouched. We need Senate and Presidency to achieve this goal.Christ.  Open theft in the middle of a crisis.  This is our president.I’m not even surprised when this stuff happens under this administration anymore.\s\sHe wasn’t wrong when he said he could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue and not lose a vote. His cult is so locked in.For Trump it's always about the grift.It's corruption folks.[deleted]They have a Twitter account.  @USGAO.  Although if I understand correctly they get their marching orders from Congress.  Time to write your congressmen!This goes past elections and politics it’s criminal someone needs to go to jail over this. Initially I thought the headline was sensational but after reading the article I’m sick to my stomach.Just like they gave Whitefish Energy a company with two employees the contract to rebuild Puerto Rico's electricity infrastructure even though they had never done anything like that before.  And the company just happened to be named after the hometown of one of Trump's cabinet secretariesOf course it's a PMC. Why am I not surprised.Well Trump does have a soft spot for corporate bankruptcy to be fair.But Solyndra! /sOpportunistic middle-men who have connections but not necessarily product.  These guys are likely outbidding suppliers who are already selling to the govt hoping to secure that product then to re-sell it themselves to the govt at their inflated price of $5.50.Chaos is a ladder.\s\s100% guarantee these guys are members of Mar-a-Lago \s\sThe GOP is all about selling off America to the lowest bidder who will kick back pennies on the dollar.> Chaos is a ladder.\s\sThankfully Trump is no Petyr Baelish.  More like a Robert Baratheon or even Mad King Aerys.I don’t think I’ve ever failed to be impressed by the utter stupidity that comes out of this administrationI'd be willing to bet that the money tracks back to the Trump or Kushner families somehow. Perhaps a shell to take funds from taxpayers to transfer as a payment to a Russian oligarch or Deutsch Bank.""We don't need oversight *I'm* the oversight.""But I thought the swamp was drained??? \s\sGuys wasn’t the swamp drained?!?I think the word you are looking for is embezzledPretty sure this is a sensationalized article. The parent company going bankrupt has no bearing on the child company being able to manufacture them. The parent company is just a parasitic middle man in this and I’m not sure why he’s paying $5 per mask.The child company doesn’t do manufacturing and the article makes that clear.

Elected officials should not be eligible for pardoning.Trump pardoned stone right? Would that pardon cover this? Or was that a narrow pardon?A confession letter written by Joel Greenberg in the final months of the Trump presidency claims that he and close associate Rep. Matt Gaetz paid for sex with multiple women—as well as a girl who was 17 at the time.\s\s**“On more than one occasion this individual was involved in sexual activities with several of the other girls the congressman from Florida’s 1st Congressional District and myself” Greenberg wrote in reference to the 17-year-old.**\s\s**“From time to time gas money or gifts rent or partial tuition payments were made to several of these girls including the individual who was not yet 18. I did see the acts occur firsthand and Venmo transactions Cash App or other payments were made to these girls on behalf of the Congressman.”**\s\sThe letter which The Daily Beast recently obtained was written after Greenberg—who was under federal indictment—**asked Roger Stone to help him secure a pardon from then-President Donald Trump.**\s\s**A series of private messages starting in late 2020—also recently obtained by The Daily Beast—shows a number of exchanges between Greenberg and Stone conducted over the encrypted messaging app Signal with communications set to disappear. However Greenberg appears to have taken screenshots of a number of their conversations.**\s\s**“If I get you $250k in Bitcoin would that help or is this not a financial matter” Greenberg wrote to Stone one message shows.**\s\s“I understand all of this and have taken it into consideration” Stone replied. “I will know more in the next 24 hours I cannot push too hard because of the nonsense surrounding pardons.”\s\s**“I hope you are prepared to wire me $250000 because I am feeling confident” Stone wrote to Greenberg on Jan. 13.**\s\sIn a text message to The Daily Beast Stone said that Greenberg had tried to hire him to assist with a pardon but he denied asking for or receiving payment or interceding on his behalf. He did however confirm he had Greenberg prepare “a document explaining his prosecution.”\s\sThey know he paid me to pay the girls and that he and I both had sex with the girl who was underage.\s— Message from Joel Greenberg to Roger Stone\s\sIn the private text messages to Stone Greenberg described his activities with Gaetz repeatedly referring to the Republican congressman by his initials “MG” or as “Matt.”\s\s**“My lawyers that I fired know the whole story about MG’s involvement” Greenberg wrote to Stone on Dec. 21. “They know he paid me to pay the girls and that he and I both had sex with the girl who was underage.”**\s\sAs part of the effort to obtain a pardon Greenberg wrote multiple drafts of his confession letter. The Daily Beast obtained two typed versions and an earlier handwritten one. Certified forensic document examiner and handwriting expert Wendy Carlson compared the letter to writing samples obtained through two public records requests. She said it was her professional expert opinion that the person who authored a 2019 financial disclosure for Joel Greenberg as well as Greenberg’s 2020 Board of Elections form was the same as the author of the letter.\s\s“The person who authored the forms has been identified as the person who authored the letter” Carlson said.\s\sIn those letters Greenberg detailed his relationship with Gaetz. He confessed to paying young women for sex. And he claimed that he Gaetz and others had sex with a minor they believed to be 19 at the time. Greenberg said he learned she was underage on Sept. 4 2017 from “an anonymous tip” and quickly contacted Gaetz.\s\s“Immediately I called the congressman and warned him to stay clear of this person and informed him she was underage” Greenberg wrote. “He was equally shocked and disturbed by this revelation.”\s\sGreenberg continued in the handwritten draft that he “confronted” the then-17-year-old and explained to her “how serious of a situation this was how many people she put in danger.”\s\s“She apologized and recognized that by lying about her age she endangered many people” he continued. “There was no further contact with this individual until after her 18th birthday.”\s\sBut after she reached the age of legal consent in Florida Greenberg re-established contact. As The Daily Beast previously reported about five months after her 18th birthday Gaetz sent Greenberg $900 in two Venmo transactions—one titled “Test” and the other titled “hit up ___.” The blank contained a nickname for this girl and Greenberg paid her and two other women a total of $900 about six hours later.\s\sIn his confession letter Greenberg also admitted he facilitated Gaetz’s interactions with college students—and paid them on his behalf.\s\s“All of the girls were in college or post college and it was not uncommon for either myself or the Congressman to help anyone [sic] of these girls financially whether it was a car payment a flight home to see their family or something as simple as helping pay a speeding ticket” Greenberg wrote.\s\sA partial record of Greenberg’s Venmo and Cash App transactions suggests that payments were usually for a lot more than “gas money.” The Daily Beast identified more than 150 Venmo payments from Greenberg to women as well as more than 70 additional payments on the Cash App that were generally between $300 and $500—though some exceeded $1000. The Daily Beast also talked to 12 of the more than 40 different women who received money and they all said they understood Greenberg was paying them at least in part for sex.\s\sGreenberg a disgraced local politician in Florida currently faces a sweeping 33-count indictment that ranges from stalking to sex trafficking. In March The New York Times revealed that the initial investigation into the Seminole County tax official expanded as agents looked into his role in arranging paid sexual encounters for his friend Matt Gaetz.\s\sFederal prosecutors have not criminally charged Gaetz—or even publicly confirmed the expansion of their probe. While Gaetz acknowledges the existence of the investigation he denies having sex with an underage teen. But at some point Greenberg began to cooperate with investigators a development his lawyer has suggested poses a serious problem for Gaetz.\s\sThat defense lawyer Fritz Scheller declined to comment for this story citing attorney-client privilege.\s\sGaetz’s office did not respond. However Logan Circle Group an outside public relations firm Gaetz has hired sent the following statement:“Congressman Gaetz has never paid for sex nor has he had sex with a 17 year old as an adult. We are now one month after your outlet and others first reported such lies and no one has gone on record to directly accuse him of either. Politico however has reported Mr. Greenberg threatening to make false accusations against others which seems noteworthy for your story and in fact sounds like the entirety of your story. Congressman Gaetz has had no role in advocating for or against a pardon for Greenberg and doubts such a pardon was ever even considered.”\s\sThe Politico article referred to in the statement does not say Greenberg was threatening to make false accusations against others but does say that an associate claimed Greenberg had warned friends that “everyone is going to need a lawyer.”\s\sNeither the U.S. Secret Service nor federal prosecutors with the Middle District of Florida would provide comment for this article either citing a policy of not confirming or denying the existence of an ongoing investigation.\s\sIn the final months of the Trump presidency Greenberg and Stone exchanged several texts about a pardon over the encrypted messaging app Signal. While images show that the pair frequently set messages to automatically delete Greenberg regularly took screenshots of their communications.\s\sStone who received a presidential commutation in July but at the time had not yet been pardoned communicated with Greenberg for months about the latter’s desire for a pardon.\s\sThe messages show that in November the pair discussed putting together a “document” which later took the form of a confession letter and background missive about all the ways in which Greenberg had been loyal to Trump. In their early conversations Greenberg told Stone that the letter was “about 8-10 pages” and asked if it should be shortened.\s\s“No” Stone replied “use as much space as you need to tell the story fully but be certain to include your leader ship [sic] for Trump prominently.”\s\sGreenberg almost immediately responded that he had “killed” himself for Trump. “And I’ve killed my self [sic] for Matt” he said.\s\sThe letter went through multiple drafts and detailed Greenberg’s encounters with Gaetz but it also focused on Greenberg’s early support of Trump’s run in 2016 such as posting a “Super Trump” highway billboard on Interstate-4. (A version of the letter actually includes the image Greenberg used for the billboard.)\s\sOn Nov. 20 2020 Stone told Greenberg he had received “the document” and would show it to the team that “got me my commutation.”\s\s“I will review it with them and give you a budget. This is very doable and the time is now” Stone wrote.\s\sAn update from Stone came just after midnight on Dec. 8: “Your thing is being looked at and I will have an answer by Saturday as to whether you have a viable shot for justice and how to go about it.”\s\s“Thank you so much Roger” Greenberg replied. “I am very thankful for you. I pray that the Lord will help. I remain optimistic and will wait to hear back from you.”\s\sStone quickly sought to dampen expectations surrounding “the whole pardon circus.”\s\s“This is treacherous territory with a lot of different players such as Jared and Giuliani playing a hand” Stone wrote presumably referring to Trump adviser Jared Kushner and the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. “I have two things I’m trying to get done. Sit tight.”\s\sOn Dec. 21 Greenberg told Stone that government investigators were pressing him to cooperate. “The FBI DOJ Secret Service and a bunch of people from DC have repeatedly made attempts to meet with my [sic] lately. I have declined. But they are definitely ramping up pressure.”\s\s“They want me to flip” he continued. “They have made offers which I’ve declined. I even fired my lawyers this week because they tried to convince me to cooperate and that a pardon was impossible.”\s\sGreenberg then revealed to Stone that his former lawyers were aware of the “whole story” regarding Matt Gaetz’s role.\s\s“My lawyers that I fired know the whole story about MG’s involvement. They know he paid me to pay the girls and that he and I both had sex with the girl who was underage. So naturally they think that is my golden ticket” Greenberg wrote.\s\s“And while I have not had any communication with MG he absolutely has to know that the sex charge they hit me with would be what they would hit him with” Greenberg continued.\s\sA distressed Greenberg told Stone that he felt “abandoned"" by his allies but emphasized that Gaetz—who was ”like a son” to the President of the United States—could save him: “One conversation with POTUS and he can get this done and it all goes away.”\s\sGreenberg said that while he had discussed pardons with Gaetz’s lawyer he had not heard a reply and would “have to do what's best for me and my family” after Trump left office.\s\s“You think MG is going to come visit me in prison?” he said then proposed the $250000 Bitcoin deposit.\s\sStone replied that he had considered those points but “cannot push too hard because of the nonsense surrounding pardons.”\s\sAs Trump neared his final days in office he signaled an intent to issue a wave of pardons and reports at the time suggested legal reprieve could be had for the right price. Stone communicated with Greenberg about his efforts to navigate the heavy traffic of pardon-seekers.\s\sToday is the day. We will know by the end of the day. I think you sent me some document but it disappeared. I hope you are prepared to wire me $250000 because I am feeling confident.\s— Message from Roger Stone to Joel Greenberg\sOn Dec. 23 Trump pardoned Stone for the crimes from his 2019 conviction. The next day on Christmas Eve Stone acknowledged to Greenberg that he was having difficulty with the Gaetz dimension.\s\s“It is hard for me to understand why MG would do nothing[.] Yes he is potentially damaged if the matter goes forward” Stone wrote. The three men—Greenberg Stone and Gaetz—all shared a friendship dating back several years and Stone apparently couldn’t figure out why Gaetz wouldn’t help Greenberg get a pardon.\s\sBut on the morning of Jan. 13 Greenberg received this text from Stone: “Today is the day. We will know by the end of the day. I think you sent me some document but it disappeared. I hope you are prepared to wire me $250000 because I am feeling confident.”\s\sThere was only a week left in the Trump presidency. It’s unclear if money was ever exchanged but Greenberg offered to pay extra if Stone could in fact get him a pardon.“If you can get this done today I’ll add another 50k” Greenberg texted Stone.\s\sIn a subsequent message Stone wrote that White House lawyer Pat Cipollone had taken Greenberg’s name out of the list of hundreds of people who might be pardoned. Cipollone didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment Thursday but according to three people familiar with the matter Greenberg’s name repeatedly made it to the Trump White House for a presidential pardon. The Daily Beast was shown an image of one such list and Greenberg’s name and a favorable mini-profile were indeed included.\s\sAdministration officials swiftly shot down Greenberg’s application however and several senior White House officials at the time said they were not even aware that Stone was involved in a behind-the-scenes maneuvering.\s\sBut as Stone explained it in a Jan. 30 text—a full 10 days after Trump left office—Gaetz was partly to blame.\s\s“What I don’t understand is why MJ would not help me at all and actually told me not to help you which I tried to do anyway. In the end it would not have mattered. Cipollone killed everything we wanted to get done and that includes stuff MG wanted” Stone wrote immediately clarifying that “MJ” was a typo and that he meant “MG.”\s\s“Ok. He actually said not to help me? Wow” Greenberg replied.\s\s“If you repeat it you’re really going to hurt me” Stone warned.\s\s“I won’t Roger. I don’t and haven’t talked to him. I won’t” Greenberg said.\s\sI made no formal or informal effort in regard to a pardon for Mr. Greenberg... I never requested or received a penny from Mr. Greenberg\s— Roger Stone to The Daily Beast\sStone acknowledged Thursday night that there may be “copies of correspondence between me and Mr. Greenberg” but he questioned whether they were complete unedited or accurate.\s\s“I made no formal or informal effort in regard to a pardon for Mr. Greenberg” Stone said. “I recall requesting a document explaining his prosecution The [sic] details of which I was unfamiliar with.”\s\s“I never requested or received a penny from Mr. Greenberg” he added. “I recall him offering to retain me and I declined. To be clear I did advocate pardons for a number of people who I had [sic] been unfairly treated by the justice system and was compensated by no one for doing so.”\s\s“Urge you to be very careful” Stone said at the end of his text. “I will take any appropriate legal action in the event that you publish anything that is false or defamatory. Sounds to me like you have been presented some kind of cut and paste record.”\s\s—With additional reporting by Asawin Suebsaeng and Matt FullerFauci the lying sack should resign his post and apologize to Rand Paul. What a tool Fauci is!!!Did you read the article?  Fauci didn’t have that information and neither did the NIH.  He didn’t lie. And this isn’t likely relevant to the pandemic even though that won’t stop you from suggesting it is.  \s\sThe problem here was the NIH didn’t helicopter the entity that it partnered with.

We now have to codify into law requirements to hold presidential office such as releasing tax returns divestment ability to hold a security clearance no publicly asking a foreign power to retrieve your opponent’s computer data no confiscating translators notes...etc so forth.\s\sEdit:\s\sHe’s the prototypical con-man that laughs about his marks being stupid enough to believe him.  \s\s>tell outrageous lies play the government and creditors for fools steal everything not nailed down today figure out how to solve tomorrow’s consequences tomorrow and already be onto the next con before anyone can catch him on the last one.I'm not familiar with this org but they're putting into words what I think is the real issue with the Trump financial situation. Let me know if there's anything wrong with their take. (some emphasis is mine)\s\s>But despite its potential to land the entire Trump family in penury and jail what is far more terrifying for the country isn’t what lies in his past of tax avoidance. It’s the time bomb of debt that lies in Trump’s very near future. **It’s about the mystery of who owns Trump’s outlandish debts and the degree of secret power they may be wielding over the country.**  \s>  \s>The particulars of the Trump grift are sickening in both the details and grand scope. It’s not just an issue of his class: the scale of his tax avoidance far dwarfs that of most others in his income bracket. Despite posturing as a billionaire Trump paid only $750 in taxes for the years 2016 and 2017. **He tried to use the same trick to offload tens of millions in tax burdens by claiming business losses twice in as many decades except that the second time he actually still retained partial ownership of the underlying business and has been in a $72 million battle with the IRS for a decade ever since–a battle he should lose by all rights. His daughter Ivanka was hired as a consultant for the same work she was doing in her main job–an obvious and incredibly stupid** [ **tax-avoidance grift that could easily land her jail**](https://www.politicususa.com/2020/09/27/ivanka-trump-tax-fraud.html)**. He (likely illegally) deducted $70000 in hair care for his TV show. And so on.**  \s>  \s>Keep in mind though that this is just what we know of *from his own personal reporting to the IRS*. **It’s not a forensic accounting document.** These financial statements are Trump’s best foot forward to the government with no knowing what criminal rot lies in the details.\s\s&#x200B;\s\s>One fact stands out far above all the others in its staggering implications: **Donald Trump is personally responsible for $421 million worth of loans coming due in the next few years.** Not his business. Him. Personally. He has no means of repaying them. He already refinanced his few profitable properties and sold off most of his stocks to stay afloat. He appears short on liquidity. **And we still don’t know to whom he owes the money.**\s\sThe article goes on to talk about his finances in the early 2000s and how nobody in the US would lend to him. He only found funding with one bank [Deutsche Bank](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/magazine/deutsche-bank-trump.html).He has $2.1B in assets. You are right that they aren't liquid but at the right price he could easily dump one (or a few) of these at a bargain basement deal and someone would snatch them up. \s\sTrue he isn't as rich as some people think and he projected himself and the COVID shutdown hasn't helped anything at all and he is currently in a pickle concerning close to term debts. That being said to claim that he won't find creditors or be able to satisfy those loans is nonsense.""We have all the money we need out of Russia"" - Eric TrumpThe amount of stuff you have to ignore to still not see what's plainly obvious it boggles the mind.This is both crazy and pathetic.  Wowhttps://twitter.com/HouseForeign/status/1321990346335752192\s\s**House Foreign Affairs Committee:**\s\sWe were able to pinpoint where and when the Hunter Biden-Burisma conspiracy theory started. It was in December 2015 in a Russia-controlled Crimean city.\s\sEverything since then—Trump’s shakedown of Ukraine that led to impeachment the sham Senate investigation the laptop this fake dossier—all had its origins nearly five years ago at the hands of Russian trolls aiming to smear the former Vice President.\s\sSo whoever is pushing this nonsense in the remaining days before the election just remember: it’s Russian propaganda and anyone who repeats it is helping Putin undermine American democracy.Is this tucker - have no expectations of me being honest - carlson's 'proof' that ups lost n found?\s\sDiscrediting it before publication instead of after strikes  blow for truth honestly & the American way!This article doesn’t actually address any of the evidence with the laptop hard drives or Bobulinsky testimony.  They are trying to dismiss it by saying that because there was a previous attempt to disseminate false info that this also must be false info.  However the reason the previous attempt was dismissed was because the evidence and the source of the dossier were assessed and found to not be true.  That process hasn’t played out and hasn’t been shown to yield the conclusion that the current accusations are false.  The evidence that has come forward needs to be examined on its own merit and weighed separately instead of being thrown out just because a separate and unrelated attack on Hunter Biden was shown to be false.Every time these lunatics cry wolf we’re supposed to chase them down their stupid rabbit hole. There’s a reason none of this is gaining any traction. It’s because they’re the only ones stupid enough to fall for it again and again and again.Omg oof'Just because the ""person"" and ""intel firm"" behind the document were made up and just because the laptop story was also made up doesn't mean it's still not on the up and up' is a bold choice I'll give you that."

It won't matter one iota to Trump's supporters.It won’t matter one iota to those who unwittingly support Putin.   FTFY.We have known this the whole time. The 1st reporting i remember about the Kremlin link was in the summer of 2016. A ton of traffic was detected from an ISP address in Trump tower. The address only received traffic from one place in Russia and it was a lot of traffic. The article concluded it was a 2 way communication between Trump campaign and some authority in Russia. \s\sEverything that has happened since backs up this initial theory. The president of the US was a Russian asset weather he understood that it not.I'm not sure about some of the stuff people are saying about the Russia link but yeah they definitely wanted him in there wether he was in direct communication with them or not and even if he didn't realize that I don't think he would care either way.I wish any of this mattered to them. It don't.This is the smoking gun at long last held in the hand of Vladimir Putin.\s\sI would still like to see some work done on authenticating this or otherwise corroborating it.\s\sThis confirms what I already thought to be true to an astonishing level really so I'm a little suspicious of it.So if it's true now then why is Trump not in handcuffs and in prison for fraud and treason?So basically all Trump supporters helped Putin hurt America.

Now after the election Proud boy leader  Tarrio threatened to mobilize the group. “We’re rolling out” Tarrio posted on Sunday. “Standby order has been rescinded.” President Donald Trump insists he deserves no blame for divisions in America. LITTLE do the other genius GOP members know “THE GOP will pay a more lasting price.” What is left of them as they destroy themselves?  History will say “Trump was the moral test and the Republican Party failed”  . “It Was All a Lie” the signs were there. Ignoring evil fanned the flames. TRUMP base of proud Boys QAnon and white supremacy groups are coming undone. As FOAK leader Chapman embodied some of the Proud Boys’ bloodiest and most bigoted tendencies leading brawls urging fans to “smash \[anti-fascists\] on sight” railing against Muslims and encouraging the lynching of politicians.

0,ConspiracyII,EnoughTrumpSpam,62,"again from his own mouth...""About a week after that interview Mr. Epstein called and asked if I’d like to have dinner that Saturday with him and Woody Allen. I said I’d be out of town. "" \s\sBruh. You're meant to be an investigative journalist. Cancel your plans and jump on a fucking plane. WTF?Also this:\s\s> Then early this year Mr. Epstein called to ask if I’d be interested in writing his biography. He sounded almost plaintive. I sensed that what he really wanted was companionship. As his biographer I’d have no choice but to spend hours listening to his saga. Already leery of any further ties to him I was relieved I could say that I was already busy with another book.\s\sThat book would have been a guaranteed best-seller. What author/journalist in his right mind would walk way from that?> Several months passed. Then early this year Mr. Epstein called to ask if  I’d be interested in writing his biography. He sounded almost  plaintive. I sensed that what he really wanted was companionship.  \s\sThis whole thing reads like Epstein was a Trump level bullshitter desperate to the point of being clingy to have someone to bullshit to after years of being a persona non grata. I don't think you can trust any word he has ever said. Sure he has probably seen a lot of celebrities do a lot of shitty things but this whole interview appears to be a self promoting rant by a bitter lonely sociopath.Just think if he had had a little more prescience he could have been President rather than a prison suicide statistic.Are you working for one of these Silicon Valley types mentioned in the article? I'm just kidding. But what is written in the article seems plausible to me.The author asks “what would Epstein have told me?”  Lies and incompleteness. Trump is dumb by these standards but Epstein was notoriously smart.Given all the wealthy people Epstein possibly has seriously criminally inculpatory material on why are all the MSM going ape with their firm claims that suspicions that he was killed to keep him quiet are nothing but paranoid conspiracy theories?\s\sAfter it turns out that it is really true that he was a super-rich criminal mastermind pedophile sex fiend with a private island and connections with many of the rich and powerful why should we assume that there's no more bizarre stuff to be disclosed?\s\sEspecially since it's already shown that POtuS was one of his partying buddies and he died under questionable circumstances while in the custody of of agents of one of the people he very likely had dirt on.\s\sAnd the MSM just keep saying ""Move Along! Nothing to see here"".\s\sDoes anyone think that an ""investigation"" led by lapdog Barr will do anything other than make sure POtuS is untouched?Actually a pretty good article it's surprising how open Epstein was abt this shitHe was probably lonely as he was a pariah at that point wanted to feel important by talking to a journalist. I liked the article too wish it was longer. The Elon Musk connection was surprising. Hoping they find Ghislane Maxwell and grill her. But it's more likely she'll either never be found or will commit suicideActually you think he was open only because you have no way of comparing his versions of the truth with anything else. He has the hallmarks of a classic psychopath.He probably does but the dude was a psychopath whose word should be taken with less than a grain of salt*More* than a grain of salt surely?It’s paywalled any chance of a copy Paste?Almost exactly a year ago on Aug. 16 2018 I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion.\s\sThe overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich famous and powerful people and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.\s\sSo one of my first thoughts on hearing of Mr. Epstein’s suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Mr. Epstein knew he has taken it with him.\s\sDuring our conversation Mr. Epstein made no secret of his own scandalous past — he’d pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from underage girls and was a registered sex offender — and acknowledged to me that he was a pariah in polite society. At the same time he seemed unapologetic. His very notoriety he said was what made so many people willing to confide in him. Everyone he suggested has secrets and he added compared with his own they seemed innocuous. People confided in him without feeling awkward or embarrassed he claimed.\s\sSubscribe to With Interest\sCatch up and prep for the week ahead with this newsletter of the most important business insights delivered Sundays.\s\sSIGN UP\sADVERTISEMENT\s\s\sI’d never met Mr. Epstein before. I had contacted him because my colleagues and I had heard a rumor that he was advising Tesla’s embattled chief executive Elon Musk who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private.\s\sThe Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Mr. Musk’s remarks which moved markets but didn’t appear to have much basis in fact. There were calls for Mr. Musk to relinquish his position as Tesla’s chairman and for Tesla to recruit more independent directors. I’d heard that Mr. Epstein was compiling a list of candidates at Mr. Musk’s behest — and that Mr. Epstein had an email from Mr. Musk authorizing the search for a new chairman.\s\sUnlock more free articles.\sCreate an account or log in\sMr. Musk and Tesla vehemently deny this. “It is incorrect to say that Epstein ever advised Elon on anything” a spokeswoman for Mr. Musk Keely Sulprizio said Monday.\s\sWhen I contacted Mr. Epstein he readily agreed to an interview. The caveat was that the conversation would be “on background” which meant I could use the information as long as I didn’t attribute it directly to him. (I consider that condition to have lapsed with his death.)\s\sHe insisted that I meet him at his house which I’d seen referred to as the largest single-family home in Manhattan. This seems plausible: I initially walked past the building on East 71st Street because it looked more like an embassy or museum than a private home. Next to the imposing double doors was a polished brass plaque with the initials “J.E.” and a bell. After I rang the door was opened by a young woman her blond hair pulled back in a chignon who greeted me with what sounded like an Eastern European accent.\s\sEditors’ Picks\s\s‘After a Few Moments of Awkward Silence We Reached the Other Side’\s\sSeduced Then Scorned by My Work Wife\s\sAre You Rich? Where Does Your Net Worth Rank in America?\s\sADVERTISEMENT\s\s\sI can’t say how old she was but my guess would be late teens or perhaps 20. Given Mr. Epstein’s past this struck me as far too close to the line. Why would Mr. Epstein want a reporter’s first impression to be that of a young woman opening his door?\s\sThe woman led me up a monumental staircase to a room on the second floor overlooking the Frick museum across the street. It was quiet the lighting dim and the air-conditioning was set very low. After a few minutes Mr. Epstein bounded in dressed casually in jeans and a polo shirt shook my hand and said he was a big fan of my work. He had a big smile and warm manner. He was trim and energetic perhaps from all the yoga he said he was practicing. He was undeniably charismatic.\s\sBefore we left the room he took me to a wall covered with framed photographs. He pointed to a full-length shot of a man in traditional Arab dress. “That’s M.B.S.” he said referring to Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. The crown prince had visited him many times and they spoke often Mr. Epstein said.\s\sHe led me to a large room at the rear of the house. There was an expansive table with about 20 chairs. Mr. Epstein took a seat at the head and I sat to his left. He had a computer a small blackboard and a phone to his right. He said he was doing some foreign-currency trading.\s\sBehind him was a table covered with more photographs. I noticed one of Mr. Epstein with former President Bill Clinton and another of him with the director Woody Allen. Displaying photos of celebrities who had been caught up in sex scandals of their own also struck me as odd.\s\sMr. Epstein avoided specifics about his work for Tesla. He told me that he had good reason to be cryptic: Once it became public that he was advising the company he’d have to stop doing so because he was “radioactive.” He predicted that everyone at Tesla would deny talking to him or being his friend.\s\sHe said this was something he’d become used to even though it didn’t stop people from visiting him coming to his dinner parties or asking him for money. (That was why Mr. Epstein told me without any trace of irony he was considering becoming a minister so that his acquaintances would be confident that their conversations would be kept confidential.)\s\sADVERTISEMENT\s\s\sIf he was reticent about Tesla he was more at ease discussing his interest in young women. He said that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable. He pointed out that homosexuality had long been considered a crime and was still punishable by death in some parts of the world.\s\sMr. Epstein then meandered into a discussion of other prominent names in technology circles. He said people in Silicon Valley had a reputation for being geeky workaholics but that was far from the truth: They were hedonistic and regular users of recreational drugs. He said he’d witnessed prominent tech figures taking drugs and arranging for sex (Mr. Epstein stressed that he never drank or used drugs of any kind).\s\sI kept trying to steer the conversation back to Tesla but Mr. Epstein remained evasive. He said he’d spoken to the Saudis about possibly investing in Tesla but he wouldn’t provide any specifics or names. When I pressed him on the purported email from Mr. Musk he said the email wasn’t from Mr. Musk himself but from someone very close to him. He wouldn’t say who that person was. I asked him if that person would talk to me and he said he’d ask. He later said the person declined; I doubt he asked.\s\sWhen I later reflected on our interview I was struck by how little information Mr. Epstein had actually provided. While I can’t say anything he said was an explicit lie much of what he said was vague or speculative and couldn’t be proved or disproved. He did have at least some ties to Mr. Musk — a widely circulated photo shows Mr. Musk with Ghislaine Maxwell Mr. Epstein’s confidante and former companion at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars party.\s\s“Ghislaine simply inserted herself behind him in a photo he was posing for without his knowledge” Ms. Sulprizio the spokeswoman for Mr. Musk said.\s\sIt seemed clear Mr. Epstein had embellished his role in the Tesla situation to enhance his own importance and gain attention — something that now seems to have been a pattern.\s\sAbout a week after that interview Mr. Epstein called and asked if I’d like to have dinner that Saturday with him and Woody Allen. I said I’d be out of town. A few weeks after that he asked me to join him for dinner with the author Michael Wolff and Donald J. Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon. I declined. (I don’t know if these dinners actually happened. Mr. Bannon has said he didn’t attend. Mr. Wolff and a spokeswoman for Mr. Allen didn’t respond to requests for comment on Monday.)\s\sADVERTISEMENT\s\s\sSeveral months passed. Then early this year Mr. Epstein called to ask if I’d be interested in writing his biography. He sounded almost plaintive. I sensed that what he really wanted was companionship. As his biographer I’d have no choice but to spend hours listening to his saga. Already leery of any further ties to him I was relieved I could say that I was already busy with another book.\s\sThat was the last I heard from him. After his arrest and suicide I’m left to wonder: What might he have told me?The good news is that that evidence still exists even tho he is dead.Is the New York Times drunk?lol show us your pulitzerReddit is run by an alt-righter""Traitor tells loser to state a military coup.""\s\sIs what the headline should read.He is basically mooning the entire country.Amazing. Wonderful proof of how Sinclair is the one on the wrong side of the truth and using his money to push his fox and false news agenda on everyone while pretending that he is not the one that is the actual danger to our democracy. Ironic right? Everything they’re saying is trueWhen I read the headline I immediately concluded what I would read next would be stupider than I could imagine but no it's even stupider than that.\s\sSeeing those spelling and formatting errors I just have to wonder if everyone working on this is drunk all the time or what...[I am pretty sure Sidney meant Quacken not Kraken.](https://memeguy.com/photos/images/release-the-quacken-50178.jpg)Release the CrackHead!Don Jr?Set up a fake University and then keep the money?

We're the worst.What the fuck...?How is this not entrapment?They mean the Trump campaign right...? why isn't this butt wipe back in jail already ?are any of the indicted or jailed ones still in there?  so many of them got out on such bogus excuses...he also had some weird live streaming election watch on you tube for the duration of the day and the count.\s\salso   trump was featured almost exclusively in the top banner during the live features offerings.  the banner was at least 4 inches tallNo kidding on space book zuckerberg gonna have some splainin to do 🤣Get your horoscope and read eviscerating comments- past and present- about Democrats in one sitting. Why Tim Stephens@ Astral  reflections would include a political commentary beats me. He’s both Canadian and claims to be bipartisan a “ moderate”. Another example of right wingers attempting to ingratiate themselves into the voting public with festering editorials of lies against the Democrats while declaring impartiality. Like Fox News OAN.How can the same bullshit be more bullshit?Translation: Hunter Biden laptop was a bust so we're grasping at straws to find a scandal to tip the race in Trump's favor.I’m guessing Murdoch’s had enough of this Biden crap and told them to pull the story.I bet it was Bigfoot and his team of leprechaun ninjas that work for Hilary out of a secret office in Area 51.Actually funny you mention that ... I have it from good source Obama is living in secret passages he had built  behind the White House walls running his Deep State Shadow Government still trying to grab everybody's guns to give to the Muslim Brotherhood and gaslighting Trump every chance he gets while watching and listening through the microwave whenever Trump nukes a Hot Pocket during one of his 3am tweet rants (after taking secret-Nunes-Intel from the bushes through the White House kitchen window...) as well as channeling the spirit of Saul Alinsky through the body of George Soros conjured up during one of John Podesta's pot luck seánce dinners catered by Comet Ping Pong Pizza... down in the basement of course... with Hillary Pelosi and Warren doing that topless hostess thing while former FBI head Comey is working hat check and Special Investigator Mueller is sitting in the corner strumming on the old banjo all as Chuck Schumer stokes the fire with Hillary's 3300 missing e-mails and Huma's in the kitchen washing cocktail glasses and bleaching hard drives\s\sDude has been crazy busy every day since out of office. \s\sOh and that good source now tells me that AOC did the cha-cha-cha with her Boriqua hombres down at the P.O. to get them to rifle through Tucker Carlson's mail. Grrl can crazzzeee dance make those uptight whitey males sure do sweat>out of a secret office in Area 51\s\s...from pizzashop.in the secret hidden  basement of the pizzaria on the base that only serves the visiting aliens from UranusLost in the mail! We totally had proof that Biden was guilty but it got lost in the mail. Holy shit is anyone stupid enough to believe thisHe averages around 5359000 views every show so I’d say at least 4.5 million Americans probably believe it when it first airs. After other “news” sources cite what carlson has said as a matter of fact I’d say they have between 5 - 7.5 million people believe it. Then like I get to endure at work these idiots spread this to like minded(mindless) idiots who eat it up and question nothing. \s\sAn example is a week or two ago idiots at work were happier than pigs in shit that Obama Clinton and Biden would all be arrested and charged with treason because trump released Russian disinformation as fact tying them to an illegal FBI probe. They wanted to know if they were going to sell tickets to the execution. \s\sIf you push back against their “facts” and “knowledge” you get nowhere. Debates are useless. I tried for the first 4 or 5 years of the decade I’ve worked with them and you honestly can’t help them so I just stopped.Dammit DeJoy you can't even fk thing up right! - Trump prblyHaha they're talking about this on r/tucker_carlsonI didn’t know that sub existed. I shouldn’t have looked at it. I need a shower. Fucking gross.I'm just a little bit disappointed by every day that passes without a large meteor falling from space and squashing Tucker Carlson like a bug.I'd settle for an empty school busGuess they never heard of scanning and email.""The Dog ate my homework"".""uh... and the resulting excretions were destroyed in a warehouse fire.""I think if I took the average Tucker fan reached out and ""took their nose"" then showed it to them they'd demand it back frantically.\s\sThey didn't make copies?  Take pics with their phones? Scan them?\s\sFucking unbelievable garbage.\s\sBut it's funny watching the desperation.Hahahahaahaaaaa Im so fucking tired of all this shit.Shoulda just gone with “my dog ate it”. Honestly more believable. If they did have truly incriminating evidence of the magnitude he’s making it out to be that’d be their holy grail “Comey email announcement” level dirt no way that just gets randomly dropped in the mail that shit would be hand carried in a briefcase chained to some dude’s wrist and hand delivered. Nope shoulda gone with a hungry dog.please correct me if am mistaken but didn't the godless emperor himself multiple times claim to have ' irrefutable concrete ' proof ' that then candidate Barrack Obama was secretly born in Kenya ? or was it Korea ? Kazakistan ? Kambodia ? Kanada ? Kleveland ?Tremendous Al Capone's vault energyMake up some new ones dumbass like the first ones and Tucker you're a terrible actor 😜The dog ate my homework.If Tucker Carlson says it it must be True.  It's on Fox News.Beware Joe Biden's Mail Ninjas.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sFuck it's no wonder I don't get any packages on time.Heh.  I initially read the post title as “lost only A copy” but it’s “lost THE only copy”.   So story is ended.  Damn.  Was looking forward to more Hunter Biden BS today.They never existed in the first placeso now its not actually physical documents but a flash drive.  who still ships a flash drive?  No drop box? no Google docs?  In the time of people working remotely they still would ""ship"" a flash drive?  Why no copies? it's already digital making copies takes less minutes.  Less time than filing out a shipping label.    Okay not saying its bullshit but either way Tucker's office is incompetent.Hmmm with help or a solo actTrumpers will probably blame Hillary for thatSomething something Killary.He was Epsteined.Wow amazed this isn't a bigger storyAnother hanging? I am suspicious. Nonetheless am very sorry for his family.Good.I want to make a “Benghazi” joke but I’m not sure if it’s no longer funny. Or if there’s a way to work in an “Emails” joke in this. You know with the bullshit conspiracy theories with Clinton and the like.It's a projection. As always.I'm actually staggered at how blatant this example of projection is.distractionNit pick the term NPC derives from Dungeons and Dragons before it was used for video game characters.  I don't understand the point of this campaign stuff like this only works when you try and make the account look real.  By using NPC as part of the name and using the grey cartoon avatars they make it obvious it's fake accounts.  Whats the point?Kinda hilarious actually. In early games only a few of the NPCs could be interacted with; and by interact I mean a little bit if text and maybe an item the rest were filler for ambience. Now these idiots who don't know how to interact with people are using the best example of interaction available to them. \sThey might say its because we keep telling them what a crook trump is (understatement I know) and the repetition feels like a script but I bet they bring politics into every conversation they can like a default.Considering the number of bots on their side it's totally projection.   \s\sThat and they finally figured that ""cuck cuck"" made them sound like a bunch of chickens. Classic republicidiot smear job completely without merit the more salacious the better. Remember senator McCains love child rumor?It has merit. The FBI has screencapped emails of the corruption for you to see.Owned by the facts ? You haven’t listed a single fact? Lol u got REKT CHECK M8What about Bobulinski and DOJ confirming Hunter is under investigation for money laundering ?Who in the DOJ confirmed this?Ohhhhhhh good.Because of course. Trump wishes he could sick the military on opponents."

The Oregon AG just filed a lawsuit against the federal agencies responsible for illegal arrests but in today's climate I can't help but be apprehensive about if that makes any real change.\s\sI mean...just snatching people off the street... That's some scary dystopian bullshit. There were some theories getting passed around for a while that the ""arrests"" were just fronts to extract federal agents infiltrating the protests but as I understand it that was debunked with an interview with one of the victims.I commented this on the other thread but i think it also applies here.\s\sNative portlander here whats happening is wild.\s\sIndividuals who are wearing whats basically combat gear (but no other identification) are taking protesters from the streets putting them in unmarked rental cars and doing god knows what with them.\s\sBecause since theyre feds theres no bail and whats even weirder once these protesters have been released theres no record of their arrest *anywhere*. They deny that theyve held specific individuals. So even though these protesters know that theyve been arrested they went through it they know their experience theres no proof that they were ever taken into custody. Which is unbelievably *sketchy* as fuck. \s\sPretty much all of our local officials have told them to leave but they dont have the authority to kick them out. \s\sSo just to really reiterate we have: individuals who you can't outwardly verify are police essentially kidnapping protesters in unmarked cars  then letting them go with no record that they were ever even held and theres *nothing* our local officials can do about it. \s\sIm not a conspiracy person at all but to me that sounds like its one step away from disappearing people. \s\sAnd its interesting because the protests in portland havent even been that violent. Off the top of my head i can think of half a dozen cities that have been worse so its odd that they are targeting us. In the beginning there were some more lively nights but for the most part its been community bbqs put on by a group called riot ribs that then turns into marches headed towards downtown. \s\sPeople have been posting a lot about this on the portland subreddit and obvi i can provide sources to all these claims but its late here and i need to get to bed.\s\sIm shocked that more news outlets arent covering this. Portland is essentially being invaded. At best trumps a fucking idiot (no surprise there) who doesnt understand the Constitution because policing rules aren't being followed right now. At worst hes knowingly going against the Constitution and this is a trial run for something much more dubious.Welp I know I'll be downvoted but its all so stupid.. here it goes IMO everything in that video is just wrong that's no innocent person or protester; they're dressed in riot gear are you all blind? You got people constantly damaging the area (which will just increase taxes to pay for fixing those buildings so everyone is setting themselves up to struggle down the road) and a mayor refusing to stop this damage for weeks which makes this a bad situation which needs to be calmed down. If officers came in police cars or detained that person at the scene of the crime then the rioters would ambush and beat them and throw items (which would lead to more forceful actions being made by the cops to protect themselves).   \sNow as for for the unmarked cars I can see it as both creepy and necessary necessary to not be easy to spot so they can find rioters and prevent damages but creepy in that you don't know who the heck they are or if they are affiliated with the local police or just some random strangers. They have patches on their arms and that should have been easy to get down for the people that were there in that video. Everything is just wrong here.Wearing a helmet=Riot gear gotcha.\s\sI guess all the Hong Kong Protestors are riotous dissidents who only forced violence on themselves too rite?\s\sYou people are so transparent.Thanks Trump Supporters!This is the crap half the country is afraid of. There is no reason for this and it will only cause more hard then good.Barr can suck itAs someone in a hospital bed listening to nurses talk to each other about things they're running out of. . . Fuck everyone who thought this was a good idea.I sincerely hope you get better.Not only is the US government refusing to use any of the federal stockpile they're stealing from hospitals to add to it!??!??!1) They are not confiscating/seizing/stealing hospital supplies. They are bumping orders.  An entirely different problem with entirely different solutions.  But it IS a problem and we need to discuss it honestly.  This article doesn’t do that.  Our media need to do better.  Mislabeling the problem will lead us to the wrong solutions.  \s2) They ARE using the national stockpile.  The unfortunate fact is that its not enough.   (Yet another problem)\s\sLet’s keep our eyes on the facts so we can debate on how to solve the ACTUAL problems.And then reselling those supplies back to the hospitals! Wtf!?!Misleading article and title.  Seizure is an inflammatory and inaccurate term.  The Federal Government is outbidding and superseding state governments when it comes to ordering supplies of PPE.   E.G. when state A orders 50k masks from supplier B sometimes the Federal government comes in a bit later and orders 1 million masks from supplier B forcing state A to get in line behind the Federal Government since the Feds have more $$$ and have the National Defense Production Act on their side.  Yes  State A is being bumped and that sucks.   But its not like the Feds are physically taking PPE that’s already deployed in a local hospital and ‘seizing’ it.   It’s entirely possible that the very same PPE may wind up back in that state at a later date at no cost to the state from the national stockpile.  \s\sIt’s by no means and ideal situation and indeed mistakes will be made.  But no matter how we allocate the limited amount of PPE mistakes are inevitable.  Let’s not make the situation worse with hyperbole and inflammatory language.It's like you're in line to order you order and then an asshole comes in and says hey make my massive order before theirs and fuck them if you run out and don't forget you HAVE to make mine first.\s\sI can't imagine anyone not feeling royally fucked after that interaction.There are many reports from many states that FEMA is showing up in hospitals and taking PPE and carting them off.   How is that not ""seizure.""Misleading articlehttps://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fwu2m0/_/fmr1x6r/?context=1\s\sI wanted to link to this guys comment in another subreddit also discussing this because he adds more context to this whole fiascoInhofe Loeffler Ron Johnson Feinstein & David Perdue need to lose their jobsIt should be noted that Dianne Feinstein's stocks are in a blind trust so unless we find evidence of illicit communication between her and her trust she should not be included on the list with the others. Her trust also sold stock in a biotech company which contrasts with Loeffler buying stocks in a teleworking company.She should resign and be subject to prosecution for insider trading.This is the only correct answerJust proves the point. Elected officials can’t own stock.Yeah...she needs to be voted out of officeOr you know resignYou have to have a Justice department who will prosecute.We should review statements by all congresspeople and their actions.  If they said it was a Democrat hoax and sold off they should be in jail.Her name is Loeffler that's German for Spooner like the literal spoon is called Loeffel or Löffel.Subscribed for German factsEveryone had 3 months to drop investments when they knew about Covid19 back in January.Wow that is wild. I had been wondering how all these could have popped up at the same exact time. This would be an investigative journalism field day if there's more to it*Puts Tin Foil hat on\s\sliterally sounds like the goal is to get as many people possible sick then when shit hits the fan internally someone is going to come in and fuck us in the assI'd say it's much simpler than that. Trump and the republicans (and the people pulling the strings at Fox and OANN who keep putting people on TV saying it) want the economy re-opened but if they just do it then they get the blame so you stir up these fake protests Trump supporters are crazy enough to then tag along to them thinking they're real which makes them bigger that puts pressure on the weaker governors to concede and reopen their states then Trump gets to point at them when death rates skyrocket.So this is either done by someone who honestly wants to ""reopen"" the country no matter the costs or who wants to get as many people as possible infected.\s\sCould be someone from either side either supporting Trump and wants to help the economy or someone who wants to make the virus spread further to make it clear he fucked up with his response.Part of the evidence provided is that the sites have links to the Trump administration through a company owned by his Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and the fact that at these sites where appearing at the same time Trump went out his ""Liberate"" tweets. This is almost certainly someone who supports Trump and believes this will help him and may in fact have some knowledge/sway in the Trump administration.So was it trump or the Russians? Or teamwork?YesThe people are the enemy of this administration. Divide and conquer.* *pretends to be shocked* *\s\sThe fires have been rising since 2018. Who is surprised that this is happening now? Who is really surprised they are just letting it burn?\s\s After Bolsonaro cuts the budget for non-profit that protected the forest. After he rejects international help.

0,ConspiracyII,Qult_Headquarters,125,"Jacob Wohl is a lying pos trying desperately to stay relevant. I don’t believe a word that comes out of his mouth.Wohl has a personality disorder of some sort. The dude seeks the most self destructive type of fame.You shouldn't the article even calls him ""the laughingstock of Washington dc""I followed him around like flies on shit since the day he joined Twitter. I called him out daily 24/7 365. He blocked about 70 accounts I made until he was banned. The shitty thing is im now broad Google banned from calling him out on Twitter now because I said the first lady is a hooker. Blows my mind the blue check marks can curse and say whatever but I call it like I see it and now I can't even access Twitter unless I go through tor. Twitter censors videos and images if you use a vpn. They also make you give them your phone number if you use a vpn. Fuck that shit. She's an escort.So let's get this timeline going.  June Maxwell makes a deal with Wohl to launch a smear campaign against her and Epsteins victims.  Around that time Wohls associate Jack Burkman (also a lobbyist) starts lobbying to have the SDNY AG Geoffrey Berman fired from his position.\s  \sMid June and Bill Barr tries to do exactly that Berman refuses to step down until he can ensure that his work will be seen through.  Once he does he steps down and 2 weeks later Maxwell is arrested on July 2nd.  \s\sYesterday and Trump denies knowing anything about the situation with Prince Andrew and wishes well on Maxwell.  \s\sNow idk about the rest of you but we all know how trump is how he acts and how he reacts.  When he is proud of something he will boast about it ad nauseum.  When he's uncomfortable with a subject he'll deny or speak very little about it.  Now if he were the one in charge of ""Q"" if he were the one running the show there is ZERO chance in any reality that he would not be aware of the situation with Andrew he was well aware of what Andrew had been up to according to himself in a 2015 interview with Hannity.  The Q's want to take some sort of credit for bringing down Andrew (he's been essentially removed from his public duty as a royal since early this year) then theres no plausible way that trump would be ignorant of his situation or would be trying to distance himself from Andrew in any fashion unless he knows that it could lead to him.   If arresting Maxwell was such a big deal to Q then why no tweet about it? (as far as I am aware he never tweeted about her arrest)\s\sSimply put he's in deep and he knows it and the house of cards that is Q is literally falling as we speak.It's wild to watch the Qultists ""connecting dots"" when there are clear uninterrupted straight lines that show the exact converse of all of their ""connections"".Imagine thinking ""we need a top guy to smear some people money isn't an object. Get me Jacob Wohl.""""Jacob Wohl: When James O'Keefe is out of your price range""There was a Twitter thread which claims this is just a bullshit put forward by Lil' Jacob to stay relevant and I'm willing to go by this assumption.\s\sLike Maxwell is a rich powerful VERY smart woman. Why the fuck would she hire a kid who manages to fuck up everything he does in the most horrible way? This kid thinks he's some kind of modern day Roger Stone but he's just a cunty rich kid who never stood a chance taking into account the father he has.This actually sort of sounds more realistic. The one thing that seems off about it is why would he ever want to associate himself (and by extension Trump) with her? I mean I get that he's a TOTAL dipshit but that seems like exactly the opposite of what anyone would ever try to do.\s\sI kind of feel like the whole story is bullshit. This is from the Daily Mail which is utter clickbait garbage. I mean I'd love to see all the bad guys tied together with a neat little bow but the more I think about it it reminds me of family members that told me they heard on a reputable website that Fauci's wife is Maxwell's sister.$25k buys a lot of drinks at a hipster coffee shop.Favorite Jacob Wohl moments:\s\sWohl posting on Instagram claiming that he was in Tel Aviv but no Tel Aviv skyline or any recognizable features instead he's in front of a wood fence that was later in the background of a shot captioned ""Minsk Belarus"".

He is not a hero or a journalist. He is an enemy of America who helped the 2016 Russian coup to install the kompromat puppet Donald Trump.Assange was also involved in stoking the Seth Rich BS [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/will-julian-assange-and-wikileaks-finally-tell-the-truth-about-seth-rich-918946/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/will-julian-assange-and-wikileaks-finally-tell-the-truth-about-seth-rich-918946/) and some of his underlings would give away the means to hack anti-Trump sites [https://heavy.com/news/2019/04/jason-fishbein/](https://heavy.com/news/2019/04/jason-fishbein/)....yeah Assange is not a hero.Yeah that part made me cringe.  I think Snowden or Manning would have been a better choice.Also he's a rapist.He he exposed the war the govt retaliated. His fuckery in 2016 was his retribution. I hate him but I get it.Do you have any sources for this? From what I’ve seen it looked to be communication between the Wikileaks twitter page and Stone and it was based around getting protection for Assange rather then them aiding republicans? I think they even deliberately mistimed some of the releases so it  didn’t coincide with what Stone was predicting. I am yet to see any smoking gun proving Assange is a Russian asset with the goal of supporting Trump but would be interested if I’ve missed something.\s\sEdit: wow downvoted for asking for a source yet nobody’s shared anything apart from assumptions?probably but he did serve a purpose in exposing what Snowden had that the MSM wouldn't print (Vault 7).  How necessary that was IDK considering that Snowden didn't really reveal anything more than Binney  already had revealed in the 90s. Anyway IDK if Assange was always a Russian asset or if he was forced into it by kompromat or his only alternative after the Feds went after him.Julian Assange has publicly stated why he helped Trump win. It was a calculated attempt to hobble the U.S. war machine. He thought the Democrats would become anti-war with Trump in office rather than expand the War on Terror with Hillary Clinton in office. The rationale being that Republicans are always pro war whereas the Democrats change their minds based on who’s in charge. It seems like he was right too.\s\sAssange also repeatedly stated that the leaked emails didn’t originate from a hacker but rather from someone who worked for the DNC. He also did not deny that Seth Rich might have been that source.Are there proof to that? And if it was true then it Trump could easilly use his influence to free a good ally and also you have to proof that he coordinated with Rogef and then that that coordination was sponsores by Russia and then that both new it was a russian op  so it doesnt seem very plausible\s\sHe still did a really bad thing by releasing those shady documents  thoHonest question... Why do people ignore the contents of the emails?  And only focus on the alleged source etc etc... Regardless of where they came from nobody disputes the validity of the emails. Nobody cares top secret US secrets were going through a private server? Everybody in military and high level government knows private servers are ZERO allowed. You cannot claim ignorance on this. It's drilled into your head at every clearance level and its common sense. The only reason a Secretary of State would do this is to hide communications and be exempt from FOIA requests etc. Anyway she absolutely should not have been elected President based on the revelations of the emails and private servers (or Secretary of State for that matter).  So I don't get it... If it was Russians shouldn't we be thanking them??   Same with Joe Biden.  Why aren't these criminals vetted BEFORE elections.  I'm glad info comes out before people vote. Thank you whoever releases this info. Wherever it comes from.I love this channel so much.Wiggy waggaThis video was absolutely hilarious. Q has gone off the rails and hurts conservatives more than helps.That photo of the brooks brothers riot looks like it has Kavanaugh in the backgroundRelated: her mouth movements bothered me so I stopped the vid.wait whats the conspiracy theory for Tom Hanks? Thats new to meThey say that he's one of the horrible celebrities that like drinks babies blood. He was given an honorary citizenship in Greece this year and Q went crazy about the theory that he was going to escape to Greece so that he didn't get rounded up by Trump's goons.Qultists are contrarians so given Tom Hanks reputation for being a pretty nice guy and relatively scandal-free they assume he's the most prolific Satanic pedophile in Hollywood.This is an irrelevant critique but the VO to the actress seems... off? Either in timing volume or complression I felt like I couldn't match the voice to the mouth.That is intentional it is a style they use across all their videos.It’s because juicemedia is run by Australians with Australian actors. They have an American voice actor dub over the lines of the Australian actors when the video is about American topics.I rarely comment on Reddit but this is fucking hilarious.HILARIOUS!!Can I get a source link for this to share the video?You should be able to click through to youtube but here is the link: https://youtu.be/1SoJI_KNV0QIs the actor Australian because that accent is perfect?Australian actor but dubbed by an american oneDeep in the rabbit's rectum.

Pretty sure not as many of them are intelligently wielding it as a political tool as you suspect.The only Qnatics who are aware it's bullshit are the grifters at the top of the food chain.

The Prime Minister has even publicly addressed the issue. So that explains it.It's referencing the attack on Biden.  Biden is catholic that's why they're highlighting it.  If he was a boy scout leader they'd have gone with that angle. \s\sAlso the catholic church is more international.  They're the largest single group.  It's the logical go-to target.  Protestants are a collection of different versions of christianity not a cohesive group. \s\sI guess the most accurate target would be 'christianity in general.What gets me is that the elections are fair and correct if only the republicans win otherwise there was an electron fraud. Can't they see the hypocrisy?\s\s\sWhat if Democrats screamed fraud when republicans win?What’s really interesting to me is Georgia turnout tonight. We often ask the question do they *really* believe all this absolute crap or are they just rationalizing being awful people?\s\sToday’s turnout would tells us that only maybe 15-20% of Republican voters in Georgia believed Trump’s claims. The rest of them trusted the election process well enough to cast their ballots again just two months after the November election. \s\sI think most of us would agree that generally the percentage of Republicans we’ve always figured were hardcore Qultists. The vast majority of the rest of them including the members of Congress who want to put on a Sedition Show tomorrow *damn well know better*.\s\sThe question: which one of these two sets of Republicans is truly the most awful? The gullible Qultists or the pretending masses? And could there be a tiny chance the Qultists might realize that 80% of their party doesn’t believe them or their God Emperor?They’re living in a fantasy world where Democrats aren’t actually people but a nebulous hoard of boogeymen and women who are using technology and demonic rituals to overtake the country. These are the people who thought Trump won 90+% of the popular vote and thought California flipped red in the “real” electoral maps. \s\sMost of them probably only interact with politics through their browsers or in their own social bubbles so many times they probably don’t even personally *know* any Democrats. When your whole worldview is filtered through that lens then it’s not too hard to get caught up in all of this propaganda. Democrats are always evil ergo they can’t ever rightfully win and everyone except for their qult leader Trump is in on the vast conspiracy and fraud. It wouldn’t even cross their minds that they’re being hypocritical because their minds place them in the middle of an action movie where they’re Parler-ing their way to saving the country in a neo-Revolutionary War one “boom” post at a time.I have family members who are like this. They simply can not conceptualize a world where someone believes differently from them and would have reason to vote differently. They really don't think anyone would disagree with their position.I had a stream on earlier and the rhetoric was nutty.

And that fuels convincing themselves of other conspiracy theories no matter how outlandish they may seem.That’s definitely what they’re saying. As to the what and how it’s a bit vague. I take it to partly mean that conspiracy cults de-legitimize actual criminal conspiracies. It makes it easy to write off say Russian collusion as “just another conspiracy theory.”It’s referring to any “conspiracy coming to light.” The further prosecution of Epstein and any evidence that may surface because of it counts. In addition to recent exposures of government officials real or perceived of which Trump would fall under.I think they are saying real issues in the government might get interperted under the qanon lens despite them being totally separate. Like they find some senator who is a pedo and now they are like ""it is all true.""This sounds like bad news and they are obliquely toeing the Trump line. The government officials are Comey Strzok etc. All the people Trump fired essentially. The document **specifically mentions QAnon** a shadowy network that  believes in a deep state conspiracy against President Trump and  Pizzagate the theory that a pedophile ring including Clinton associates  was being run out of the basement of a Washington D.C. pizza  restaurant (which didn’t actually have a basement). \s\s&#x200B;\s\s🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Reading the comments under the article Qultists seem to think that reporting of Qanon is just the deep state trying to stop them. just unbelievable.They'll be yelling about their status as Military Intel as they're lead away in handcuffs never understanding what's going onSpecifically they will say “Panic! Panic I tell you! This proves *everything*!”\s\sIt proves of course what we’ve said all along. That although they aren’t all violent or mentally unstable they most definitely attract an inordinate number of the people who are. Then their ridiculous “theories” which don’t even qualify for that definition ratchet up that person’s crazy. And anything can happen. \s\sJust yesterday at midnight yet another Qanon prediction went down the toilet when he promised “24 hour warning”. Because he trusted sketchy Joe DeSomebody who makes a living being super effective at predicting shit that never happens. So now Q a false prophet is copying off the paper of other false prophets...and yes eventually their craziest disciples are going to continue to snap. Thank you FBI.I was looking at the qanons on twitter and they seem to think that it's fake news by CNN or other media outlets clearly not understanding that the FBI released a memo naming QanonThey also think the media is afraid to say anything about Q. \s\sPretty convenient when you have justification for any situationoVeR tHe TaRgEtGreat. I just noticed yesterday that someone at my workplace has a QAnon sticker on their vehicle.So the FBI has to know who is behind it right?Not necessarily. If they aren’t conducting an active investigation or didn’t already finger the individual during the development of this product then said individual may still be anonymous.No or maybe not yet. They've just identified it as one of many radicalizing conspiratorial beliefs.OF COURSE!

We've overthrown governments just to take what we want from them.\s\sEveryone's own country gives them the sanitized version of their history. The US is not alone in that regard. We actually do a lot of good shit in addition to meddling in everyone's business and it's worth keeping that in mind.\s\s>Why is it that the rich get tax breaks and normal people get shit? Why are they seemingly untouchable?\s\sBecause they bought out the soul of the Republican party decades ago and the morons they're screwing keep voting for them anyway. The broader issue is campaign finance which enables the rich to dump their millions into getting their favored candidates reelected so that they can continue stacking the deck for the rich. If you don't like getting screwed support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo.\s\s>If Hiliary was elected can you imagine how bad that would look?

Genuinely asking. Most people 30+ care about politics and corruption and they did before Trump. Trump's main focus is how everything will look on TV so that has the consequence of making everything in politics more watchable. If what you mean by people not caring actually has to do with the results everything about Trump's presidency should horrify you as much as it horrifies me. This is corruption and disregard for the rule of law on a scale our country has never seen before. Do you care about that?Are we talking 9-11/Chemtrail conspiracies or qanon conspiracies?\s\sBecause the first set is harmless and true.

I know some moderates who were Obama voters but watched Fox news during Obama's presidency. Tucker Hannity et al. They are going over their contracts as we speak. I predict Biden is winning and we will pretty much know on the morning of Nov. 4th.Full disclosure I’ve been predicting a surprise Trump win for six months now. But the abundance of polling has finally given me hope that I’ve been wrong. \s\sBased on probabilities according to 538 you’re right we have a solid chance for the networks to call it for him Tuesday night. \s\sAlso totally agree that Reich wing outlets do far better under a Dem administration. I can remember decades ago I said on a message board that it sounded like Limbaugh wanted Clinton to get a second term. I fully believed it then and in the present day I’m convinced they know they’re better off if they can make a victim out of Trump as he exits the WH.\s\sThe reason is very simple. Republicans have no platform so they only work as an anti-change party. Especially now that Bush II soured them on permanent war-making they have nothing left. \s\sThe so-called “intellectual” arm of the party used to be able to claim their platform was fiscal conservatism. But now that Trump has exploded the deficit and borrowed like a drunken sailor that lie has been exposed. \s\sCarlson and Hannity will get a good 20% ratings bump if Biden wins. They’ll have no trouble whatsoever keeping the old viewers scared out of their wits. Incredibly they were decent at it with Republicans in every branch of government. But it’s gonna be so much easier now.I had to give my dad a heads up bc he’d probably believe it and be like “look here’s proof!!” He’s not in the Q rabbit hole but has said “the Biden crime family” and shit like thatSo he’s a middle-aged white man from a red state?Excellent that’s what we’re here for! Can’t guarantee he will accept a wild and far out news source like the National Broadcasting Company. (These folks usually go for something with “True” or “Real” in the title...because well duh it says it’s *true* right there!)\s\sBut hopefully this will help you convince him that some things or true whether he believes them or not. And vice versa.The worst part about Q is that sometimes they parrot legit conspiracy theories.... but give them a hard Right Wing Slant...   \s\s\sCausing people to associate real phenomenon with Q and thus they forget it.  \s\s\sQAnon is the best player on the Elite's team“No this is the fake news. The documents are clearly legitimate”\s\s— half of the people still voting for Trump\s\sSo it’s still works because people believe what they want to believe. Giuliani probably knew he’d get caught. As long as it’s the ‘fake news media’ who calls him out the documents are real.This is true but the good news is it won’t get a single new person to the polls or to change their vote. They’re banking on Trump’s base being far larger than it probably is based on crowds at rallies. \s\sNobody denies there are a few million people who would literally walk off a cliff for Trump. This is a very very literal cult...that word is not just an insult. \s\sBut feeding them for the past three months at the expense of appealing to suburban white women was likely a fatal error.The people voting for Trump aren't going to be seeing these news anyway.This is so pathetic. Imagine if they were actually good at this stuff.Ironically I think that the more cultists they draw in the less effective they are at being taken seriously. The Q noise machine is out there throwing everything at the wall to the point that they're talking about aliens and extradimensional beings of light and darkness along with the usual Tom Clancy malarkey. It's about as silly as trying to tie together every whacko concept from Farscape and Star Trek into a single coherent plot.This is literally the fake news I have heard them whining about for years. The displays of complete amorality and willingness to sink to new depths because one perceives their enemy already there blow my mind.Don't have anything to add but I love your username.It is amazing how easily all of this Hunter stuff they are trying has fallen apartCredit where it is due.\s\sI really believe Pelosi and Schiff took this all away from them back in November.\s\sThe Trump campaign was counting on that Ukraine scandal to make up for the 25 year republican smear campaign head start they enjoyed with HRC. \s\sSenate removal or no the impeachment had the benefit of rendering the public deaf to anymore""Hunter Biden"" CTs and useless to the Trump campaign.Shit was so crazy even Trump's dad called it for what it was and spoke out against it.Our world has become this weird blend of equal parts 1960s CIA disinformation campaign and *Snow Crash-*esque science fiction.  It is a very weird time to be alive.A world full of Howard Beals all shouting out their windows.I can't help but think if being called Mr. Balding everyday may not have had something to do with the professor's motivations for spreading disinformation. Surely after years of that you'd just want to watch the world burn.For reasons I don't fully understand Glenn Greenwald just quit the Intercept (the site he founded) today over this stuff.Greenwald can't report on a story.

I have ignored him for a while so I don't know the back story but it was surprising to me.I mean we knew QAnon has been a larp for 3 years now. One of the Bakers(because they 'leave crumbs to follow) fucking logged as Q on 4Chan same tripcode and all on live streamNo shit?I know this is a trivial point but kudos to Martin Aspen for picking a pseudonym that no-one in the entire country of Switzerland had.  \s\sI don't know the chances of that statistically but it can't be easy.My immediate thought upon reading that was that there are no Swiss named “Aspen”.

Dissapointed...[deleted]This article isn’t about the emails that Glenn Greenwald was talking about...Ok. Um. A) This refers to a random "" intelligence document"" created months ago. Correct? \s\sB) focusing on this document Mr Balding stated sources needed to remain anonymous therefore half the article is about AI face generation. This is moot point given the anonymous nature stated. But ok. Also it stands out as desperate attempt to fill 10000 words and focus on something entirely irrelevant. AI face generation detection is the focus of the article. Suspect.\s\sC) New evidence from multiple new sorces including Biden business associate who appeared at Trump press conference before final debate. The article you posted took half its time over AI faces and didn't mention any new evidence:  the evidence people are actually talking about!  (I never heard of this ""intelligence document"" until this article) and the news cycle is about the NEW fresh evidence piling onto Joe Biden. \s\sConclusion. \s\sThis is disenguinine dog shit.>This is disenguinine dog shit\s\sDisenguinine is a new word on me. Did I spell it right?\s\sAt any rate most Americans clearly see dog shit as desperately seeking smut on a candidate’s family member when the incumbent opponent has already broken every ounce of convention regarding nepotism. \s\sTrump and team have always always leaned in hardest against the things he and they are guilty of. And while that plays well with the base at their most ignorant it fails to impress beyond that. \s\sIt remains apparent that clowns like Rudy and Steve are expected to save an election by creating some reason the other guy is surely worse. \s\sThe problem: almost nobody in America is worse or else there would be one single national leader somewhere on the globe who failed to contain a contagious virus as bad or worse than Trump did. \s\sThat isn’t the case. That leaves you with a minority percentage of selfish people who think that because they’re young or healthy enough not to die that means those who may die should volunteer to do so. \s\sWhat this minority is missing is most young and healthy people have someone they actually love who would die from “herd immunity”.\s\sFurthermore a real leader who believed in herd immunity would have instituted that program immediately. What happened here in reality was simple incompetence...the inability to set a vision to unify state leaders and to execute on a coherent plan. And once that became apparent our “leadership” just gave up.\s\sTrump is a failure and the activities of his opponent’s son is a pathetic smokescreen attempt to cloud that absolute fact.You realize this is a completely separate [old] document than the stuff that’s currently being talked about right? Please tell me you know that... It seems like some people in the comments don’t know thatWhich made-up document should we be paying attention to?\s\sSo it’s old? How old does information have to be to be regarded as unimportant to the Qult? It’s clear that four year old drops don’t matter since Muller was not working on bringing down anyone but Trump and Obama and Hillary and Podesta are still free.\s\sHow long before whatever horseshit you are peddling is considered to old for you to use as a kudgel? It’s irrelevant to us immediately. How long before it’s irrelevant to you?If they tire of Trumps act they may move to worshipping Flynn as they're new god.\s\sThey should arrest Flynn now."

His death was definitely suspicious but there is no proof whatsoever about who if anyone had something to do with it. There are literally hundreds of things that trump has done that we know about that support his impeachment. Let's focus on that.The guy ran a pedophilia ring among the super rich. You think that’s not worth focusing on? Trump is in the news 24/7 for all the impeachable things he did we don’t need more trump.Ding ding ding BINGO we have a winner!\s\s&#x200B;\s\sThis. \s\s&#x200B;\s\sThank you.Thank you Jesus that there is someone contributing actual facts in the comments and not more of the same conspiracy bullshit.\s\sI'm not going to discredit any information but it has to be information not the fucking conspiracy wet dreams of most of you clowns. You can speculate as much as you want but your speculation isn't worth shit. You want to speculate? Go to Trump's twitter feed where fantasy thrives. Keep your fantasy out of serious discussion.You don't hang yourself cleanly in a jail as if you have a high ceiling and a nice fall to break your neck with. You do it by making a very tight short rope around your neck tied to a bed and then push yourself away as much as you can until you pass out or your instincts take over to save yourself. That's strangulation.I thought people who were hanged WERE strangled. And often had their necks broken too.More common in older people for it to break. Common enough from hangingEvery day since his death I've had to scream at my monitor ""Stop turning this into a conspiracy!""This article is stupid! It doesn't confirm anything except putting doubt in people's minds.Jeffy is not fucking dead!CriminalAll GOP are criminals.It isn't criminal. Her husband runs the new York stock exchange so it's definitely legal.Horse Faced Criminal.Well then there's trump who's friend is profiting from the test kits which is why they wouldn't use the Cdc one weeks ago or it looks like they anywayHow is this not considered insider trading?I think it is. Who can deal with proving it right now?There's four of them so far I believe.Do tell?I used to think anarchists were just idiots but recently i've noticed that people with power will always use that power for personal gain. I'm tired of being ruled by people that always get better than the people that they rule it's fucking sick. I'm almost certain that i read the same story concerning the 2008 crash and it's  not unique at all. \s\sAbsolute power corrupts absolutely but any power corrupts in a relative way.I do see where you're coming from but anarchists are still idiots. The idea that we're all going to live happily in small self-regulating communities is a fantasy especially in an age of climate change & pandemics.\s\sWhat we need is properly enforced regulation checks and balances. Maybe Trump will be the wake up call.How many Democrats are doing this?\s\sEver notice that it's the GOP and the hyper-religious that touch kids rape and steal?\s\sThe point is: Never put people in government who tell you the biggest problem in your life is the government.The answer to the recognition of the essential nature of man being selfish and corruptible is not anarchy it is the strong rule of law and institutional checks and balances on the power of individuals OR as we now know that the founding fathers did not clearly understand associations of individuals / parties.jail time should be right around the corner...anyway it would be for anyone else like oh say Martha Stewart .If Martha Stewart wasn't immune I can't see it happening here with them either.Martha Stewart was rich but she didn’t have political power.  Not that I’m saying that makes it right but kinda the way things are currently.Every death every person not able to pay rent or the electricity bill is the direct responsibility of the GOP.I wonder what all the poor trailer trash living paycheck to paycheck in her podunk district think of thisAs long as she supports guns they probably don’t care. Poor GOP voters are the most illogical people in the countryThey're still wondering if it was chicken stock or beef stock.Republicans gonna RepublicanThe rot starts at the top of the GOP and flows all the way down. Grifters as far as the eye can see.Name and shame time to vote her outI know this isn’t exactly insider trading but is there some sort of legal ground to stand on to remove these criminals?From the article:\s\s>	It’s illegal for members of Congress to trade on non-public information gleaned through their official duties.Her husband is president of the NYSELet's just fucking occupy wallstreet again.Coward filth. Hands down.Wow who could have imagined that a narcissistic hate-filled despicable charlatan who pretends to define the boundaries of an entire religion would turn out to be a fraud? What are the odds?Deeper and deeper.  Gaetz is drowning in a cesspool of shit of his own making.  I like.Just imagine just picture if you will what would be happening right now if Gaetz was a Democrat.This entire criminal cartel needs to go to a deep dark prison for the rest of their vile sociopathic worthless lives.Purchasing one of these should zero out your credit score.Owning one certainly zeros out your IQ.14.99 per card. Terrorists I mean patriots can then then load them with all of their money so trump can spend it as he sees fit.. on himself of course..It is pretty strange to want to carry the equivalent of ISIS membership cards. At least when they get arrested they'll know it was the right person who was at the capital only because the trip was paid for by the GOP.Why do I get the feeling a purchase of one of these will come with reoccurring payments….Still misspelled Offal Card.Ok so I've been seeing this alot since these cards came out but can't find anything about it. What is it?As if everyone doesn’t already have a [Trump card.](https://i.imgur.com/eIINXV8.jpg) 🤷🏼‍♂️Is that the eagle from the nazi swastika logo making a guest appearance?No. It's not a guest appearance. It's the star of the (shit) show.Offecal is more like it.oh man now it'll be ""License Registration and Trump Card"" in the south.Too bad Osama bin Laden and ISIS lacked the imagination to have done something similar for their supporters.They have definitely embraced the whole Nazi motif haven't they.Can’t read without the app on mobile what was misspelledhttps://i.imgur.com/Yxt7LrM.jpgOffical not Official.It was supposed to be OF FECAL.Fucking Hitler would have done the same shit and I'd bet both of the cards would look eerily similar.It’s just hard to fathom that someone could be that big of a jackass and still have a massive egoIsn't that eagle very close to the Nazi imagery?\s\sEdit: yup...\s\shttp://globalnews.ca/news/8087932/donald-trump-card-eagle-nazi-third-reich/Vista Print must have fucked up.I suggest it be named the Trump ""Offal"" Card.  That'll do er.  \s\sWhy is Comrade Trumpski not in a prison cell?Pretty happy that I haven't had to hear him speak or read words he's written more than once this year.Another thing he picked up from Russia.Is this the Offical Covfefe? The one that diverts hurricanes and injects sunlight into your lungs?\s\sBecause if it isn't I'm not buying one.Shouldn't this be a TRUMP OFFAL card? I mean really.What exactly does the card do? Is it just an identification card for idiots or does it get them a discount membership to Mar-a-lago and a date with Jared? Edit: does it come with a Qanon decoder ring?Puts money in trumps pocket.  And it’s one more item the police will remove from the pocket of an insurrectionist.Call me crazy but I’m starting to suspect that some of these obvious fuck ups are an intentional move so that their opponents constantly underestimate team Trump as stupid enough to constantly do it accidentally. We know the Trump base won’t care but they can’t actually be that stupid can they?Offically the wurst hooman evr[removed]Hi rlovelock it looks like your comment to /r/Impeach_Trump was removed because you used either a link shortener or link redirect.

Lindsey Graham and Jim Jordan are spreading.To be clear:\s\sa) There are no 24/7 protests against Fox News which means there is not even enough motivation in the American people to bring awareness to this topic.\s\sb) American people deny to teach their own about them being wrong. Being a Fox News viewer doesn't exclude people from society they are still part of society and their lies are considered opinions rather then what they are: lies.\s\sThe problem is not that Fox News exists the problem is clearly that Americans are easy vulnerable for this kind of stuff and that they will never stand up for reality facts and science. It is not in their mentality. You can see that now by the huge majority of Biden in the presidentical candidate run. Biden is so far away from reality that it would be like cementing the history for America being the most stupid and easy manipulatable people on the planet.After 1/6 the GOP should be banned from operating as a political party in the U.S. since they have become a terrorist outfit.Yes.  But how?How conveniently unlucky huh?Ya uh huh sure....  They would have had 87 copies if this was remotely true.That’s a low balled number they would of made thousands of copies and plastered them all over the internet and every news outlet in America all within 2 hoursI was thinking the same thing.

It's amazing how close to 40 percent of the overall population he can draw anyway.There are no other options besides he is lying.  He is a liar  it is what they do.   I used to really believe that people in general  were smart.  It turns out that I just surrounded myself with smart people and the more people you meet outside of that circle you have cultivated for yourself you realize exactly how absolutely fucking stupid the vast majority of people are.

There was just a Federal Court ruling that ""you can't REALLY believe what he says and you should know that""  and then since the statement ""Federal Court Ruling"" wouldn't come out of their stupid fucking pie holes unless they were trying to take rights away from some group of disadvantaged people that has escaped their ire until now they just go on happily believing that this piece of fucking trash - that kind of looks like a chipmunk that everyone loathes - will go on spouting insane untruths and his big fat red hat inbred shitheals will continue to vote directly to their own detriment.when exactly can we prosecute this asshole for his god damn lying fucking bullshit.

Mother Tucker was in possession of incriminating evidence of Biden corruption but forgot to make a copy befoe mailing it from DC to California.  It was lost.

If you have documents that nail Biden you stay up all night and digitize them if you need to. There is never just going to be one copy. And how did he get this copy? Did a hacker group actually mail physical copies or fax them? No that is absolutely absurd just like this entire story.

You can always have recent emails by subscribing to some high-volume mailing lists. Do everything you want to keep private in the virtual machine including the email social media and web browsing you don't want seen. Toss some stuff into your laptop desktop trash so it doesn't look empty. Have a beautiful patriotic-looking background image. Use a VPN inside your virtual machine.\s\sBy the way the agents lied to the author when they said he was not allowed to have an attorney. Ask for an attorney and if they refuse ask them to cite the authority under which they are refusing. My inclination -- about which I have not talked to a lawyer yet -- is to recommend that you then wait a few minutes and ask them if you can call your family to let them know you won't be able to pick up children from somewhere. Don't lie just ask for permission. Whether they let you or not call your family tell them where you are say you won't be able to be there until further notice and ask them to have a lawyer call you back. If they try to keep you from contacting a lawyer that's much worse than simply lying to you telling you that you aren't allowed to call one and if they try to prevent a return call you might have a very solid case.\s\sNone of this is legal advice and I am not an attorney so talk to an attorney about all of it before acting on any of it.No. \s\sAccording to the article they simply badgered him until he gave them the passwords then they searched his phone and laptop very carefully.1. http://old.reddit.com/r/ufo/comments/c3q7uw/catherine_austin_fitts_in_a_very_interesting/ersg9v1\s\s2. http://old.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/asnmu1/washingtons_paralysis_requires_a_constitutional/egvet2g\s\s3. http://old.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/9vuh4b/the_dea_and_ice_are_hiding_surveillance_cameras/e9f372q\s\s4. http://old.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/9tjr5w/american_exceptionalism_when_others_do_it/e8wq72m\s\s\s5. http://old.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/c3tpts/who_are_the_real_terrorists_by_richard_e_browning/ert3qak"

One of the dozens that were completely ignored?One of the dozens pressured by Cohen and mostly impossible to try due to the difficulty of obtaining evidence.\s\sThis will likely never be looked into.  : tDeath threats lots of death threats the SOP of anyone the ~~terrorists~~ right wing gaslighters want to silence. Like Dr. Fauci and his kids and and and....Yea the woman got a bunch of death threats so she dropped the suit which means it never happened.Yeah these lawsuits all.coming out in 2016 is the one thing holding me back in buying it 100%. If these lawsuits were filed in 2005 or something or other id latch on and demand true investigations.>The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein including Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein knew that I was 13 years old.\s\s>Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump Defendant Trump tied me to a bed exposed himself to me and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual attack I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.\s\s...But but Biden! and his touching!I'm kind of all for referring to Donald Trump as Defendant Trump from now on.BUT HUNTER BIDEN'S TAXES!!!!  /sBiden positions little girls for photos! The absolute monster!Oh Trump was just doing as celebrities do. Don't take everything he does so seriously.\sBesides the girl shouldn't have been there in the first place.\s\s/S!!!!You mean Biden and his accusations of sexual assault and misconduct right? I'm not defending trump at all and I'm glad he didn't win the election but let's not forget Biden is a piece of shit as well.Por que no Los dos? Biden is still a creep but Trump is a straight up monster. I’m not sure how either is debatable at this point....are you actually defending Biden's weird child touching? You're just as crazy as the fucking alt right.You would think Qanon would know this...Most of them who have ignore it however I have seen cases where the most extreme of their followers have tried to justify it by saying Trump had to rape the girl in order to infiltrate Epstein’s pedo ring in order to expose them and take them down. Sick fucks.They don’t do their research unlike usThey know they just dont care because trump is their guy.  Just like the number of cases that came out with Q pushers who had kiddie porn on their computers.Qanon was probably created to distract from trump's own pedophilia. Everything Trump and associates do is projection - accuse others of what you are doing yourself.Qanoners project many do partake in pedophiliaIs this the same case that trump had been trying to block DNA evidence from being introduced? Which is very telling because if he's innocent and there's DNA it would exonerate him?No totally different case. The DNA one is the writer E. Jean Carroll.Unreal. \s\sHopefully those text messaged threats were of enough veracity and arrogance that it actually is proof. \s\sThis is pretty revolting and deeply distressing.\s\sSo all those ""Epstein didn't kill himself memes"" worked?Of course he did. We should add child molestation to crimes that Trump has committed (which there are many)Rape. Child rape.I'm unable to download this. When was this filed? Has it been available \s?It's been available. I for one have been trying to bang this drum for years. Unfortunately it seemed like after 2016 no one was really receptive to the ""Trump is a rapist"" argument since most uninformed people just assumed ""well if there was anything to those stories he wouldn't be president now""Here's the entire docket:  https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4524664/doe-v-trump/\s\sEnjoy.1994I’m still in shock more people didn’t take this seriously. Every time I would mention this and even send them the documents I saved on my computer all they can say is.... well he wasn’t proved guilty...... ARE YOU FING KIDDING ME. Makes my brain spin in circles to even try to understand how anyone could support him.Serious question - what happened with this case ?I read somewhere that the accuser dropped the case her lawyer citing that she was being harassed and threatened by Trump’s people. Obviously can’t be verified but seems pretty easy to believe.I think Katie Johnson was moving forward with it in 2015 and stopped due to threats.  I also think that Tiffany Doe has since corroberated her own role in procuring girls for Epstein and swears to have witnessed Katie being assaulted by trump.\s\sForgive me for not refreshing my memory I'm already queasy this morning.Voluntarily withdrawn in early Nov at the same time Trump's fixer/bagman/lawyer convicted felon Michael Cohen was writing big checks for women's silence>Plaintiff was subject to acts of rape sexual misconduct criminal sexual acts\ssexual abuse forcible touching assault battery intentional and reckless infliction of emotional\sdistress duress false imprisonment and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury by the\sDefendants that took place at several parties during the summer months of 1994. The parties\swere held by Defendant Epstein at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant\sEpstein at 9 E. 71st St. in Manhattan. During this period Plaintiff was a minor of age 13 and\swas legally incapable under New York law of consenting to sexual intercourse and the other\ssexual contacts detailed herein\s\sNow that's quite something. I hope Trump gets locked up for anything at one point. Spending the rest of his life in prison would suit him just right.That legal document is an allegation by an anonymous prosecution it's not watertight  proof. While it's almost certainly true it's a bit click-baity to present it as gospelit's as valid has the ""hundreds of affidavits"" and ""sworn testimony"" regarding election fraud thoughIt may a different case but we have one case where two underaged sex workers for Epstein confirmed that Trump was there and engaged with one of the underaged prostitutes. He was also confirmed to be at the location during the time they alleged. That's more air-tight than any of a billion cases convicting minorities and poor people.Here's the whole docket.\s\shttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4524664/doe-v-trump/\s\sThe fact is the preponderance of evidence in Doe v. Trump & Epstein shows that in 1994 Donald J. Trump raped a 13 year old girl.Except that there were very credible witnesses backing the claim. They all backed off after death threats.Yup. An when asked to physically show up it was withdrawn from court. This accusation is years and years old. I hate Trump but i feel this was done out of malice by someone.Conservatives: ""what the hell? I hate affa Davids now.""You would think Qanon would know this...he will be joining his vermin child raping buddy soon enough.Put this in r/all. Let's upvote this shitI wonder who had him killed?The right wing only knows one thing: projection.Now we get to watch a bunch of fools who use the phrase ""pedo Joe"" on the regs wheel around and gum the word ""alleged"" out of their meat flaps like it's going out of styleThe mansion had cameras in every room. This is the tape the Russians have.The Greedy Old Pedophiles know he rapes children. That's why they worship him.Same age as Ivanka was at the time. The slap and yelling he could do what he wanted  sounds exactly like trump.This has been out there for years. The case has been dropped several times. It’s not gonna go anywhere. That doesn’t mean he didn’t do it but I don’t think the case is going anywhere.\s\sBy the way… Look into the deposition that Ivana Trump signed about when he raped her. It’s horrific.Called it trump is worse than OBL and El Chapo combined.\s\sEven the child shit is there also i doubt obl or chapo would betray its own country.\s\sStop that fucker you all pretend he is fearing consequences and it is but still has police and arny	 N@Zi bitch ass cowards infiltrated both.\s\sThey are planning a demonstration in January and trump will use that to declare a redo of voting now that he knows he is left 40 electoral votes to win.\s\sStop doing hashtags move or fall on your permissive and passive kneels.well which is it Jane or Tiffany? clearly you can't be trusted /sHow are more people not talking about this?I cannot tell you how many times I have posted about this including links and it’s like they don’t care at all.\s\sI keep wondering what it would it would take to make them realize the kind of garbage they’re supporting. Then I start to think why would they care? If you’re that kind of person you have no empathy anyway.https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/08/fact-check-doe-v-trump-epstein-filing-is-not-proof-trump-is-a-rapist.htmlHow can we prove that this document is actually legal material and not something made in Microsoft Word?So this is an allegation made in a civil suit. It's not a criminal conviiction. The plaintiffs are seeking damages. trump may have done it but no one has gathered any evidence so that he could be tried and convicted. \s\si believe that the 2 victims in this trial settled.This country is fucked.\s\sEdit: this doesn't appear to be a real story. Does anyone have a true source?Well you're talking about a ""real story"" and a ""true source."" Those are two different things and this is definitely the latter. This is a court document this is about as valid as a source as you can get. If you're looking for an article that someone has written describing the court case--which would use this document as its source--you might be looking for something like this. \s\s[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit)I checked Pacer by the case number and by the attorney's name --no record foundYou had me till I checked the URL.It's a genuine legal document. I'm not sure what's wrong with the URL unless you're one of those who hates the words ""fact check"" because it always comes out badly for Republicans.Fact check: completely falsejust as credible as all the affa davids  that the trumpets are signing :PThis info came out months ago and even the so-called liberal media wouldn't touch it.

I mean Trump was accused of sexual assault/harassment by numerous women and that wasn’t a problem for them.

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.This has been happening for ages... here's 4 videos from as long as ~5 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PStpvviPgxk&list=PLHTDmkg9apDz2qyZ6nqhCZC5cBx7SdkJiI’m not sure this video is about politics so much about the danger of consolidation of media. Well... Sinclair Broadcasting is a far right corporation. Some of these must runs are just straight-up assaults on dangerous liberals and also attack national media like CNN and NBC.\s\sEveryone should remember that back in 2004 Sinclair Broadcasting was responsible for broadcasting the highly controversial Swift Boat documentary that damaged Kerry's campaign at the 11th hour. It was Sinclair who decided to drop the documentary late enough where any correction or retraction wouldn't occur until after the election.\s\sSinclair caught shit for that but they were much smaller at that time. They have grown exponentially since then and now Ajit Pai has used his position at the FCC to smooth over another major merger that will push Sinclair into the realm of one of the nation's largest singular owners of local news broadcasting.\s\sThere is a decided and completely thought out logic behind this expansion. Most of the markets this group has control over are in rural areas or in areas that have a solid conservative core. Think inland California or Florida or some rural New England towns.\s\sThis is a targeted information campaign aimed at those people who still absorb their news off of social media. People over the age of 55 still consume a heavy amount of their news from local news broadcast which has withstood the major political bias that most national media is linked to today.\s\sSo if you constantly feed this audience ideas that the stuff they hear on Fox is right on the money and the other outlets are all lying bastards... And this is a subtle shift because the station switched ownership yet the same broadcast team is on the air it lends more authenticity to places like Fox and Breitbart who have an extremely insidious agenda.\s\sIn one respect you are right it is about the dangers of media consolidation but that's just still in the theoretical. What is being presented as an even more pressing concern is **who is currently executing the consolidation and what is their agenda?**\s\sEdit: format\sI would argue that the consolidation of media is a very important political issue.The stations were forced to run a deep state segment. \s\shttps://t.co/HDewjXUuJyIt's at #1 w/ 100k votes on r/all now although in the comments they describe how it has been removed and replaced numerous times. Must be a mod disagreement. this is what the left has been warning about for years:  the conglomeration of media outlets creating one message.  so far for the past 3 years it has repeated through all of it's channels that any news that is left of the owners' opinions is far left.  like not only is climate change a liberal agenda but that liberals are inherently bad.  it's fake news.\s\sour trumpy boi in the white house has fallen prey to this and we all suffer the consequences.Tonight on corporate news: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength!V for vendetta I couldn't agree more but ironically Fox is one of the worst offenders ... sooooooooooo.It's on r/television with a 112k upvote.  I don't think this is being ignored.I am Sinclair. Plz trust. Otherwise you're a danger to my democracy.\s\sLet's transcribe the message into simple phrases like that.\s\sNow the word “democracy” doesn’t sound like a word anymore.What the actual fuck. amazing videoInteresting that when I searched ""videos"" on the mobile app to find the sub the top three results were:\s\sr-videos\s\su-videos\s\sr-the_donald\s\s\sHmm...Submedia channel zero and Kpfk when I'm driving with my grandmaTo be fair their #1 rule is : No Politics.\s\sThey also have a link to their Political Video subreddit.  \s\sJust sayin.The title and video was hardly political. And others are saying that they scrambled to come up with a different excuse at first. Capitalism == communism when it comes to propaganda?In the Denver market *Jeopardy!* airs on the local Fox affiliate (Fox 31). Sinclair recently bought Fox 31 and started airing *Jeopardy!* at 5:58 PM. I always miss the opening because I'm still watching the evening news on CBS 4.\s\sAnyway they pushed *Jeopardy!* up so they'd have two more minutes for one of their daily propaganda segments.\s\sFuck Sinclair and fuck Fox.https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/By the end the word Democracy had zero meaning anymore.

0,ConspiracyII,esist,203,"Quite horrific if true and on a whole different level from other complaints against him. \s\s>Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear like Maria a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.\s\sHowever the suit was [dropped by the complainant in 2016](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dismissed/). Her lawyer claimed that there had been new death threats and Jane Doe had asked them to drop the case.Okay but seriously wtf? If a crime was committed The state should be responsible for pursuing legal action separate from the victim and regardless of their requests. If someone kills someone else the prosecution wouldn’t just drop it because the victims family asked them to. This is aggravated sexual assault on a minor. what the actual fuck.I’ve seen an interview where this plaintiff described the scenario with Maria. My thought was she may have been taken out to sea and put overboard from an Epstein yacht.[deleted]It isn't as if the country doesn't care. Over 1/2 the country cares a great deal but the justice department has blocked prosecution of the president so it seems like 4 years and no action. There will be a new sheriff in town.Yes and the [case was dropped in 2016](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dismissed/) after the accuser (according to her lawyer) received new death threats.I posted this on FB and some people replied by posting the document that the charges had been dropped. The right is always going to find something that dismisses or “debunks” any claims by the left.Yeah I showed this to Trump supporters and they brushed it off as “if he’s guilty then Trump would have been charged.”As a Republican voter would say ""at least Trump isn't a Democrat.""No one cares about the answers we already have to things. We want some grandiose event that alters the course of our species so we don't have to change or do any work cause we lazy fucking sloths lol also this is crayI careEhh we don’t *know*... thede sre just allegations... very disturbing ones tho... if we knew for sure there would likely be some consequences... but we dont sadly.Nope it was never reported on. So much for the liberal media.A lot of that probably has to do with the document being fake and all.I can't understand why this isn't more widely known and talked about. Every T**** cultist should be confronted with it at every opportunity. Everyone else should know about it and remember this is the person the world is dealing with.They immediately pivot to ""Well Clinton was too!"" as if that somehow nullifies the charge.\s\sFuck it. Lock them both up.Completely agree. Slightly random question but I've noticed a few news outlets and others use asterisk for trump's name like you did I hadn't noticed it before so it seems like a new thing. What's the word on that?They have been and they just don't care. Like most of Trump's wrong doing the cultists believe it is fake news or a liberal plot to undermine Trump. \s\sThey'll say something like: *""Accusations don't mean he did anything he's rich and people go after rich folk all the time with made up stories because they want money.""*\s\sThen they'll start ""what about-ing"" Bill Clinton's frequent trips on Epstein's private jet and how Hillary emails and how she ran a child sex trafficking ring and why isn't anyone prosecuting them?you're more likely to turn trump supporters into pedophiles if you end up convincing them trump raped children than having them condemn him for it.Except the case was dropped so they see that as it being fake not as a response to death threats.>I can't understand why this isn't more widely known and talked about.\s\sHave you looked into it? There are actual reasons this was not more widely known and talked about.\s\sThe people bringing the lawsuit were known grifters no media outlet was able to verify any part of the story (and in fact it's not really clear whether the victim even exists) and the lawsuit was dropped before it had to stand up to any scrutiny by a court which makes it no more dependable than a random comment on the internet.\s\sIn other words this accusation was about on the same level as the rape accusation against Biden or Trump's lawsuits about election fraud. I can't say for sure it was false but it definitely wasn't proven or corroborated.Meanwhile at QAnon:\s\s🦗🦗🦗 *chirp* *chirp* *chirp*Because it is always projection...they point the finger at their opponents because they are guilty themselves. It’s the classic “Look over there!” Act....just read on Reddit a q-anon leader was arrested on child porn. It never fails because half of Americans are exploitable idiots....Q is literally the Russian trolls distracting people from real facts. I have held this theory for awhile. I also think Flat Earth is Russian trolls.13 years old.So is this 26 sexual assault charges now?Yes and had two different mostly unrelated child sex traffickers working out of his properties that he was known friends and business partners with.Wow. What’s the status of this case now?https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/comments/kgs9ju/trump_raped_a_kid_together_with_epstein_heres_the/gghezkp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3Evil at the very coreI looked into this about a year ago.\s\sI was able to pull this document from the docket so I believe that the document itself is genuine.\s\sThat said there’s a whole lot of’ what happens next’ that’s missing. I was told that it could be because the allegations were withdrawn or settled out of court. I wish I knew the truth because what’s described in the document is absolutely wicked.The docket? Can you explain what you mean by this? I’m looking to understand if this is a real document. The domain is a little weird and  it’s making me skeptical.Everytime I read this document it breaks me. They were babies my God they are just babies. And we know it's more than just one or two. 12 and 13 years old. They were terrified and the pain is unbearable intolerable. My heart is so heavy for them. I don't even have anything to add I just feel so much rage and pain for them.Just ONE reporter. Just one with the public listening. ""Sir do you now regret raping a child with Jeffery Epstein?""\s\sWe need to grow teeth in this nation or we're done.Trump purposefully distanced himself from reporters for this type of reason.It’s true. Snopes it.I had a coworker that claims to be independent tell me that Biden was a pedo. I said how can he be a pedo when Trump had a lawsuit against him for raping a 13 year old. He said ""well they dropped the charges so he was never convicted"" ok then. One had charges and one has never had any and the one with no charges is the pedo? Fucking weird.[deleted]Yep. I honestly don’t expect him to ever face legal justice. I hope he waives his SS protection after he is out of office though. There’s only one kind of justice he deservesCome 20 Jan Trump & family become ""America's Most Wanted"".  Enjoy!I think this is probably true. However a ""legal document"" isn't proof or a conviction. It's an allegation. Framing it this way gives the right ammunition. \s\sBe honest in all of your arguments.Imagine being an apologist to a white supremacist and child rapist.You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth. \s \sThe document exists.\s \sThat's more then enough to be disqualifying and 10 times more truth than what 70+ million Americans have chosen to believe against all evidence and common sense. Don't chastise your compatriot for the framing chastise your enemy for the portrait.Having an actual court doc is very different than ""just"" allegations.  This opens the victim up to investigations opposed to heresy and conjecture in a tabloid.Ok so . . . will Trump be prosecuted?LolNot a chance.  No prosecutor is going to go after a 26 year old rape case with nothing but an allegation.  If there was substantial physical or eyewitness evidence then we wouldn't be at this stage.  This case is dead in the water.Why is this shocking? The man was is and will always be a pig. Period.13 is almost too old in some of the bible belt states. Some people may be confused by the reference to ""on the younger side"" but probably not outraged.Beep. Boop.

But Brann is a registered Republican and a former member of the conservative Federalist Society. Toomey who played an influential role in his appointment said Brann was “a longtime conservative Republican whom I know to be a fair and unbiased jurist.”> U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann granted a request from Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar to dismiss the suit which alleged that Republicans had been illegally disadvantaged because some counties allowed voters to fix errors on their mail ballots. The judge’s decision which he explained in a scathing 37-page opinion was a thorough rebuke of the president’s sole attempt to challenge the statewide result in Pennsylvania. Brann wrote that Trump’s campaign had used “strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations” in its effort to throw out millions of votes.\sWe won a little.

Prostitutes in Moscow.  \s\sHere's the thing: Hotels in Russia often have ""staff hookers"".  Literally.  I mean I've seen them hanging out in the lobby and sure enough you check in and get a knock on the door asking If you want company.  Then of course there are tons of services who will send a beavy of beauties (and Russian girls are stunning) to your hotel room.  I think it's easier to order a quality hooker in Russia than a quality pizza.  And delivery is probably faster.\s\sSo you can't tell me that ""grab em by the pussy"" Donald didn't avail himself of this cornucopia of love for sale when he was there.  \s\sBut let's assume he didn't and spent his time reading Mein Kampf or something.  It was Intelligence Work 101 to support him.  I mean what a no brainer.  We spend billions on three letter agencies every year to do shit like this.  Of course the Russians will too.That’s a nice appetizer but we’ve been ready for main course for some time nowWaiting and waiting and waiting. Is there such a thing as waiting porn?I personally won’t believe it til I see it. Sounds like Russian trolling/counter-intelligence.Shocking. A plan since the 70’s to gaslight and manipulate Americans into electing and keeping GOPers in power. And people eat this propaganda up. SAD.Yep. Fox was created to prevent another watergate and by that I don’t mean burglaries. Their mission is to make sure republican loyalty never waivers again.They did a good job creating the hall of mirrors that extends from earth to cyberspace - the conspiracy websites everywhere of every kind has made it hard for people to trust any outside new information.  How to fix that?Wait really? He submitted these broadcast proposals to Haldeman? I never knew that. God damn we really are haunted by Nixon's head in a bell jar. Aroo!r/unexpectedfuturamaAlways gonna be some rich asshole willing to spew lies to further extend their greed and lust for power and control. The disturbing result of that are the people who believe the lies; our neighbors co-workers friends. These last three+ years have shown ME who THOSE people REALLY are. I have fewer friends much more sterile relationships with co-workers and adversarial relationships with neighbors. NOW we've got our elected officials church pastors and even MLB umpires conservatives-all threatening ANYONE who disagrees with them. Remind me again?.. who exactly IS the problem?for some added heartbreak this article was written in 2011.Don’t forget the Fairness Doctrine which was repealed in the 80s. Its job was to ensure that each side of a political argument was represented with equal time.Because Republicans have become so willing to lie on TV now reinstating this might give them a greater platform to push false narratives. My concern would then be that Fox News would then use every trick in the book to undercut any competent or compelling information from non-conservatives*.\s\sI use ""conservative"" here loosely as it has now become the Trump party.So if the Fairness Doctrine was reinstated would that solve the problem? From my perspective much of our current political division is driven by partisan media corporations. Fox News feeds it's viewers a steady stream of lies and spin (or flat out refuses to cover news that is damaging to the president).Roger Aisles worked in the Nixon administration didn't he?Communications director.There would be no president Trump if not for fucking Fox News.Gave Bush the Whitehouse.Except now Paul Ryan is on the board of Fox and supposedly he's none too happy with Trump and is slowly turning the network against him.  Maybe it's actually possible to be so big of an asshole that even Fox begins to shun you.> With that in mind the anonymous GOP official urged the creation of a network ""to provide pro-Administration videotape hard news actualities to the major cities of the United States."" Aware that the national television networks were the enemy the writer proposed going around them by sending packaged edited news stories and interviews with politicians directly to local television stations.\s\sThis sounds pretty much exactly like what Sinclair does with the news broadcasts on local stations they own.Can we get a Super PAC to start running a campaign against Fox News specifically?  Is that allowed?The problem is that due to them Republican voters have been elected worse and worse candidates. It will eventually destroy the party.Reminder: Fox Noise is an Australian export in the way of Rupert Murdock Roman Catholic. Murdock was so reviled by Australia they booted him and his ""tabloid news"" concept out of the country. He found welcoming hands in Amerika and became a multi-billionaire. He is a Vatican Apologist Agent (VAA). This is the white-jesus white 'christian' cult. The origin center and perpetuator of the white-jesus white 'christian' cult is the Vatican Italy. Nobody asks why a supposed Middle Eastern religion is coming out of and being administered by a small city-state in the middle of Europe and what relevance that has with the North and South American continents? Yet they are permeated through and through with this cult. The other Australian exports for this present situation are Julian Assange and Ken Ham both also being booted from Australia for being too Australian. Ken Ham is the sole person behind the whole 'white jesus freak' movement that started in the late 1970's that has mutated into this conclave huddled up in the White-jesus White-Nationalist 'evangelical' Republican Party approximately 45% of the American voting electorate about 60 million.  \s  \sSuch is the power of Old Jewish Fairy Tales.Uh.

It’s obviously objectively not even remotely like fox. Take your MUH BOTH SIDEZ and shove it.[removed]Fox is not there to ""counter balance"" anything. The creator of Fox News Roger Ailes designed Fox News explicitly as a way to prevent another Nixon catastrophe. Not to prevent Nixons from being president but to prevent them from being removed or forced to resign. It was launched originally with the mantra ""fair and balanced"" after about 10 years of anti-media propoganda primarily from Rush Limbaugh. That decade of ""the media is biased against us"" before Fox News was launched was also part of the plan. Before Rush Limbaugh there was no ""media bias"" in the zeitgeist. The ""media bias"" had to be created specifically so extremist right-wing propaganda could launch itself as a fair and balanced alternative to the ""media bias"" (a bias that didn't exist before they themselves said it did).As a foreigner living in the US my experience with watching TV has been that MSNBC and CNN (etc) are certainly somewhat skewed in their reporting but Fox News is clinically insane in the way their twist facts spin stories and overload their base with hateful rethoric. \s\sI'm just one person so take this however you want but this is my objective experience of living among you for a few yearsAnyone quoting the website linked here as proof of anything can get bent. You’re insane if you believe that crap.Project Veritas has been caught multiple times trying to fabricate news stories so you might wanna find a different source my dude. \s\sThat being said CNN and MSNBC aren't perfect and are beholden to their bias. But most people realize finding multiple sources is important and if you do that you realize that for Fox News to be accurate even 50% of the time every single other news source has to be false. \s\sThat just ain't it chief.Upvote just for ""Oaf Keepers"".What a fantastic typoCan we refer to them as the Meatl(oaf) Keepers?Oath keepers should be listed as a terrorist organization and be outlawed domestically and internationally.The Party of Evil.What a typo.  Oak Keepers.  I try not to call people names but this is apropos.Yours is a typo. I don’t think oaf is.Wtf is wrong with people like Stewart Rhodes? Im starting to think we should bring back gladiator pits just so these tough guys dont have to go to such extremely convoluted and publicly dangerous methods of getting their kinks. Give em a space to play soldier and good riddance. I wish i was purely joking.Republicans think all’s fair in politics.“Oaf keepers” is such a better name! It’s quite literal! ha ha ha!Time to throw all of them to the lions in colosseumswhy bother with a military coup.  They are going to get an idiot coup after the loss of control of the congress next year.Fuck the oaf keepers and all the rest of the red team. But also fuck the government. Guns for everyone. Voting is less than useless. And fuck the military too. \s\sThey are all murderous treasoneers. We used to hang traitors...If they only had one copy and it was soooooo important why would you ship your only copy without making a copy first? I in no way believe this existed to begin with but let’s pretend it did...who would do that ???not to mention they had pictures of the documents for the shipping company to identify. so they took pictures but never made copies.... sure buddy...""Here's the proof of a conspiracy that involves all layers of government!  Were going to send it by the United States federal mail service!""For real. I make copies of stuff I send to the DMV. No way I'm not copying the *only* documents that prove *whatever* before mailing. lol boatshoes mcmailerson sent the only known copy.Apparently Hunter Biden took his three laptops to a blind man (a guy who can’t recognize faces but knows it was Hunter Biden of all people because of a sticker for a charity in his car?) thousands of miles away about as far across the country as possible and then forgot that he did that leaving his computers there for months with tons of sensitive information on them. The blind man reported them to the FBI after digging through Hunters emails something that no one would waste their time trying to do and when the FBI supposedly refused to act on these incredibly damning emails full of typos vague language and ridiculous plot holes he somehow decided and was able to get in contact with Rudy fucking Giuliani? I mean these people will believe anything.Because this was intentional. It's a very very shitty chess move but an intentional one.\s\sThe gambit is now to claim that Biden's connections run so deep that they made sure to intercept the delivery and (for some reason) rather than simply take the whole package and throw it away they opened it up and removed the documents. \s\sI'd like to repeat that. \s\sRather than doing the *FAR MORE OBVIOUS AND IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE* step of simply throwing the package away entirely Tucker is claiming they *OPENED IT REMOVED THE DOCUMENTS AND THEN SENT THE EMPTY PACKAGE*.Remember no sane person would ever believe Tuckerbecause UNLIKE the DEMOKKKRATS the REPULBICALS have SOME DECENCY like our GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP and dont WHISTLEBLOW or LEAK INFO like his DEMOCRAT AIDESWhy wouldn't they fax it or something.  Anytime I need to send my boss paper work I send it via my phone with an app cause I don't own a printer.\s\sEdit or scannerOkay Joseph SmithDumb dumb dumbHere’s the winner! Right here folks! I literally laughed out loud.Tomorrow’s episode he will explain how he heard faint whispering all day today and gradually he was able to hear it more clearly.  \s\sHe began chiseling it onto his granite tabletop and is in the process of translating this strange language that he and he alone can understand. This isn’t over folks!As founder of /r/exmormon I love this comment so much.And it came to pass...I did too!!!Fuckin Pony Express suck back in those days.The sad part is that this type of lie will work just as well on people today as it did on people back then.‘But they were totally legit and not faked at all. Really!’Because it’s standard procedure to mail the only copy of documents or evidence. Even an idiot knows you scan the documents and send the pdf.“They just go to a different school and my dog ate them!”Ah... the old Joseph Smith defense.just ask Putin to make an extra copyBut any reasonable person knows that he's for entertainment purposes only.So. Much. This. \s\sChrist they are literally the number one cable news channel and got thier supporters frothing over the ""mAiNsTrEaM mEdIa""... bitch you ARE THE MAINIEST OF STREAMSProblem is there are a lot of unreasonable peopleI don't think we can label anyone who watches Tucker as... ""reasonable.""I was playing a game on my phone the other day and a fox news ad came up stating that it's an entertainment network.He sent it to his girlfriend in Canada.She goes to a different school!And cant find her cause she's out dogsledding.Shit her name is Alberta she lives in Vancouver.I wonder if Tucker has an uncle that works at Nintendo?i don't know which would be less believable the canada part or the girl partRemember voters: They are NOT this stupid. \s\sThis is how stupid they think YOU are.Right can you imagine if Rachel Maddow ""lost"" the evidence?  Tucker would do the whole show from the beach in the Bahamas and FOX would finally declare the War on Christmas wonI won $1mil but I lost the ticket. You believe me right?I sent you payment but it must have gotten lost somewhere.I won $114m but I crashed on a magical islandSad thing is the trumpers will eat this shit up instead of accept the whole thing was a lieSome of them over at r/conservative are calling it mickey mouse shit others are saying it could be the incredibly sly reverse bluff to try and get Biden to come out and say something himself now before they drop the hammer down out of nowhere like boom and own them there liberals YEEHAWWWWell yeah they are fucking morons.His dog ate his homework.It's a damn shame there's not a ubiquitous machine for reproducing paper documents.  Shucks. Wait no that's right there is one but it doesn't work for reproducing imaginary documents. They have to be real documents.[I have no idea what you're talking about](https://youtu.be/PZbqAMEwtOE)And the straws they grasped at weren't even there.OMG *""We gave them pictures of what we sent so they would know what to look for"".* Yet you can't or won't show the ""pictures"" to us Tucker?!?!?!!! Wouldn't that be a ""copy"" of the ""evidence"" you say you have?!?!!!!\s\sYou know what Fuck You Tucker you Suck You Lying Piece of Shit!This is the fakest shit on top of fake shit.Good god that is hilarious.\s\sHoly crap I really do try to stay non-partisan but this election season the Republicans are acting like Keystone Cop doofuses.\s\sOf all of the ways for one of the greatest nations in the history of human civilization to go down... Having comic morons like today's Republican party provoke a self-inflicted implosion like this on America is just... It's an epic tragic comedy the likes of which even Shakespeare could not have crafted.It would be comedy if it weren't for the fact so many people are gullible enough to buy it. That's what makes it translate out to more tragedy as far as I'm concerned.It has to be Rudy safeguarding them in case the Biden crime family comes for Tucker /sHe’s going to spin this and say “mail in ballots are full of fraud look what happened to the Biden evidence.” And the idiots will eat it up.but this wasn't USPS according to Carlson.  He won't say who it was obviously because it's pure fiction.Tucker Carlson was called a prophet dum dum dum dum dum"" it's a total coincidence this information is just coming out now after a year of foreshadowing from the Murdoch press""\s\s""sorry I didn't see who dropped of the laptop! I'm blind""\s\s""I didn't give info to the authorities I gave into the notoriously unreliable Murdoch press cos no one else would be willing to publish it""Wait is this satire?Always has beenMy dog ate my homework.Just go to Rudy’s place and get a copy? What? He lost them too?!You know who might have another copy Tuck? Your ""confidential source"". Or are they *also* too dumb to make copies?Does this shit actually work in the echo chamber of horror?  I read somewhere recently he has the largest viewer base in cable news.  Clearly credibility isn’t one of the reasons holy shit.My dog ate the evidence. But honest Biden's guilty!\s\sTrumpublicans: Good enough![Just a reminder that Fox News successfully argued in court that Tucker Carlson's show is purely for entertainment and that no 'reasonable viewer' would take him seriously.](https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-karen-mcdougal-case-tucker-carlson-2020-9)You mean his dog didn’t eat it? \s\sOh wait! I forgot. Damaged people like Trust Fund Tucker The Human Boat shoe can’t have pets because they have no love for anyone else except themselves.""fake news""It's easy to lose stuff that never existed.What's the tracking # there Tuck?""The dog ate my homework""O_oLet me guess. Did your dog eat it?Well if those documents were sent through the US mail then they probably got mixed up with the mail-in ballots.Happens all the time. Why just this week I was excited to receive the November edition of ""Armed Socialist Revolutionary's Home Journal"" (it's the bumper edition with the knitting patterns - I *really* wanted to make that jaunty Che Guevara beret) but instead all I got was 77436 spoiled ballots that had variations of the name ""Predsinent Tmrump"" written in crayon on the ""write-in candidate"" line.This doofus is at least entertaining.Too bad technology doesn't exist to copy documents or electronically transfer them to the opposite coast. The fact that Tucker feels that he can feed his audience with this lie says so much about him and them and none of it is healthy.Who the hell mails physical documents anymore ?He said they showed the searchers of the packet a picture of it so they could identify it..I'd love to see that pic and a time stamp.Tucker you dumb motherfucker!Ahh...the dog ate my homework methodology.  It works trust me!  💯Sounds like he should be fired.   Complete incompetence is in most jobs...UH.Motherfuckers are just playing around now trying to see what's the dumbest shit they can sell to their fans.1. Sure you did\s\s2. Who the fuck doesn’t make a dozen copies of this “document”?The same writers who work on Tucker Carlson also work on One Life To Live.\s\s&#x200B;\s\sBoth shows suck.The biggest political scandal in the US ever and they only have one document without copies and Tucker lost it!??  I guess when your entire audience apparently has dementia any crazy unlikely thing is possible.I hope everyone realizes this is actually part of the deep state gambit. \s\s[Look at how Fox is reporting it](https://imgur.com/a/tRZ9Tom). \s\sThey're going to double down on the conspiracy and say they were intercepted and stolen.What other evidence is needed to know that this guy is a joke of a man and a terrible faith bad actor who is a liar.I'm pretty sure the reason he won't say the name of the shipping company is because they'd refute his story in it's entirety.I wonder if we should remind Carlson that Hunter Biden isn't running for an office. Just because trump has his whole family running the white house doesn't mean Biden will do the same.Fucking scooby doo!How convenient lolThis is the most pathetic case of ‘my dog ate my homework’ in historyHey it happens. I lost the videotape of the second shooter from Dallas the day JFK died as well as the holy grail from Indiana Jones 3. FML!LOCK HIM UP!!!“What’s the tracking number?”\s“My Canadian girlfriend has it”.I really thought this was satire.This can't possibly qualify as real news.Maybe he left it at the house of his girlfriend. She goes to a different school you don't know herSo the Angel Moroni stole it?Thing is 40% of Americans will actually call this statement “evidence.”Extraordinary claims require having extraordinary evidence.I always wonder if they realize how stupid this makes them look. Like you didn’t make multiple copies? You didn’t insure and track it? If it was so damning you didn’t have the production advisor fly it out with a hand cuffed suitcase?Translation: he had jack shit got caught in his lies and is now trying to save faceNext in the news:  Trump fires DeJoyTotally NOT a cult...Wow.  Why is he withholding the name of the shipping company?  Maybe so no one can fact check him? So I guess he’s insinuating Biden somehow intercepted them?  \s\sLet’s just say this is all true.  It shows the total incompetence of Tucker and his “news” team.  They have the smoking gun they’ve wanted so badly a “treasure trove” of documents.   They decide to ship it across the country without making copies?  Smart.  This guy is a dirtbag.Aha ha hahahahahaha!  Riiiiight.They are going to blame democrats for stealing the only copy of some important ass documents that never existed in the first place to get their supporters riled up. I fucking hate people so much.Nobody at Fox has a camera or scanner or fax or copy machine?  lol!  My six year old neighbor downloads his iPad artwork to the cloud.He should have just said his dog ate itSure Jan.""My dog ate my evidence""My dog ate themSure Jan.Why do we post shit about an entertainment show stop giving him credibility.That's okay. Your tears say more than real evidence ever could.He was that stupid kid at school who thought ""the dog ate my homework"" was super clever and believable.Ol’ butterfingers Carlson strikes again![Well this is awkward](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8894445/UPS-Hunter-Biden-package-Tucker-Carlson-claimed-destroyed.html)Dear Tucker information security has three pillars:\sConfidentiality Authenticity and wait for it...

Then the production assistant's friend's cousin's wife's dog ate them.\s\sBut they were absolutely real and super damning!There’s a reason he’s had a long career on a laughingstock rancid fake news propaganda outlet for hydra-headed underachieving lunatics. He’s exactly as stupid and lying and hypocritical and callous and cruel and entitled as his livelihood requires. THIS is “conservatism.”This might be the dumbest thing that Tucker Carlson has ever done...and that is saying something...Don't forget Carlson is legally entertainment and legally no reasonable person should take him seriouslyHis excuse sets this up as an even bigger conspiracy theory. They sent it via UPS or FedEx it was lost but then found opened with the contents missing. No evidence on camera no one saw anything no nothing. He's insinuating that there's a spy on the Biden team that found out when the package was getting mailed infiltrated a package sorting facility posed as a worker stole the papers and then was dumb enough to leave behind the evidence of the packaging. It's ridiculous just hearing it but knowing how things go in a sorting facility for one of those big companies it's even that much more preposterous.This isn't even satire anymore.His dog ate it. Gut the puppy open and get those printed emails out quick. This is important shit.It’s 2020. They didn’t scan these documents to make a digital copy? They didn’t make hard copies? They really sent the ONLY copy they had? I don’t buy it. This is conspiracy manufacturing at a base and pathetic level.It’s been a constant stream of this bullshit in r/conspiracy.

The declassified FOIA files on this subject are widely available online.Neofacists are real folks. They have infiltrated much of government. They love this shit.

0,ConspiracyII,MarchAgainstTrump,35,"Read section 10.\s\sTrump ties a 13 year old to a bed rapes and beats her while threatening her with death and shouting that he can do whatever he wants.\s\sThe President of America folks. And a significant portion of Americans worship this piece of shit.A horrible piece of shit.Don't ignore pages 11-15; they contain what each witnessed and both mention a 12 year old Maria; what are the chances of finding that Maria these days?Also notice the Witness worked for Epstein for 10 years which is easily verified.  If this case contained any falsehoods it would be easy to fight in court but since the plaintiff was pressured to drop it in 2016 with threats of death that means the case is likely to succeed.Putin must have some crazy shit on Trump.When the Trump shit-show couldn't possibly get any lower you find out he tied a 13 year-old kid to a bed raped and beat her.I knew about it in 2016 when it was filed the first time before the plaintiff was threatened to drop the case.\s\sMost people should know about this makes it really hard to think of republicans as human beings.this case is old as fuck and everyone should’ve known about it in 2016. everyone. seriously where were you?"" Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted ""\s\sCouldn't have been written to sound more like how Trump would act.  \s\s\sYet through all this his supporters will just go 'but Biden sniffed a girl's hair so he's worse.'Let’s not even start down a “whatabout” path and let whatever merits there might be in this case stand on their own.  This has zero to do with Biden and we shouldn’t even entertain any discussion about him.literally had that exact argument on Facebook.  I posted these documents and they brushed them off and said Biden proved he's a pedophile on TV.  OKSomething something Catholic jokeWhereas we have videos of Biden sniffing hair there is no evidence Trump raped anyone.Meanwhile: some terrifyingly large percentage of america worships and follows the despicable fucker's every word... How fucked is America?70 million people voted for him I just can't fathom it.This kind of story only bolsters Trump's support among Conservatives. Republican voters are obsessed with sexual violence and cruelty in general.When you're a star they let you do it.> Republican voters are obsessed with sexual violence and cruelty in general.\s\sLike all things they do it must be projection.Only when it's against women.  If Trump did this to a boy they'd be calling for his head on a pike because then he would be gayButter emails /s\s\sSeriously not one bit surprised hopefully this will gain some traction now that he's on his way out.I think we should note that he's not going to be president in a couple of weeks' time so it's not a case of someone bringing forth a frivolous suit to make him less popular but perhaps instead in the hope of nailing him once his presidential immunity is over.The case was filed in 2016.And also hopefully raise the question should presidential immunity be a thing?If they do have any sort of immunity. The clock on the statute of limitations should be paused during that time.Didn’t this story come out during the whole Epstein thing years ago? It just got lost in the noise. \s\sI’m finally watching Bombshell and it’s an uncomfortable reminder of how misogynistic Trump was proven to be BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED. And 49.9% of voters didn’t fucking care. \s\sThe people that support this man are morally defective and will have to answer for it. I vote for a social boycott until that happens.> And 49.9% of voters didn’t fucking care.\s\sHis misogyny is a feature for them. Not a problem.While this is very likely completely true it isn't really evidence of anything because the plaintiffs dropped it due to death threats.*Good thing the justice system works huh.*\s\sWhat a sick joke.tHeY’rE JuSt TaLkInG sO tHeY gEt PaId - qanonNo one could possibly make up a story like thisHashtag this with something get it trending get the news to cover that because we all know they won't cover an old case. But a Hashtag relating to an old case that brings controversy? Oh they will eat that shit up.How does qanon love this guy when he’s the one raping kids? I thought that’s what they’re all againstI remember a few months ago turning point usa had a video saying  how the trump rape case was bullshit I noticed how  when more evidence came out against trump that video mysteriously disappeared.Always wondered how donald has escaped the epstein conspiracy theories. Seems like suspect number one to me.Does someone have a good summary? I know they were acquitted but wonder what facts were agreed toThey were not acquitted. The plaintiff received several death threats and dropped the case.Jesus my sleep-deprived brain read that as raised a kid together. I was like WHAT?So cool and normal that criminal cases are tried the same was as small claims on Judge Judy.Wtf.I'm assuming that this hasn't been proven? Much as I dislike Trump and anyone who has anything to do with him including supporting him. \s\sDon't the FBI investigate things like this and the alleged death threats?\s\sCan they complete investigation after January without fear?If the flight records and other physical evidence placing them at the scene together in 1994 along with all current evidence against the late Jeffrey Epstein are not enough for you: there is also the recent evidence where the plaintiff started receiving threats of death immediately after filing this suit in 2016 when it was unlikely to be a publicized case.  Also very few people should know the girl's identity given her anonymity in the court filing.\s\sTrump claiming to have a 15 year relationship with Epstein in 2002 means this information shouldn't surprise you.\s\sOne of the witnesses worked for Epstein at the time and even after until 2000 after 10 years of employment which is easily verifiable.\s\sThe chances of Trump winning this case are basically none and the only thing keeping this out of criminal case is the statute of limitations: the assaults happened in 1994-95.\s\sThe investigation is over evidence was likely collected years in advance and court will proceed at the end of Trump's term in office.[removed]Because it’s from 2016. And it was news then but no one fucking cared.Let’s say you’re a major news organization. You’d have to get the plaintiff to provide proof of death threats threats which you assume were credible enough to get them to drop a rape case. Incredibly unlikely. \s\sWithout that verifiable evidence it’s hearsay at best and opens your network up to countless lawsuits seeking monetary damages for running it.You can read it yourself it isn't very long.\s\sOne of the witnesses worked for Epstein for 10 years.  Epstein's human trafficking empire is no secret and Trump admitted to knowing Epstein for over 15 years in 2002.  Flight records also placed them together at the time shortly before the events.\s\sSince the employment of the witness and the therapy of the plaintiff are all easily verifiable then it should be easy to fight in court assuming Trump's innocence.  Why then would they send threats of death to the plaintiff such as they did in 2016 causing her to drop the case?You can look up the case for yourself on PACER.post that on /r/iamatotalpieceofshitJust proves ICE is just a business and their product is xenophobiaOmg such bad timing! It was getting to be ""put up or shut up"" time. How is he going to own the libs now?!?Very Sad! And the timing is just so sad as well!

Imagine if they wanted to start stealing elections a while back maybe even did and almost got caught in 2016. So they start talking it up constantly against the Democrats of course. They keep the noise going so long that nobody wants to hear about it and the Democrats can't accuse them of anything in future elections after insisting elections are not crooked.

0,ConspiracyII,ActiveMeasures,25,"> When conspiracy theories about the Trump-Russia connection are posted to /r/conspiracy they are often met a heavy amount of “skepticism”. That would be perfectly OK if this “skepticism” didn’t come from the same conspiracy theorists who believe that QAnon is real and that a powerful pedophile ring operated in the basement of a pizza place that didn’t actually have a basement.\s\sThis is what does it for me. The extreme skepticism of any narrative that dares to use evidence while adhering to QAnon blindly and with religious fervor.I think pretty much everyone knows thisPretty thorough analysis however....couldn't make it through the full article but backs up that assumption we all have fairly well with a lot of evidence.Yup. Nice to see to further evidence of this though.The sub has always been right leaning but it used to be a pretty good space for pulling right wingers to the left. \s\sThey’re naturally skeptical of corporations and power structures so you could make small victories here and there. At the very least I’ve convinced a lot of Trump voters not to vote for trump a second time because he’s just as in bed with elites. \s\sNow the mods of that sub of always had a heavy hand in making sure the front page of the sub is full of right wing talking points but it’s gotten especially bad this election season. \s\sThey’ve gone on a banning spree and I think it’s like three or four hundred accounts by now. Anyone who regularly challenged the right wing talking points is gone.How do you know they've been on a banning spree?It used to be interesting but it got taken over years ago[deleted]Yea no. They spread conspiracy theories about a friend of mine who was murdered in cold blood. No one knew a thing about him or the situation and r/conspiracy dragged his name through the mud for months without any evidence.\s\sWhole sub is hot garbage. Always has been...The last kind of a real discussion and research I remember was probably the Las Vegas shooting or Kevin Spacey. Then it got taken overI miss all the UFO and Illuminati conversations.  Good times.[removed]Conspiracy theories are at the core of every fascist movement.\s\sThere was never a conspiracy subreddit that was not run by fascists nor conspiracy-enthusiasts that were not right-wing.\s\sThose theories are cancer eroding our democracies and basically used as a weapon against us.\s\sNice article anyway.This is actually very accurate lets not forget that hatred for others just like with conspiracies is based on gullible people falling for prejudiced falsehoods and misinformation to get them to be emotional angry passionate and then to have them spread the nonsense on. When those people all vote some hatemonger into power bad things happen historically.Fuckin' knew itTranslation from u/Larry17\s\sA. Refrain from positively reporting any kind of protests for democracy or freedom by Hong Kong citizens fully utilize the weight of the voice from the government take the initiative to lead the public opinion by defining the protests as the following:\s\s- Patriotism against Hong Kong Independence\s\s- Peace against violence\s\s- Law against Turmoil(Riot)\s\sB. Adequately report demands for people's livelihood but not too much it should not be the main focal point. It is allowed to change the focus from politics to economy but most importantly is to report the protests as unlawful criminal activity.\s\sC. Downplay the amount of people who participated in the protest as well as the amount of support exaggerate the amount of support for the government and the police characterise the people as followed:\s\s- People who did not came out to protest are the silent majority and they support the police and government.\s\s- People who participated in the protests and marches are igonorant fools who were provoked and incited by the western forces.\s\s- People who sieged government buildings and stood up against police are terrorists.\s\sD. In text based or video based news reports magnify the following points:\s\s- Magnify the people who waved flags of Hong Kong independence or flags of western countries to show that the protesters teamed up with western enemies to achieve independence avoid showing slogans about democracy or freedom.\s\s    Due to the high impact to the international scene we can expect western media to interview politicians and they are expected to support the protesters. We love these kind of statements because that can show the western enemies are behind to stage chaos.\s\s- Magnify reports of protesters sieging government buildings\s\s- Magnify reports of protesters drawing grafitti on Chinese flags and emblems or any other government symbols.\s\s- Magnify reports of protesters' violence agaisnt the police. If any police got injured strongly report it\s\s    Due to the ever-escalating situation we can expect the protests to further impact the people's livelihood. We must focus on the citizens who complained especially the foreigners who expressed their complaints.\s\sE. DO NOT report people who express understanding or even support for the protesters.\s\sF. Delete and censor all kinds of media that shows police brutality immediately they absolutely must not be spread on wechat weibo or any other social media.\s\sG. Delete and censor all kinds of media that shows the protesters apologizing to the tourists stuck in the airport they must be deleted as urgently as possible and must not be spread.\s\sH. Using the economic attractiveness of China convince business person and celebrities to voice out their support for the government and the police force.\s\sI. Highly regulate and censor traditional news media and intensify censorship on social media platforms strongly manipulate the public opinion.You gotta admit it is a pretty good ""cookbook"" with clear guidance for weaving a consistent on-message narrative.\s\sThe sheer cynical evilness aside in terms of structure this reminds me strongly of many large companies' media engagement guides I've seen.Anybody remember the media reporting of the Occupy protests? Seems familiar ...[deleted]This is pretty much the formula for the People’s Daily editorials covering Hong Kong in a nutshellMaybe it leaked because even a lot of people inside the Chinese government sympathize with the protesters. \s\sEven many of the paid shills who spam Twitter and Reddit for China are probably sympathetic to the protesters.Perfect illustration of why attacking the police plays right into the CCPs handsFuck China.This ""leaked document"" is very apparently a fake one though forged comparatively meticulously.\s\sSeveral points that the forger missed: \s\s1. In mainland China standard governmental documents public or confidential must be printed with a red headline and a governmental seal with the main text printed in Imitation Song Font (仿宋體). This forged document did not follow these rules. \sExample of a piece of standard official governmental document in the PRC: (as shown in the picture of this webpage)\shttp://www.ltbar.cn/news/show-2244.html\s\s2. In an authentic governmental document from mainland China words like ""港獨""（""Hong Kong Independence"") should always be quoted in double quotation marks. For words like 民主(democracy) or 自由(freedom) when being used by people against the PRC they should also be quoted in quotation marks. Apparently this forged document missed this point. \s\s3. Take a closed look at the paragraph marks of this forged document: 一 二 三 三 四 五 六 七 八， where the word 三( meaning ""three"" or ""III"") appeared twice ! This shows that the document was forged in a haste without much proofreading. \s\s4. For protesters who used violence the most common denomination for them in official Chinese media is 暴徒(thug or bandit). This word did not appear even once in this forged document.\s\s5. In paragraph 三 4（the second 三），there is the expression (塗鴉國旗國徽)，which is not authentic mainland Chinese expression. 塗鴉 means ""drawing graffiti"". The correct Chinese verb here should be 毀損，污損 or 玷污，etc but never 塗鴉.\s\s6. In paragraph 三 2（the second 三），there appeared several times the wording 西方媒體（Western media). In fact when it comes to non-PRC media who tend to take an oppositional position against the PRC Chinese official media tend to classify them with the word 境外媒體 (media outside of the border) rather  than 西方媒體. (Lots of non-Western media like Al Jazeera or many from Taiwan also tend to publish negative things on the CCP as we know. )\s\s7. In paragraphs 五&六，there is an expression 微信微博以及任何社交媒體 ，which is apparently written by a Chinese speaker who never worked in secretarial documents or journalism. The correct way of wording should be :  微信、微博等任何社交媒體\s\s8. In paragraph 七，this forged article used the word 大陸 to designate ""mainland China"" which is in fact politically incorrect in official PRC documents. When it comes to mainland China compared to Hongkong or Macau the correct word for ""mainland China"" is 內地.  The word 大陸 is only used when it comes to the comparison with Taiwan. \s\s9. In paragraph 八， there is a weird expression 刪查力度. The more authentic expression should be 審查力度.  \s\s\sAll in all this document has been forged by someone who is very probably a native Chinese-speaker though never having actually worked in journalism or governmental clerk positions in mainland China. And it has been forged in a haste without much proofreading.I saw some of that in two comments on another post a few minutes ago.  One was blatant and obvious the other tried unsuccessfully to be sneaky.  I let them both know what losers they are.> I saw some of that in two comments on another post a few minutes ago.

I let them both know what losers they are.\s\sSpeaking as a moderator for one of the bigger subreddits: be careful what you say and don't get yourself banned. \s\sIt's helpful if people challenge these disinformation campaigns but it breaks my heart when I have to remove comments or issue bans because someone started namecalling in response (or gets a permaban for telling them to kill themselves etc).\s\sIn fact some of these disinformation trolls rely on people over-reacting in response to them and subtly provoke it -- it lets them pose as the aggrieved party.  It also helps silence voices opposing them.   They call this [sealioning](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sea-lioning)It's crazy to me how much public information there is like looking up the owner of a site but people still don't look at it to see if what they're seeing is true and made by authentic people.Fact-checking takes a lot of time and energy though and those resources are limited for a lot of people. They likely had much higher priorities in their lives like financial stress from losing their job and having to homeschool their kids and so on which made them more vulnerable to disinfo ops like this.There's a lot of that these days the GOP started astroturfing to split Oregon and give it to Idaho Oregon should say turnabout is fairplay and move to annex the cities of Idaho.Who does it benefit? Putin of course.Why did this post get deleted? Just went to read it again[removed]That's about the dumbest thing you could possibly say.

These filters prevented dangerous ideas—like democracy equality and peace—from reaching the readers of mass media. They identified five of those filters: Concentrated media ownership helped ensure that media reflected the will of its wealthy corporate owners; reliance on official sources forced journalists and editors to make compromises with the powerful to ensure continued access; shared ideological premises including the hatred of official enemies biased coverage toward the support of war; the advertising business model filtered out information that advertisers didn’t like; and an organized “flak” machine punished journalists who stepped out of line threatening their careers.>the advertising business model filtered out information that advertisers didn’t like\s\sImagine telling somebody a few decades ago that advertising would control what you do and don’t get to see in a medium...C+ fear-mongering comrade.  you can do better.(looks at your horrendous comments) ok dimitri your shift is over get the fuck out of hereffs Russia isn't communist anymore this is red scare propaganda.https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaLago/comments/pg3yu7/russia_insider_founder_charles_bausman_involved"
